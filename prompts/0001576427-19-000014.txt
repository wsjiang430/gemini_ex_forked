Item 1.    Business 
History and Development of the Company
Criteo S.A. was initially incorporated as a société par actions simplifiée, or S.A.S., under the laws of the French Republic on November 3, 2005, for a period of 99 years and subsequently converted to a société anonyme, or S.A. We are registered at the Paris Commerce and Companies Register under the number 484 786 249. Our agent for service of process in the United States is National Registered Agents, Inc. We began selling elements of our offering in France in 2007 and have since expanded our business into other countries in Western Europe. In 2009, we expanded our business into North America and entered the Asia-Pacific region in late 2010. In November 2016, we acquired HookLogic, Inc. ("HookLogic"), a New York-based company that has developed a performance marketing exchange connecting consumer brands with retail ecommerce sites via sponsored product ads sold by ecommerce retailers. 
Business Overview 
We are a global technology company building the leading Advertising Platform for the Open Internet. We strive to deliver impactful business results at scale to commerce companies and consumer brands by meeting their multiple marketing goals at their targeted return on investment. Using shopping data, predictive technology and large consumer reach, we help our clients drive Awareness, Consideration and Conversion for their products and services1, and help retailers generate advertising revenues from consumer brands. Our data is pooled among our clients and offers deep insights into consumer intent and purchasing habits. To drive measurable results for clients, we activate our data assets through proprietary artificial intelligence ("AI") technology to engage consumers in real time through the pricing and delivery of highly relevant digital advertisements ("ads"), across devices and environments. By pricing our offering on a range of pricing models and measuring our value based on clear, well-defined performance metrics, we make the return on investment transparent and easy to measure for advertisers.
Our vision is to build the leading Advertising Platform for the Open Internet by enabling commerce companies and consumer brands, using our modular and flexible technology platform, to address multiple marketing goals across the open Internet. We define the open Internet as the open, non-proprietary environment that allows advertisers and publishers to choose the partner they want to work with, decide when and how they share data, and control how to measure success.
Over the past 13 years, we have established our market position by focusing on three pillars: actionable commerce data, predictive technology to activate data and drive multiple marketing goals, and large consumer reach. While continuously improving our technology and broadening our reach, we leverage and strengthen Criteo Shopper Graph, a highly differentiated group of data collectives built through collaboration and data pooling within our open ecosystem of commerce and consumer brand clients. With Criteo Shopper Graph, we are building one of the world's biggest and open data sets focused on shoppers, retailers and brands.
Our clients include some of the largest and most sophisticated commerce companies in the world, along with world-class consumer brands. We partner with them to capture user activity on their websites and mobile applications ("apps"), which we define as digital properties, and optimize the performance of their ads based on that activity and other data. Demonstrating the depth and scale of our data, we collected data on over $800 billion in online sales transactions2 on our clients' digital properties in the year ended December 31, 2018. Based on this data and other assets, we delivered targeted ads that generated over 10 billion clicks2 in the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we served more than 19,000 clients and, in each of the last three years, our average client retention rate, as measured on a quarterly basis, was approximately 90%2.

1 Driving Awareness for an advertiser means exposing its brand name to consumers who have not been in touch with the advertiser before, thereby creating brand awareness from such consumers. Driving Consideration for an advertiser's products or services means attracting prospective new consumers to consider engaging with and/or buying this advertiser's products or services. Driving Conversion for an advertiser's products or services means triggering a purchase by consumers who have already engaged with this advertiser's products or services in the past.

Each day we are presented with billions of opportunities to connect consumers with relevant advertising messages from our commerce and consumer brand clients. For each of these opportunities, our algorithms analyze massive volumes of shopping data to predict consumer preferences and intent, and deliver specific messaging for products or services that are likely to engage that particular consumer. The accuracy of our algorithms improves with every advertisement we deliver, as they incorporate new data while continuing to learn from prior interactions.
Historically, the Criteo model had focused solely on converting our clients' website visitors into customers, enabling us to charge our clients only when users engage with an ad we deliver, usually by clicking on it. This pay-for-performance pricing model clearly links the cost of an advertising campaign to its effectiveness in driving conversions, and has been valued as such by our clients. More recently, we have expanded our solutions to address a broader range of marketing and monetization goals for our clients. Doing so, we also started expanding our pricing models to now include a combination of cost-per-install and cost-per-impression for selected new solutions, in addition to cost-per-click, as well as a subscription-type pricing model for large retailers using our technology platform as part of of our Criteo Retail Media offering. 
As commerce companies and consumer brands have embraced our offering, we have achieved significant growth since our inception and are now operating across 98 countries. Our revenue retention rate was 120%, 115% and 101% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively1. We define our revenue retention rate as (i) revenue recognized during a period from clients that contributed to revenue recognized in the prior corresponding period divided by (ii) total revenue recognized in such prior corresponding period. In our view, consistently having over 74% of our Revenue ex-TAC generated from clients that have uncapped budgets2 directly contributes to our ability to maintain a high level of revenue retention. As a result, our ability to retain and grow revenue from our existing clients has been a useful indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our client relationships.
Our financial results include:

• | Revenue of $1,799.1 million, $2,296.7 million and 2,300.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively;


• | Revenue excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs, which we refer to as Revenue ex-TAC, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $730.2 million, $941.1 million and $966.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively;


• | Net income of $87.3 million, $96.7 million and $95.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively; and


• | Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $224.6 million, $309.6 million and $321.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

Please see footnotes 3, 4 and 5 to the "Other Financial and Operating Data" table in "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" in this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of Revenue to Revenue ex-TAC, Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income to Adjusted Net Income, respectively, in each case the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or "U.S. GAAP".

The Advertising Platform for the Open Internet
Our technology is optimized to drive impactful business results for advertisers across multiple marketing goals. While pricing our offering on a range of pricing models, including a cost-per-click, we address a wide range of advertising objectives for our commerce and consumer brand clients, including, for example, customer visits to a client website, installations of a mobile app, and sales. We deliver these measurable business outcomes by efficiently and effectively driving engagement for our clients' products and services, in the form, for example, of Consideration and Conversion, and generating advertising revenue for retailers through the monetization of their data and audiences with consumer brands.
Our offering is powered by AI technology and aims to address the consumer journey (Awareness, Consideration and Conversion). Our offering works seamlessly across digital devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets), commerce and advertising environments (web, mobile applications and physical stores), platforms and operating systems, advertising channels (Display Advertising, including social and native, video, and advertisements on retailers' properties) and publisher environments (Alphabet Inc. ("Google Ad Manager"), multiple real-time bidding exchanges, thousands of publishers and mobile app developers in the open Internet, and Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook")). Our Advertising Platform, as we define it, is available as a unique and comprehensive offering and cannot be broken down and purchased as separate services, except for individual advertising solutions and campaigns.
The Advertising Platform for the Open Internet is comprised of:

• | Criteo Shopper Graph


• | Criteo Platform


• | Our Solutions


• | Our Publisher Network

Criteo Shopper Graph
Through integration with substantially all of our clients' digital properties, we obtain large volumes of browsing behavior data, expressed consumer shopping intent and engagement, and transactional data at the individual product and individual user level.
Our data assets include all insights derived from our clients' proprietary commerce data, such as transaction activity on their digital properties, representing over $800 billion in online sales in 20181.
Access to high quality data assets fuels the accuracy of our algorithms, which improves with the increasing quantity and quality of data we obtain from our clients and publisher partners, as well as insights gained through our own extensive operational history. The combination of advertiser data, publisher data and proprietary metadata gives us powerful insights into consumer purchasing habits that we use to price inventory and create the most relevant ads to drive user engagement and measurable results for our clients. In addition to commerce data at the granular product level, we seek to use as much relevant information as possible about the context and intent of a given user, collected from clients and publisher partners, to further refine our prediction accuracy.
We believe our access to highly granular and qualitative commerce data validates the trust that our clients place in us. For example, for most of our clients, we typically have real-time access to the products or services a visitor has viewed, researched, added to their shopping cart, or bought from them, and continuously receive updated information on 4.5 billion products or services2, including pricing, images and descriptions, which are typically characterized as non-Personally Identifiable Information (or Non-PII). A growing number of our clients also provide us with their customers' purchase history data in formats that are non-PII.
Using a range of cookies and non-cookie based technologies, we collect information about the interactions of users with our clients' and publishers' digital properties. Our clients grant us access to their valuable data through direct integration with us, which requires our clients to place Criteo software code throughout their digital properties. The information we collect does not enable us to personally identify the particular user. 
Over the past few years, we have built three data collectives through data pooling among our clients. The combination of these data collectives forms Criteo Shopper Graph. For each of these data collectives, we ask our clients to grant us the permission to mutualize a significant portion of their proprietary data with other clients who also contribute data to this specific collective data pool. With Criteo Shopper Graph, we are building one of the world's largest and most open data sets focused on shoppers and their commerce activity across retailers and brands. 
Criteo Shopper Graph is comprised of the following three data collectives:

• | The Identity Graph allows us to match user technical identifiers across devices and environments, including online and offline. As of December 31, 2018, 73% of our clients grant us access to some of their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) data, such as hashed customer logins and/or hashed emails, to enable us to match users across multiple digital devices or environments. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 4 billion user IDs3 within our Identity Graph globally, with an estimated average of three user IDs per individual user. The scope of our Identity Graph is already among the best in the industry. In addition, the Identity Graph allows us to leverage offline CRM data of our clients' physical stores to match it with online user profiles, based on their offline shopping history. Since the end of 2015, the Identity Graph has seen strong traction within our client base and, we believe, has become a solid foundation to reach consumers across all devices and environments. The Identity Graph supports and benefits our entire suite of solutions.


• | The Interest Map collects and organizes consumer intent and purchasing data across the products available in our network of commerce clients, in order to build a comprehensive and accurate non-identifying shopper profile for all consumers on whom we have collected data. We collect data on over $800 billion in online sales1 and, every year, we see close to 12 billion shopping transactions taking place within our commerce ecosystem1. With the Interest Map, we seek our clients' permission to use their data to power products that are jointly offered by our clients in the collective. We have built applications for the Interest Map, as well as its underlying infrastructure, including the Universal Catalog, which provides category and brand extraction, as well as a unified view of the 4.5 billion products available across the combined product catalogs of our commerce clients2. The Interest Map is a key foundation to cover compelling marketing goals, including those addressed by our Consideration solutions to help advertisers win new visitors and new customers.

• | The Measurement Network provides SKU-level sales attribution for consumer brands across our network of retailer partners using our Criteo Retail Media solutions. This means that, using our deterministic measurement approach, our consumer brand clients can precisely track and measure the effectiveness of their advertising spend by attributing their sales at the SKU level to the clicks that were generated on their ads across our network of retailers. This permission-based sales attribution, retailer by retailer, is typically not available to consumer brands, neither in the online nor offline world, where they still place most of their trade marketing investments. We plan to widen the Measurement Network to all Criteo retailers with new applications and have already started to add offline sales attribution for consumer brands.

Central to our approach of the open Internet, the design and governance of Criteo Shopper Graph are based on strict and differentiated guiding principles:

• | Openness: we commit to a two-way exchange of data with our clients, whereby all clients contributing data can, in return for their contribution, benefit from the collective dataset via our Advertising Platform, as well as access relevant cross-device user IDs and relevant Key Performance Indicators of their campaigns to better inform and optimize their advertising.


• | Transparency: our clients' contribution and sharing of data within the data pools are based on a clear and permission-based usage by Criteo for the mutual benefits of all participants in the data collectives.


• | Security: as always, we apply the highest data security and user privacy standards to our three data collectives.


• | Fairness: the data collectives are designed and governed in ways such that the value gained by participating clients largely exceeds their individual contribution to the collectives.

Criteo Platform
Criteo AI Engine 
Criteo AI Engine has been developed over the past 13 years and consists of multiple artificial intelligence algorithms, and the proprietary global hardware and software infrastructure that enables our Advertising Platform to operate in real time at significant scale. 
Criteo AI Engine leverages our vast and high-quality data assets, with the goal of maximizing consumer engagement to drive impactful business results for clients through the delivery of highly relevant and personalized ads in real time.
Criteo AI Engine consists of:

• | Lookalike finder algorithms. Recently introduced by Criteo, these algorithms create similar audiences, or groups of consumers likely to be interested in and engage with a specific category of our clients’ products or services, from a pre-determined audience seed based on other clients’ audiences that were already targeted and exposed to similar products or services in the context of previous advertising campaigns. Once created, these similar audiences are used by Criteo AI Engine as targets to reach and be exposed to tailored ads for relevant products or services for the purpose of a dedicated campaign. This new set of algorithms typically supports campaign types addressing Consideration advertising objectives, i.e. driving new prospects to consider products or services with which they have not engaged in the past. 


• | Recommendation algorithms. These algorithms create advertisements tailored to specific consumer interest and intent by determining the specific products and services to include in the ad. These products and services may be ones that the consumer has already been exposed to, or that the algorithms predict the customer could be interested in. Alternatively, these may be products and services that other consumers within Criteo Shopper Graph exposed to some of the same products and services, have been interested in.


• | Dynamic Creative Optimization+. Based on the results of our algorithms, Criteo AI Engine automatically and dynamically assembles customized creative advertising content on an impression-per-impression basis in real time, by optimizing each individual creative component in the advertisement, from the font, color, size and format of product images to the "call to action" or price discount. Our patented Dynamic Creative Optimization+ technology offers virtually unlimited personalization, with up to 17 trillion visual ad variations, without the need to define advertisement sizes or layouts upfront, while maintaining the consistency of our clients' brand image.

5


• | Predictive bidding algorithms. These algorithms predict the probability and nature of a user's engagement with a given advertisement. Such predicted user engagement can take the form, for example, of retailer site visits, clicks, conversions, shopping basket value, specific product categories purchased, or even the gross margin of the purchased product or service that our client generates from such purchase. This prediction of engagement incorporates data from our clients, publishers and third-party sources, including user intent, who the client is, the products offered by the client, as well as data on the creative content of the ad and the publisher context in which the ad is viewed.

Together with our recommendation algorithms, the prediction algorithms allow us to determine the most appropriate price to pay for an advertising impression, based on an individual user's predicted engagement, what the client is willing to pay for that engagement, as well as Criteo's own target Revenue ex-TAC margin from placing the ad. Our bidding engine executes campaigns based on certain objectives set by our clients (such as cost-per-click, cost-per-order, cost-of-sales, cost-per-visit, cost-per-impression, cost-per-install or total budget goal). After a bid for an advertising impression is placed and won, Criteo AI Engine assembles and delivers individualized ads, and provides campaign reporting in near-real time.

• | Software systems and processes. Our algorithms are supported by robust software infrastructure that allows us to operate seamlessly at a very large scale (through over 36,000 servers by the end of 2018). The architecture and processing capabilities of this technology have been designed to match the massive computational demands and complexity of our algorithms in real time. This technology enables data synchronization, storage and analysis across a large-scale distributed computing infrastructure in multiple geographies, as well as fast data collection and retrieval using multi-layered caching infrastructure.


• | Experimentation platform. This online/offline platform is used to improve the capabilities and effectiveness of our prediction models by measuring the correlation of specific parameters with user engagement, usually measured by consumer visits, clicks and conversions, typically in the form of sales. A dedicated team is constantly testing new types and sources of data, as well as new variables, to determine whether they help diminish the gap between, for example, predicted visits, click-throughs and conversions, and actual visits, click-throughs and conversions over the course of a live campaign.

A key attribute of Criteo AI Engine is the vast metadata of learnings on advertising and commerce effectiveness that we have accumulated from having delivered and measured responses to over 6.0 trillion advertising impressions since inception. Our Research & Development team constantly tunes Criteo AI Engine via experimentation and A/B tests. In 2018, about 700 online A/B tests and 20,000 offline experiments and tests were performed.
In addition, we have long established Privacy-by-design as a central element of our technology and product design and development, with a strong commitment to ensuring best practices in privacy, security and safety for consumers and our commerce and consumer brand clients. Since 2013, we have had a designated Data Privacy Officer along with a team of privacy experts. These experts are deeply integrated within our R&D and Product organization and processes, and consider all facets of user privacy as key elements in the design of any new solution or feature of our Advertising Platform. They also perform ongoing Privacy Impact Assessments to monitor potential risks during the product lifecycle and proactively mitigate those risks. The Data Privacy team delivers company-wide privacy training, enforces our privacy policies and is integral to ensuring that we build the best solutions and services. We regularly review and document our internal privacy policies, amend existing policies as necessary and enforce these policies with our clients, publisher partners and vendors.
Criteo Management Center
We offer our advertiser clients an integrated and modular customer platform that provides control, visibility and detailed transparency on their campaigns, whatever their business and marketing goals may be. This platform provides a unified and easy-to-use self-service user interface ("UI") enabling the flexible and modular consumption of our various solutions by our clients, as well as the execution and management of their campaigns through a suite of software and services that automates key campaign processes. As a result, our clients benefit from a high level of control over the objectives, components and performance of their various campaigns with us. Our customer platform also reduces unnecessary complexity and cost associated with manual processes of having to use multiple Demand-Side Platforms ("DSPs") and sources of inventory supply, delivering efficiencies across the consumer journey, even as campaigns grow in size, complexity and mix of marketing goals.
We believe that transparency and control over the objectives, modular components and performance of their advertising campaigns increases the confidence our clients have in Criteo, and further strengthens our relationship with them.
Our customer platform includes a comprehensive suite of tools, services and software, including:

• | A unified self-service user interface to transparently manage campaigns, solution by solution. This self-service interface automates a number of modular components, campaign execution and management tasks. Key attributes of the interface include:


▪ | an easy-to-use user interface;


▪ | self-service tools to consume, on demand, specific modules of the campaigns, including for example: specific audiences to reach and target, specific creative or branding elements to include in ads, specific categories of supply to favor or exclude from the campaign, specific categories of the product catalog to promote in the campaign, specific coupon and price discount management


▪ | granular control, with the ability to specify, for each campaign, the price that the client is ready to pay (on either a cost-per-click, cost-per-impression or cost-per-install basis, at its own product category level);


▪ | transparent and detailed reporting of key campaign metrics, such as cost-per-click, cost-per-impression or cost-per-install, impressions served, effective cost per thousand impressions, or eCPM, consumer visits, app installations, click-through rate and post-click sales; and 


▪ | transparent standardized reports on purchased inventory showing detailed impression-level information, including publisher domains where ads are shown, time stamps of displayed ads and the value of each impression.


• | Business intelligence and analytics. Included in our service for our larger clients, we provide high-value consulting services through a team of advisers that aid them in setting goals for, extracting insights from, and evaluating trends and performance of their various advertising campaigns across multiple marketing goals, sources of inventory supply, advertising channels, and the multiple digital devices that customers may use.

In parallel with accessing transparent reporting from the Criteo Management Center, a large proportion of our clients regularly use their own attribution tools and solutions (such as, for example, Google Analytics, IBM Coremetrics or Adobe Analytics) to independently measure and assess the performance of the results delivered by Criteo, including sales.
Our Solutions
We offer two families of solutions targeted to our commerce and consumer brand clients:

• | Criteo Marketing Solutions allow commerce companies to address multiple marketing goals by engaging their consumers with personalized ads across the web, mobile and offline store environments. Examples of expected results for clients using Criteo Marketing Solutions include:


◦ | driving visits from new prospects on the website of our clients by engaging such prospects, either in the web or on mobile apps, with personalized ads offering products or services that are tailored to their predicted interest (Consideration goal, new visit objective);

7


◦ | driving installations of our clients' mobile application by new customers, by engaging such new customers, either in the web or on mobile apps, with personalized ads promoting our client's mobile application (Consideration goal, app install objective);


◦ | driving sales for our commerce clients, either on their web or mobile app property, by engaging consumers, either in the web or on mobile apps, with personalized ads offering products or services for which they have already expressed shopping intent (Conversion goal, sales objective);


◦ | driving more sales from existing customers for our commerce clients, either on their web or mobile application property, by accurately targeting and re-engaging such existing customers, either in the web or on mobile apps, with personalized ads offering new products or services that they have not yet purchased (Conversion goal, re-engagement sales objective).


• | Criteo Retail Media allows retailers to generate advertising revenues from consumer brands, and/or to drive sales for themselves, by monetizing their traffic and audiences through personalized ads, either on their own digital property or on the open Internet, that address multiple marketing goals. Examples of expected results for clients using Criteo Retail Media solutions include:


◦ | generating advertising revenue for retailers on their online store, by providing retailers with our technology platform for them to monetize their traffic and audiences directly with consumer brands across various marketing goals (Monetization goal, onsite advertising objective);


◦ | driving sales for consumer brand clients on the site of retailer partners, by connecting consumer brands and retailers and engaging consumers on the retailer's digital property with personalized ads offering specific brand products available on the retailer's digital property and for which consumers have expressed interest (Conversion goal, onsite campaign, sales objective);


◦ | driving sales for consumer brand clients on the site of retailer partners, by connecting consumer brands and retailers and engaging consumers outside of the retailer property on the open Internet with personalized ads offering specific brand products available on the retailer's digital property and for which consumers have expressed interest (Conversion goal, offsite campaign, sales objective);

While our current solutions already allow our clients to cover a large part of the consumer journey, through Consideration and Conversion marketing goals, we intend to develop solutions to address the Awareness marketing goal in the future, and therefore cover the entire consumer journey for clients. 
Historically, the Criteo model had focused solely on converting our clients' website visitors into customers, enabling us to charge our clients only when users engage with an ad we deliver, usually by clicking on it. This pay-for-performance pricing model clearly links the cost of an advertising campaign to its effectiveness in driving conversions, and has been valued as such by our clients. As we have expanded our solutions to address a broader range of marketing and monetization goals, we also started expanding our pricing models to now include a combination of cost-per-install and cost-per-impression for selected new solutions, in addition to cost-per-click, as well as subscription-type pricing model for large retailers using our technology platform as part of of our Criteo Retail Media offering. In the future, we may further evolve the pricing of our solutions.
Excluding our historical solution for driving Conversion through Criteo Marketing Solutions (formerly called Criteo Dynamic Retargeting), no individual solution accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated revenue for the periods presented.
Our Publisher Network
We provide extensive real-time access to advertising inventory to our advertiser clients through real-time bidding, or "RTB," Display Advertising exchanges, as well as direct relationships with thousands of publisher partners. We define inventory as the combination of desktop web, mobile web and mobile in-app Display Advertising impressions, including social display inventory, native display inventory, video inventory, and inventory for advertisements on major retail ecommerce properties, including for sponsored product formats. 
8

In some cases, we have negotiated direct and privileged access with publishers, giving us the opportunity to select, buy and price, on an impression-per-impression basis and in real time: (1) inventory that a publisher might otherwise only sell subject to minimum volume commitments; and/or (2) particular advertising impressions before such impressions are made available to other potential buyers. 
We believe that many of our direct publisher partners have granted us preferred access to portions of their inventory as a result of our ability to effectively monetize that inventory. For example, in Japan, we have entered into a strategic relationship with Yahoo! Japan, that grants us privileged access to its advertising inventory for delivering personalized display ads. Within Criteo Retail Media, we access inventory from ecommerce sites that is generally not available to traditional advertising demand. This inventory from ecommerce retailers is particularly valuable for consumer brands looking to advertise their products with a Consideration or Conversion marketing goal in a multi-brand retail environment.
We price and buy inventory in real time and typically do not pre-buy any impression, and do not commit to buying any minimum volume of impressions, except in some limited cases related to one Criteo Retail Media solution. Across both our direct publisher relationships and inventory purchasing done on RTB exchanges, we leverage Criteo AI Engine's ability to quickly and accurately value available advertising inventory, and utilize that information to bid for inventory on a programmatic, automated basis. 
Alongside our existing technologies to integrate directly with publishers, we have developed Criteo Direct Bidder, our header-bidding technology. Over the past few years, the publisher landscape has rapidly transitioned towards header-bidding technology, allowing publishers to make their inventory simultaneously available for public auction to several competitive bidders, including RTB exchanges. Thanks to our large scale, Criteo Direct Bidder allows us to connect directly to the ad server of publishers in situations where publishers use header bidding to monetize their inventory, allowing us to bypass RTB exchanges in the bidding process. Using Criteo Direct Bidder, we were connected to close to 3,500 large publishers globally as of December 31, 2018, including NBC, The Weather Channel, Washington Post, Daily Mail, The Washington Post, eBay, AJA Japan, Orange, Viber, the LA Times, CBS, Fox News, Axel Springer's websites, Marktplaats and M6. Criteo Direct Bidder has been positively received by publishers, helping them to increase the average monetization of their inventory sold through Criteo Direct Bidder, relative to our overall spend through all channels.
For Criteo Marketing Solutions, we purchase inventory programmatically on a CPM basis (or cost-per-thousand-impressions) from our direct publisher partners and RTBs, through standard terms and conditions for the purchase of Display Advertising inventory. This means that inventory purchased for Criteo Marketing Solutions is paid to the publisher irrespective of whether the user engages with the advertisement delivered on that publisher's digital property. Pursuant to such arrangements, we purchase impressions for users that Criteo recognizes on the publishers' digital properties. Such arrangements are cancellable upon short notice and without penalty. 
For some of our Criteo Retail Media solutions, we pay for the inventory of the retailer publishers based on a revenue share, effectively paying the retailer publisher a portion of the click-based revenue generated by customers clicking on the advertisements displaying the products of our consumer brand clients. This means that, with these Criteo Retail Media solutions, retailer publishers only get paid if a user effectively clicks on the advertisement that is displayed on their site. For our remaining Criteo Retail Media solutions, we either buy inventory on a CPM basis or do not incur media buying at all as, in such cases, we solely provide access to our technology to retailers for them to sell their inventory directly to consumer brands.
We believe that our ability to efficiently access and value inventory at scale results in a deeply liquid marketplace for both buyers and sellers of Display Advertising, allowing us to deliver effective ads at the right price for our clients, even as the size and complexity of the campaign increases.
In addition to buying advertising inventory at scale, we take a variety of brand safety measures to ensure that the brand equity of our clients is preserved. These measures include determining that each publisher's inventory meets our content requirements and those of our clients to ensure that their display advertisements are not shown in inappropriate content categories, such as in adult, violent or sensitive political content. For that purpose, we use numerous internal systems and processes to filter out inventory in real time, including the list of suspect IP addresses from the Trustworthy Accountability Group and the lists of invalid traffic from several specialized external vendors. With respect to inventory purchased through RTB exchanges, we utilize a mix of proprietary methodologies as well as third-party software to verify that inventory where the ad is shown conforms to our advertising guidelines and the content expectations and branding guidelines of our clients. In addition, we are an active member of the Coalition for Better Ads, supported by Google, and are compliant with their recommendations for the most user-friendly advertising formats.

Industry Background
The ability to engage customers across the various steps of the consumer journey is critical for most companies, especially for businesses in the broader commerce and consumer brand sectors, who often dedicate a significant portion of their cost base to developing such an ability. 
Ecommerce Continues to Grow Fast But Retailers Face Increasing Competition.
While the global retail commerce market, at $24 trillion in 2018 according to eMarketer, is massive in size, the global retail ecommerce market represented only $3 trillion of that amount. This means that, despite the rapid growth of ecommerce, physical stores still capture more than 80% of the global retail commerce market and remain key assets for retail companies looking to offer differentiated services and shopping experiences to consumers, while selling their products. Further, the global retail ecommerce market is expected to grow by a 20% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, to $6 trillion in 2022, according to eMarketer.
Retailers and consumer brands are facing increasing competition, in particular in markets dominated by Amazon, and have started to respond by being increasingly willing to share data within collectives. We believe that consumer brands and retailers not only realize the strong potential of their commerce data, but also increasingly view collaboration and pooled data as key assets that can be used to better meet customer needs, drive value for their business and better compete in today's environment. According to a study published by Forbes Insights in collaboration with Criteo in October 2017, 71% of retailers are willing to contribute online product searches data to a pool1. Sixty percent of surveyed retailers are already part of a data cooperative, with almost 70% of those companies already pleased with their collaboration as well as the data they receive. Additionally, 72% of marketers cite "increased revenue" as a key benefit they experience from pooled data.
Digital Ad Spending Continues to Grow Fast.
The display advertising market represents a large opportunity. Global digital ad spending of $261 billion in 2018 was comprised of Search Advertising ($123 billion) and Display Advertising ($138 billion), according to eMarketer. Display Advertising involves placing images, video or advertisements that incorporate animation, sound and/or interactivity, alongside website and mobile application content. Display Advertising is expected to grow by a 14% CAGR through 2022 to reach $236 billion, faster than Search Advertising and driven in part by the rapid rise of mobile Internet usage and the continued proliferation of free content across the Internet, in particular video content, including on social media platforms.
The walled-gardens, in particular Google and Facebook, today capture a significant share of the growth of the digital market. As a result, we believe that they capture approximately 70% of the total digital ad spend while representing only half of the time spent online2. This means that the open Internet, (i.e. what is outside of walled-gardens), only captures approximately 30% of the ad spend despite accounting for 50% of user time spend and, we believe, is therefore significantly under-monetized. We define the open Internet as the open, non-proprietary environment that allows advertisers and publishers to choose the partner they want to work with, decide when and how they share data, and control how to measure success. 
Advertising Technology is Becoming More Complex.
Display Advertising has become highly technology-driven, which comes with significant challenges:
Programmatic Buying. Technologies for more automated and efficient buying and selling of Display Advertising have been gaining traction for several years with both advertising buyers and publishers. Programmatic buying from real-time, automated bidding platforms and exchanges, as well as through relationships with publishers, provides advertisers with dynamic, targeted and efficient ways to access the proper inventory, and helps publishers maximize the value of their inventory. In the United States, programmatic digital display ad spending represents 83% of total Display Advertising spend, according to eMarketer.
Mobile and Cross-Device Commerce. Penetration of smartphones and tablets is driving rapid growth of global mobile commerce. Mobile retail commerce represented $1.8 trillion globally in 2018, and is expected to grow at a 25% CAGR between 2018 and 2022, according to eMarketer. In parallel, consumers increasingly use multiple devices to shop across ecommerce websites and mobile applications. As a result, we believe that transactions involving the use of multiple devices, referred to as "cross-device" transactions, represent a significant portion of ecommerce, growing faster than ecommerce overall.

In-App Advertising. The app environment is more complex than the web environment for advertising. However, users spend most of their mobile time within apps (77% in the United States in 2018, according to eMarketer). Consequently, in-app ad spending represents 81% of mobile ad spending in 2018 in the United States. In this context, it is critical for advertisers to be able to effectively reach their consumers while they are in the app environment.
Artificial Intelligence. According to IDC Research, from now until 2020, the digital information universe is expected to double in size every two years. The large and diverse data sets that make up this digital information, often referred to as big data, are generally categorized into: business application data, human-generated content and machine data. New computational approaches and the falling costs of computing power enable technology companies to process and draw insights from this data using AI and machine-learning approaches. These insights can be used to optimize Display Advertising campaigns in ways that were not previously possible. The ability to collect, collate and analyze shopping intent data points using AI and machine-learning technology, has become a key differentiator for advertisers, including consumer brands.
Advertisers Need a Neutral Strategic Partner to Navigate This Complex and Challenging Environment.
We believe that over the past few years, Display Advertising has reached an inflection point, becoming both a brand awareness building medium and a more effective engagement channel for multiple marketing goals, including customer conversion. 
In today's highly competitive environment, commerce companies and consumer brands increasingly focus on profitably reaching, engaging and converting consumers. In addition, we believe they increasingly look at diversifying their significant reliance on walled-garden advertising partners. To achieve this, they need a strategic partner, with no conflicting business agenda, able to activate large amounts of consumer intent and identification data into actionable advertising objectives through AI technology to drive measurable results at scale across all marketing goals.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe our offering is transforming the way our commerce and consumer brand clients use digital advertising. We make their advertising investments, in particular in Digital Advertising across the open Internet, more efficient, effective and measurable by driving impactful results across multiple marketing goals. We believe the following competitive strengths have enabled us and will continue to enable us to capture a growing share of the digital advertising opportunity:
Criteo Shopper Graph Leverages a Massive, Granular and Open Data Set Focused on Shopping Behaviors. Over the past few years, we have built Criteo Shopper Graph, comprising the Identity Graph, the Interest Map and the Measurement Network, through data sharing among our clients. With Criteo Shopper Graph, we are building one of the largest data sets focused on shoppers, with a scope among the largest in the industry. With 73% of our clients providing CRM data to enable us to gather over 4 billion user IDs across multiple digital devices or environments in our graph, we believe the matching rates of our Identity Graph are, in some markets, similar to, if not higher than, Google's and Facebook's. In addition, our Interest Map offers a comprehensive, accurate and non-identifying shopper profile for all consumers on whom we have collected information, and is the foundation for the development of compelling solutions -existing and new- that help our clients span the consumer journey. Importantly, we believe the guiding principles of Criteo Shopper Graph, in particular its open, transparent and fair approach to sharing and leveraging data within collectives, highly differentiate it from the proprietary data management approaches of most of the large Internet companies.
Our Powerful Technology Activates Our Datasets for Effective Advertising. While shopping data is readily available in significant volumes to our commerce and consumer brand clients, and plays a critical role for them, we believe the real challenge in driving effective advertising is the ability to effectively activate this dataset to drive impactful results for advertisers. Our advertising platform is the result of 13 years of research and development and investment in our AI technology, with a single focus on driving measurable business results, including sales, for clients. Through our deep data-driven understanding of consumer intent and behavior, we are able to deliver highly relevant, targeted and personalized ads across multiple marketing goals and digital devices. The scale and breadth of our data is constantly expanding as users interact with our clients and as we deliver targeted ads. For example, in 2018, we delivered over 1.3 trillion targeted ads. 
By dynamically matching a user's intent or interest with a personalized ad, we are able to deliver more relevant and engaging ads to users, which are more likely to achieve targeted results for advertisers.

Criteo AI Engine is supported by a flexible and scalable high-performance computing infrastructure, made of two Hadoop clusters hosting 76,000 processing cores with total storage capacity of 240,000 terabytes and 530 terabytes of random-access memory. Every day, our platform processes 250 terabytes of additional compressed data. We own approximately over 36,000 servers through a global network of nine data centers. We believe the power and scalability of our AI technology assets are increasingly hard to replicate by other market participants. 
Our Large Scale Drives Powerful Network Effects. Our technology, developed and maintained by about 700 R&D and Product engineers, operates at significant scale and is powered by AI and machine-learning algorithms whose accuracy and performance improve with each new piece of information about a user and the billions of advertising impressions we analyze daily. We believe this creates a cycle of significant network effects. Over the past 13 years, we have built an extensive network of relationships with our clients and publishers, creating a highly liquid marketplace for advertising inventory. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 19,000 clients, including some of the largest commerce companies in the world. As we continue to grow our client base, we continue to grow the number of users who interact with our ads, which allows us to benefit from greater scale when we purchase inventory from publisher partners, many of whom have granted us preferred access to portions of their advertising inventory. On the supply side, we have direct relationships with thousands of publisher partners and are integrated with the leading RTB advertising exchanges. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 4 billion user IDs, with an estimated average of three user IDs matched per user, within our Identity Graph globally, making it one of the largest user graphs in the market. As clients spend more with us and we attract more publisher inventory and deliver more ads, our data assets grow, enabling us to deliver even more precisely targeted and personalized ads and generate a greater impact for our clients. For consumer brands, we have also created a strong network effect with our Criteo Retail Media solutions by offering them the opportunity to advertise on a large network of retailers with a variety of marketing goals. As a result, we believe more commerce and consumer brand clients will use our offering and potentially increase their spend with us. This, in turn, will enable us to increase advertising revenue for publishers, including retailers, further expanding our publisher network and enhancing our ability to drive better performance for clients. We expect this cycle of self-reinforcing network effects to continue to fuel our growth. 
Our Client-Centric Offering Provides a Complete Suite of Advertising Solutions. We believe our solutions address a broad range of our clients' needs: covering a large part of the consumer journey with their advertising spend, as well as, for retailers, effectively monetizing their traffic and audiences to generate advertising revenue at scale. Our offering works seamlessly across digital devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets), commerce and advertising environments (web, mobile applications and offline stores), platforms and operating systems, advertising channels (Display Advertising inventory, including social and native, video inventory, and advertisements on retail ecommerce properties), and publisher environments (Google Ad Manager, thousands of publishers and mobile application developers in the open Internet, and Facebook). With the fast growth in smartphone and tablet usage making the path to purchase increasingly fragmented, it has become critical for marketers to address multiple marketing goals, and reach and engage their consumers across multiple digital devices. We believe that, for advertisers looking to engage their prospects or existing customers, irrespective of their position in the consumer journey, their digital device, commerce or advertising environment, platform and operating system, advertising channel or publisher environment where consumers may be reached and engaged, our complete suite of solutions provides a clear advantage over the many point solutions available on the market. 
We Price and Measure Our Solutions On a Variety of Models. While the Criteo model has historically focused solely on converting our clients' website visitors into customers, linking our proven pay-for-performance model to its effectiveness in driving sales for clients, we have more recently evolved our pricing models alongside our broader suite of solutions, to now include a combination of cost-per-install and cost-per-impression for selected new solutions, in addition to cost-per-click, as well as subscription-type pricing model for large retailers using our technology platform as part of of our Criteo Retail Media offering. As Criteo AI Engine becomes more sophisticated, we are optimizing our technology to maximize a wider range of expected advertising objectives, including, for example, customer visits, installations of mobile apps and sales, each of them at a target return on investment for clients. We believe our clients value our pricing models and related measurement metrics, as they provide a clear link between the cost of their advertising campaigns and their effectiveness in generating impactful and measurable results for them. We believe our new range of pricing models fits our clients' multiple marketing goals and is a key competitive advantage in the market.
Our Solutions Cover the Consumer Journey. With our current families of solutions, Criteo Marketing Solutions and Criteo Retail Media, we help our clients cover the consumer journey, and in particular drive Consideration and Conversion for their products and services, as consumers travel across the multiple steps of the consumer journey. We continue to build and develop new solutions to help commerce and consumer brand clients address additional marketing goals and drive new business outcomes, including, for example, brand Awareness. We believe our ability to drive impactful results for multiple marketing goals across the consumer journey is a key competitive advantage on the market.
12

We Have a Scaled Global Presence. We do business in 98 countries and have a direct operating presence through 31 offices in 19 countries. In 2018, 42% of our revenue1 was derived from clients who conducted advertising campaigns with us in more than one national market. We have achieved this global presence by replicating and scaling our powerful business model across all geographic markets. Large businesses are increasingly seeking global advertising partners with comprehensive offerings that are effective across multiple geographies. We believe we are able to meet this demand by leveraging our scalable AI technology and global network of relationships and are well positioned to serve our clients in virtually every market in which they seek to drive impactful and measurable business results.
Our Self-Service Platform Offers End-To-End Services, Flexible Campaign Management and Transparent Measurement. Our offering is end-to-end and all-inclusive, encompassing the integration of our clients' digital properties, user reach and tracking, the real-time buying of impressions on a large network of publishers, the real-time creation of customized ads for each specific client and its prospective end customer, the serving and delivery of the ads and the provision of real-time analytics on the performance of our campaigns. Our clients have 24/7 access to our self-service platform providing a set of automated tools allowing clients to monitor and control the objectives, modular components and performance of their advertising campaigns. Clients can access and control, on demand, a wide range of specific modules of their campaigns, such as for example: specific audiences to reach and target, specific creative or branding elements to include in ads, specific categories of supply to favor or exclude from the campaign, specific categories of the product catalog to promote in the campaign, specific coupon and price discount management. 
In addition, our unified user interface allows our clients to manage their spend, solution by solution, and campaign by campaign. Our platform automates most of the processes associated with executing an advertising campaign, such as creative assembly, real-time buying of inventory, campaign optimization, and billing. Using our platform, our clients are able to manage their campaigns based on their specific cost of sales or return on investment objectives on large volumes, with real-time control over the price they pay. As a result, we reduce unnecessary complexity and cost associated with manual processes and multiple providers involved in the management of multi-solution advertising campaigns. Further, we are able to continue to deliver these efficiencies even as advertising campaigns scale and become more complex in size and mix of marketing goals. We also provide our clients with transparent and detailed reporting of key campaign metrics, and transparent standard reports showing detailed impression-level information. We believe the control, modularity, ease of use and transparency that our self-service platform provides is a key strength on the market.
We Apply Best-In-Class User Privacy Standards. We are strongly committed to consumer privacy. We have long established Privacy-by-design as a central element of our technology and product design and development, with a strong commitment to ensuring best practices in privacy, security and safety for consumers and our commerce and consumer brand clients. Since 2013, we have had a designated Data Privacy Officer along with a team of privacy experts. These experts are deeply integrated within our R&D and Product organization and processes, and consider all facets of user privacy as key elements in the design of any new technology, feature or service. Aligning with data minimization principles our technologies only rely on categories of data that are strictly necessary for the purpose of our services. The user information we collect relates primarily to purchase intent and is therefore not considered as information that can directly identify a user. In 2009, we were one of the first companies to include an "Ad Choices" link in all the ads we deliver, giving users access to clear, transparent, detailed and user-friendly information about personalized ads and the data practices associated with the ads they receive. In addition, we provide consumers with an easy-to-use and easy-to-access mechanism to control their advertising experience and opt out of receiving targeted ads we deliver, either for all campaigns or for a specific client or a specific period of time.
We believe that this transparent, consumer-centric, and controllable approach to privacy empowers consumers to make better-informed decisions about our use of their data. We also actively encourage our clients and publishers to provide information to consumers about our collection and use of data relating to the ads we deliver and monitor. We believe our industry-leading privacy, security and safety standards for consumers and our commerce and consumer brand clients are key competitive advantages on the market.
Our Growth Opportunities 
Our vision is to build the leading Advertising Platform for the Open Internet, by enabling commerce companies and consumer brands to address multiple marketing goals across the open Internet by using our modular and flexible Advertising Platform. Our goal is to make advertising work by driving impactful results at scale for our clients at their targeted return on investment and across the entire consumer journey. We are currently expanding our business and strengthening our Advertising Platform through several growth opportunities, both within our existing solutions and in new areas, always focused on driving measurable results for clients. The core elements of our growth strategy include:
1 Excluding Criteo Retail Media.

Further Build and Leverage the Criteo Shopper Graph. Since 2015, we have developed Criteo Shopper Graph, which comprises the Identity Graph, the Interest Map and the Measurement Network, through data pooling among our clients. With Criteo Shopper Graph, we are building one the world's largest data sets focused on shoppers, that offers our clients openness, transparency, security and fairness. Criteo Shopper Graph, in particular the Identity Graph and the Interest Map, is central to our approach of the open Internet and our plans to bring compelling new advertising solutions to market. We will continue to build and enhance the data collectives that make up Criteo Shopper Graph.
Continue to Innovate and Invest in our Technology Platform and Data. We will continue to make substantial investments in research and development, in particular in Deep Learning, to further strengthen Criteo AI Engine and to scale our technology platform, with a particular focus on making our self-service Advertising Platform more modular and flexible for clients. As the rich data sets that drive performance on a real-time basis are central to our offering, we intend to invest in additional data assets, including from third-party vendors, to extract more value from the data we collect. We are also investing in adapting our technology to make it more robust to decisions of web browser vendors and to further diversify our data collection away from relying on third-party cookies.
Upsell New Solutions Across the Consumer Journey. Our current families of solutions, comprised of Criteo Marketing Solutions and Criteo Retail Media, help our clients cover a large part of the consumer journey, by driving Consideration and Conversion for their products and services across all commerce environments, and generating advertising revenues for retailers through the monetization of their data and audiences with brands. Since our existing solutions address the needs of commerce clients, in particular retailers, we intend to continue to upsell them to more or all of our solutions within Criteo Marketing Solutions. And since many of our commerce clients are ecommerce retailers with their own digital properties, we intend to continue to offer Criteo Retail Media as a key advertising channel for them to generate high gross margin revenue from consumer brands. 
Broaden Quality Inventory Supply With a Focus on Mobile Apps and Video. We currently partner with thousands of media publishers globally for Display Advertising, including both real-time bidding Display Advertising exchanges and direct publishers, including premium publishers. While 35% of the yield we generated to publisher partners in 2018 was derived from inventory sourced from publishers with whom we have a direct, preferred relationship, we intend to maintain a high level of preferred relationships, including through the broader deployment of Criteo Direct Bidder with large publishers. To leverage the fast growth of user time spent in mobile apps, we continue to expand our supply of quality advertising inventory in mobile apps with a particular focus on direct premium app publishers. In addition, to support the growth of our solutions for Consideration - aimed at driving new visitors or prospects for clients -, we will look at expanding our access to video inventory, both in the web and in mobile applications. With Criteo Retail Media, we intend to increase our publisher reach with retailers by providing a broader share of our existing retailer partners with the opportunity to monetize their inventory through consumer brand demand. 
Further Expand our Global Client Base Across Sizes. We have a track-record of entering new geographic markets, adding new clients successfully and rapidly gaining commercial traction. We intend to continue to grow our client base, both in the large client and the midmarket categories. Over several years, we have significantly invested to capture the midmarket opportunity and intend to further invest in this large market category. We plan to expand our midmarket presence in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia-Pacific. We believe significant opportunities also remain to grow our business with large clients in geographic markets where we already operate, such as Western Europe, the United States and Japan. 
In 2018, we started to undertake a transformation of our go-to-market model, aimed at maximizing the commercial opportunity for our multi-solution offering, by providing the right level of services to each of our client segments - based on their size and business potential with us -, and by scaling our midmarket operations more efficiently and profitably. This includes the roll out of the onboarding module of our self-service platform, supported by appropriate sales and marketing services and channels, to enable large volumes of lower segments of midmarket clients to sign up and be self-served in a more automated, scalable and profitable way. 
Criteo primarily delivers advertising for companies in the retail, travel and classifieds verticals, which we define as commerce clients. With Criteo Retail Media, we also address the need for measurable advertising of brand manufacturers, who can market their products on major retail ecommerce properties. We believe the demand for effective and measurable advertising from brand manufacturers represents a large opportunity for us. We will continue to focus on growing our share of brand manufacturers through the expansion of our Criteo Retail Media solutions to a larger number of retail ecommerce sites.
14

Develop New Products for Commerce and Consumer Brand Clients. In 2007, we started delivering elements of our historical Conversion solution on internet display ads in desktop browsers. Since then, we have expanded our historical offering into mobile in-browser, in-app, and native display, including on social media platforms. In parallel, we have broadened our solutions to include Consideration solutions for commerce companies across web, apps and stores, as well as solutions for retailers to monetize their data and audiences through advertising revenues from consumer brands. For example, we have recently expanded into "look-alike" audience targeting for commerce clients, into mobile apps installation for commerce clients, and into performance-based campaigns for consumer brands outside of the retailer environment. To enable our clients to further expand their reach inside the consumer journey, we intend to invest in developing new solutions, including for the Awareness marketing goal. 
Grow our Omnichannel Capabilities. A large portion of our commerce client base operates physical stores and still generates a significant percentage of their sales from offline stores. While retailers extract massive amounts of sales data from their physical stores, they often lack the sophisticated technology necessary to activate this dataset for sales generation, both online and offline. As a result, retailers are increasingly interested in omnichannel advertising solutions that allow them to target their customers everywhere and, doing so, bridge the gap between online and offline. We are expanding our solutions for omnichannel advertising, by feeding our clients' offline CRM data into our Identity Graph, in order to match offline consumers with their online profile. For example, within Criteo Marketing Solutions, our feature for customer re-engagement (formerly known as Criteo Audience Match) allows the uploading of online and offline CRM identifiers, like hashed emails, to inform and run online campaigns targeted at existing customers for them to buy new products online. We are also working on Store-to-web Conversion campaigns to reengage offline buyers to buy more, both online and offline. 
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We acquired eight companies since our inception. We selectively evaluate technologies and businesses that we believe have potential to enhance, complement or expand our technology platform and solutions, or strengthen our research and development team. We target acquisitions that can be efficiently integrated into our AI technology, Advertising Platform, global operations and company culture, while preserving the quality and performance of our offering. We believe we are an acquirer of choice among prospective acquisition targets thanks to our entrepreneurial culture, growth opportunity, global scale, strong brand and market position. We intend to opportunistically pursue our acquisition strategy in the future.
Strategic Relationship with Yahoo! Japan
In August 2012, we entered into a strategic relationship with Yahoo! Japan, a leading provider of advertising inventory in Japan, which grants us privileged access to their performance-based display inventory. In connection with this strategic relationship, Yahoo! Japan invested in our subsidiary, Criteo K.K. We retain 66% ownership of Criteo K.K. and Yahoo! Japan holds a 34% ownership. Yahoo! Japan has the right to require us to buy back its interest upon the occurrence of certain events (such as bankruptcy or breach of obligations), and we have the right to require them to sell their interest in Criteo K.K. under specified circumstances, such as a termination of the commercial relationship. 
This strategic relationship may be terminated by either party for material breach and other customary events. The term of this strategic relationship automatically renewed to August 2019 and will continue to renew automatically thereafter for one-year terms if neither party provides advance written notice of its intent not to renew within a specified period of time. 
Infrastructure
Our ability to execute depends on our highly sophisticated global technology software and hardware infrastructure. As of December 31, 2018, our global infrastructure included over 36,000 servers, including two Hadoop clusters, that comprise 3,350 servers providing a storage capacity exceeding 240,000 terabytes and 530 terabytes of random-access memory. Our global infrastructure is divided into three independent geographic zones in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA. In each of these zones, our services are delivered through data centers that support this zone. We generally rely on more than one data center in any given zone. Within large zones, the data centers are strategically placed to be close to our clients, publishers and users. This provides the benefit of minimizing the impact of network latency within a particular zone, especially for time-constrained services such as RTB. In addition, we replicate data across multiple data centers to maximize availability and performance. We also generally seek to distribute workload across multiple locations to avoid overloads in our systems and increase reliability through redundancy.
15

Within each data center, computing power is provided by horizontal build-outs of commodity servers arranged in multiple, highly redundant pools. Some of these pools are dedicated to handling incoming traffic and delivering ads while others are devoted to the data analytics involved in creating these ads. In particular, we use software specifically designed for processing large data sets, such as Hadoop, to run offline data analyzes and to train our AI and Machine Learning models. The results are then fed back to refresh and improve our prediction and recommendation algorithms.
We use multiple-layered security controls to protect Criteo AI Engine and our data assets, including hardware- and software-based access controls for our source code and production systems, segregated networks for different components of our production systems and centralized production systems management.
Our Clients 
Our client base consists primarily of companies in the retail, travel and classifieds verticals, which we refer to as "commerce companies" or "commerce clients", and includes some of the largest and most sophisticated commerce companies in the world. These companies range from large, global, diversified commerce companies to mid-sized regional companies.
With Criteo Retail Media, we also serve consumer brand manufacturers, which we refer to as "consumer brands" or "consumer brand clients". As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 19,000 clients (commerce and consumer brand clients combined). In 2018, approximately 75% of our client relationships1 were held directly with the client, whereby there was no advertising agency or any other third-party involved in our client relationship. 
We believe our business is not substantially dependent on any particular client or group of clients. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, our largest client represented 2.0%, 1.9% and 2.0% of our revenue, respectively, and in 2018 our largest 10 clients represented 11.7% of our revenue in the aggregate. 
There is no group of customers under common control or customers that are affiliates of each other constituting an aggregate amount equal to 10% or more of our consolidated revenues, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
We define a client to be a unique party from whom we have received an insertion order and delivered an advertisement during the previous 12 months. We count specific brands or divisions within the same business as distinct clients so long as those entities have separately signed insertion orders with us. On the other hand, we count a client who runs campaigns in multiple geographies as a single client, even though multiple insertion orders may be involved. When the insertion order is with an advertising agency, we generally consider the client on whose behalf the advertising campaign is conducted as the "client" for purposes of this calculation. In the event a client has its advertising spend with us managed by multiple agencies, that client is counted as a single client.
Our client base is composed of two client categories: the large client category and the midmarket category. We define large clients as the top-50 or the top-100 commerce websites per vertical in a given geographic market, depending on the depth of that market, based on the number of monthly unique visitors as measured by comScore or other third-party providers of such information. We define a midmarket client as any client outside of the large client category per vertical in a given geographic market, depending on the depth of that market, and with a certain minimum threshold number of unique monthly visitors to their digital property, as measured by comScore or other third-party providers of such information. This minimum threshold varies by market, but is generally around 40,000 unique monthly visitors for our more developed markets. The delineation between the large client and midmarket categories is fluid and the Company may decide, from time to time, to move some clients from one category to another.
In 2018, we began a go-to-market transformation aimed at maximizing the commercial opportunity for our multi-solution offering. As part of this transformation, we have taken a more granular approach to the segmentation of our client base and have divided our existing and addressable clients into six segments, based on clients' size and business potential with us. The top-two client segments belong to the large client category and are serviced through a consultative approach delivered by a fully dedicated team of Criteo sales and account strategists. The middle-two client segments belong to the midmarket category and are serviced by an integrated and largely automated telesales approach. The lowest-two client segments also belong to the midmarket category and are meant to be entirely serviced through our self-service client platform, the onboarding module of which we expect to roll out in 2019.

Research and Development 
We invest substantial resources in research and development to conduct fundamental research on artificial intelligence, machine-learning models, enhance the algorithms in Criteo AI Engine, develop new features and solutions, conduct quality assurance testing, improve our core technology and enhance our technology infrastructure. Our engineering group is primarily located in research and development centers in Paris, France; Grenoble, France; Palo Alto, California and Ann Arbor, Michigan. We expect to continue to expand capabilities of our technology in the future and to invest significantly in continued research and development and new solutions efforts. We had over 700 employees primarily engaged Research and Development and Product as of December 31, 2018. Research and development expenses, including expenses related to the Product group, totaled $123.6 million, $173.9 million and $179.3 million for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.
Intellectual Property 
Our intellectual property rights are a key component of our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. We generally require employees, consultants, clients, publishers, suppliers and partners to execute confidentiality agreements with us that restrict the disclosure of our intellectual property. We also generally require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights.
Intellectual property laws, together with our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of France and the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.
Agreements with our employees and consultants may also be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies to address any breach. Further, to the extent that our employees or consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights to know-how and inventions relating thereto or resulting therefrom. Finally, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the Advertising Platform for the Open Internet or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
As of December 31, 2018, we held five patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, one patent issued by the French Patent Office, one patent issued by the European Patent Office, one patent issued by the Japan Patent Office and one patent issued by the Korean Intellectual Property Office, and had filed 29 non-provisional U.S. patent applications, five European patent applications and one international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. We also own and use registered and unregistered trademarks on or in connection with our products and services in numerous jurisdictions. In addition, we have also registered numerous internet domain names.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the technology industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, have asserted and may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our clients or our publishers.

Privacy, Data Protection and Content Control
Legal and Regulatory
Privacy and data protection laws play a significant role in our business. The regulatory environment for the collection and use of consumer data by advertising networks, advertisers and publishers is frequently evolving in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. The United States and foreign governments have enacted, considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants’ ability to collect, augment, analyze, use and share non-identifying data, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can utilize cookies or other tracking technologies.
In the United States, at both the federal and state level, there are laws that govern activities such as the collection and use of data by companies like us. At the federal level, online advertising activities in the United States have primarily been subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, which has regularly relied upon Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or Section 5, to enforce against unfair and deceptive trade practices, including alleged violations of consumer privacy interests. Various states have also enacted legislation that governs these practices. For example, on September 27, 2013, the governor of California signed into law AB 370, an amendment to the California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003, or CalOPPA. This amendment requires that we disclose in our privacy policy how we respond to web browser "do not track" signals. Our current privacy policy discloses that we do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals but that we do respond to opt-out requests made through our proprietary opt-out button or through industry opt-out platforms (namely Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance). However, the US privacy law framework may be subject to significant evolutions in the near future both at a federal and at a state level. At a federal level, law makers are currently considering the possibility of adopting a federal privacy law. While we cannot anticipate the chances of success and potential output of this initiative, the State of California already passed a new law (the California Consumer Privacy Act) intended to better protect the privacy of consumers. This new law will come into force on January 1st 2020 and will notably impose more stringent obligations on companies regarding the level of information and control they provide to consumers about the collection and sharing of their data. This act also offers the possibility to any consumer who has suffered a violation of this act to recover statutory damages and could therefore open the door to additional risks of individual and class-action lawsuits. 
In addition, the Advertising Platform for the Open Internet reaches users throughout the world, including in Europe, Australia, Canada, South America and Asia-Pacific. As a result, some of our activities may also be subject to the laws of foreign jurisdictions. In particular, data protection laws in Europe can be more restrictive regarding the collection and use of data than those in U.S. jurisdictions.
In the European Union, the two main pillars of the data protection legal framework are the E-Privacy Directive (Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications), which is currently under review, and the new General Data Protection Regulation, adopted in April 2016 and enforceable since May 2018.
Directive 2002/581-EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, or the E-Privacy Directive, was amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 25, 2009, or the E-Privacy Directive Amendment, to require countries in the European Union to enact specific legislation requiring companies like ours, along with advertisers and publishers, to present users with an information notice and to obtain their consent prior to placing cookies or other tracking technologies for purposes of targeted advertising. The E-Privacy Directive Amendment was intended to be implemented in all 28 countries of the European Union, but it has been implemented differently across the European Union member states. As a consequence the questions regarding the form and conditions of a valid consent (e.g. explicit versus implied consent) have remained only partially settled within the European Union. 
While the European Institutions are still in the process of adopting a regulation proposal to review the E-Privacy Directive, there is no assurance that tracking for advertising purposes will not be affected, as the mechanisms for "cookie" consent are being re-discussed. 
In December 2016, E.U. institutions reached an agreement on a draft regulation that was formally adopted in April 2016, referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). The GDPR updates and modernizes the principles of the 1995 Data Protection Directive. The GDPR significantly increases the level of sanctions for non-compliance. The European Union data protection authorities will have the power to impose administrative fines of up to a maximum of €20 million or 4% of the data controller's or data processor's total worldwide global turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. We believe that the regulation has no material impact on our business or the way our technologies operate. However, GDPR is still a recent regulation with no established case law. Therefore interpretations of the GDPR may vary, especially with respect to the articulation between GDPR (lex generali) and E-Privacy Directive (lex speciali) and the conditions for the collection of a valid "cookie" consent, and thus there can be no assurance that this will not have any particular impact on our business, technologies or practices.

To illustrate this risk of different interpretations by the competent authorities, the French Data Protection Authority (Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés) and Spanish Data Protection Authority (Agencia Espanola de Proteccion de Datos) published guidance in which it is stated that continuing to browse a website could materialize the consent of a user for cookie tracking, while the UK Data Protection Authority (Information Commissioner's Office) is listing stricter requirements in its own guidance and seems to impose a very clear and specific statement of consent.
As we continue to expand into other foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.
Self-Regulation
In addition to complying with extensive government regulations, we voluntarily and actively participate in several trade associations and industry self-regulatory groups that promulgate best practices or codes of conduct relating to targeted advertising. For example, the Internet Advertising Bureau EU & US, the Network Advertising Initiative, the European Digital Advertising Alliance and the Digital Advertising Alliance have developed and implemented guidance for companies to provide notice and choice to users regarding targeted advertising.
In addition to complying with such guidance, we provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising, and allow them to opt out from the use of such data for the delivery of targeted advertising. In an effort to harmonize the industry’s approach to internet-based advertising, these programs facilitate a user's ability to disable services of integrated providers, but also educate users on the potential benefits of online advertising, including access to free content and display of more relevant advertisements to them. The rules and policies of the self-regulatory programs that we participate in are updated from time to time and may impose additional restrictions upon us in the future.
In 2009, we became one of the first companies to broadly include an "Ad Choices" link in all the advertisements we deliver, which gives users access to clear, transparent, detailed and user-friendly information about personalized advertisements and the data practices associated with the advertisements they receive. In addition, we provide consumers with an easy-to-use and easy-to-access mechanism to control their advertising experience and opt out of receiving targeted advertisements we deliver, either for all campaigns or for a specific client or specific period of time.
We believe that this transparent consumer-centric approach to privacy empowers consumers to make better-informed decisions about our use of their data. We also actively encourage our clients and publishers to provide information to consumers about our collection and use of data relating to the advertisements we deliver and monitor.
Content Control and Brand Safety 
To protect against unlawful advertiser and publisher content, we include restrictions on content in our terms and conditions. We also take a large variety of brand safety measures to ensure that the brand equity of our clients is preserved as much as possible. These measures include determining that each publisher's inventory meets our content requirements and those of our clients to ensure that their display advertisements are not shown in inappropriate content categories. For that purpose, we use numerous internal systems and processes to filter out inventory in real time, including the list of suspect IP addresses from the Trustworthy Accountability Group and the lists of invalid traffic from several specialized external vendors. With respect to our inventory purchased through RTB exchanges, we utilize a mix of proprietary methodologies as well as third-party software to verify that inventory where the advertisement placement is shown conforms to our advertising guidelines and the content expectations and branding guidelines of our clients. 
Government Regulation
In addition to the laws and regulations governing privacy and data protection described above, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.

Competition 
We compete in the broader market for digital advertising, primarily through Display Advertising. Our market is rapidly evolving, highly competitive, complex and still fragmented, although rapidly consolidating. We face significant competition in this market, which we expect to intensify in the future, partially as a result of potential new entrants in our market, including but not limited to large well-established internet publishers and players, in particular as we continue to expand the breadth of our offering. We currently compete with large, well-established companies, such as Google, Amazon.com ("Amazon"), Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook"), as well as smaller, privately held companies. Potential competition could emerge from large enterprise marketing platforms, like Adobe Systems Inc. ("Adobe"), Oracle Corporation ("Oracle"), and Salesforce.com, Inc. ("Salesforce"). In addition, web browsers, and desktop and mobile operating systems developed by large software companies like Google and Apple Inc. ("Apple") can have a significant influence and impact on the way we operate. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include: 

• | access to granular commerce data on a large scale;


• | technology-based ability to activate commerce data for multiple marketing goals, including sales generation;


• | technology-based ability to generate high return on advertising spend at scale;


• | breadth and depth of consumer reach;


• | measurability of the advertising spend performance, based on clear and transparent measurement metrics;


• | completeness and effectiveness of solutions across digital devices, commerce and advertising environments, platforms and operating systems, advertising channels and publisher environments;


• | relevance and breadth of solutions to address numerous marketing goals;


• | advertiser control over the objectives, components and performance of their campaigns through a modular, flexible and easy-to-use self-service technology platform;


• | openness, transparency, security and fairness of data sharing and data management practices;


• | client trust;


• | global presence;


• | client service and detailed, transparent client reporting;


• | commitment to data protection and user privacy; and


• | ease of use.

We believe that we are well positioned with respect to all of these factors and expect to continue to grow and capture an increasing share of digital advertising budgets worldwide.
Seasonality
Our client base consists primarily commerce of companies in the retail, travel and classifieds industries industries, which we refer to as “commerce companies” or “commerce clients”. In the digital retail industry in particular, many businesses devote the largest portion of their advertising spend to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday spending by consumers. With respect to Criteo Retail Media, the concentration of advertising spend in the fourth quarter of the calendar year may be particularly pronounced. Our commerce clients in the retail industry typically conduct fewer advertising campaigns in the first and second quarters than they do in other quarters, while our commerce clients in the travel industry typically increase their travel campaigns in the first and third quarters and conduct fewer advertising campaigns in the second quarter. As a result, our revenue tends to be seasonal in nature, but the impact of this seasonality has, to date, been partly offset by our significant growth and geographic expansion. If the seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced, our operating cash flows could fluctuate materially from period to period.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,744 employees. Our employees employed by French entities (1,007 employees) are represented by a labor union, employee representative bodies (works' council, employee delegates and a health and safety committee) and covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider labor relations to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations.
