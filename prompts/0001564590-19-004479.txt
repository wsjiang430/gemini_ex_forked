Market Overview, Products, Systems and Solutions
 Badger Meter is an innovator in flow measurement, control and related communication solutions, serving water utilities, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers worldwide.  The Company’s products measure water, oil, chemicals and other fluids, and are known for accuracy, long-lasting durability and for providing valuable and timely measurement data through various methods.  The Company’s product lines fall into two categories: sales of water meters, radios and related technologies to municipal water utilities (municipal water) and sales of meters, valves and other products for industrial applications in water, wastewater, and other industries (flow instrumentation).  The Company estimates that over 85% of its products are used in water related applications.
 Municipal water, the largest sales category, is comprised of either mechanical or static (ultrasonic) water meters along with the related radio and software technologies and services used by municipal water utilities as the basis for generating their water and wastewater revenues.  The largest geographic market for the Company’s municipal water products is North America, primarily the United States, because most of the Company's meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association.  The majority of water meters sold by the Company continue to be mechanical in nature; however, ultrasonic meters are gaining in penetration due to a variety of factors, including their ability to maintain measurement accuracy over their useful life.  Providing ultrasonic water meter technology, combined with advanced radio technology, provides the Company with the opportunity to sell into other geographical markets, for example the Middle East and Europe.  
 Flow instrumentation includes meters and valves sold worldwide to measure and control fluids going through a pipe or pipeline including water, air, steam, oil, and other liquids and gases.  These products are used in a variety of industries and applications, with the Company’s primary market focus being water/wastewater; heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC); oil and gas, and chemical and petrochemical.  Flow instrumentation products are generally sold to original equipment manufacturers as the primary flow measurement device within a product or system, as well as through manufacturers’ representatives.
 Municipal water meters (both residential and commercial) are generally classified as either manually read meters or remotely read meters via radio technology.  A manually read meter consists of a water meter and a register that provides a visual totalized meter reading.  Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from battery-powered encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility usage and billing systems.  These remotely read systems are classified as either automatic meter reading (AMR) systems, where a vehicle equipped for meter reading purposes, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collects the data from utilities’ meters; or advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, where data is gathered utilizing a network (either fixed or cellular) of data collectors or gateway receivers that are able to receive radio data transmission from the utilities’ meters.  AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to drive through service territories to collect data from the meters.  These systems provide utilities with more frequent and diverse data from their meters at specified intervals.
 The ORION® branded family of radio endpoints provides water utilities with a range of industry-leading options for meter reading.  These include ORION Migratable (ME) for AMR meter reading, ORION (SE) for traditional fixed network applications, and ORION Cellular for an infrastructure-free meter reading solution.  ORION Migratable makes the migration to fixed network easier for utilities that prefer to start with mobile reading and later adopt fixed network communications, allowing utilities to choose a solution for their current needs and be positioned for their future operational changes.  ORION Cellular eliminates the need for utility-owned fixed network infrastructure, allows for gradual or full deployment, and decreases ongoing maintenance.

Critical to the water metering ecosystem is information and analytics.  The Company’s BEACON® Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) software suite improves the utilities’ visibility of their water and water usage.  BEACON AMA is a secure, cloud-hosted software suite that includes a customizable dashboard, and has the ability to establish alerts for specific conditions.  It also allows for consumer engagement tools that permit end water users (such as homeowners) to view and manage their water usage activity.  Benefits to the utility include improved customer service, increased visibility through faster leak detection, the ability to promote and quantify the effects of its water conservation efforts, and easier compliance reporting.
 Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products.  To a much lesser extent, housing starts also contribute to the new product sales base.  Over the last decade, there has been a growing trend in the conversion from manually read water meters to meters with radio technology.  This conversion rate is accelerating, with the Company estimating that approximately 60% of water meters installed in the United States have been converted to a radio solution technology.
 The Company’s net sales and corresponding net earnings depend on unit volume and product mix, with the Company generally earning higher average selling prices and margins on meters equipped with radio technology, and higher margins on ultrasonic compared to mechanical meters.  The Company’s proprietary radio products (i.e. ORION) generally result in higher margins than the remarketed, non-proprietary technology products.  The Company also sells registers and endpoints separately to customers who wish to upgrade their existing meters in the field.  
 Flow instrumentation products are used in flow measurement and control applications across a broad industrial spectrum, occasionally leveraging the same technologies used in the municipal water category.  Specialized communication protocols that control the entire flow measurement process and mandatory certifications drive these markets.  The Company provides both standard and customized flow instrumentation solutions.
 The industries served by the Company’s flow instrumentation products face accelerating demands to contain costs, reduce product variability, and meet ever-changing safety, regulatory and sustainability requirements.  To address these challenges, customers must reap more value from every component in their systems.  This system-wide scrutiny has heightened the focus on flow instrumentation in industrial process, manufacturing, commercial fluid, building automation and precision engineering applications where flow measurement and control are critical.
 A leader in both mechanical and static (ultrasonic) flow metering technologies for industrial markets, the Company offers one of the broadest flow measurement, control and communication portfolios in the market.  This portfolio carries respected brand names including Recordall®, Hedland®, Dynasonics®, Blancett®, and Research Control®, and includes eight of the ten major flow meter technologies.  Customers rely on the Company for application-specific solutions that deliver accurate, timely and dependable flow data and control essential for product quality, cost control, safer operations, regulatory compliance and more sustainable operations.
 The Company's products are sold throughout the world through employees, resellers and representatives.  Depending on the customer mix, there can be a moderate seasonal impact on sales, primarily relating to higher sales of certain municipal water products during the spring and summer months.  No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Company's sales.
 Competition
 The Company faces competition for both its municipal water and flow instrumentation product lines.  The competition varies from moderate to strong depending upon the products involved and the markets served.  Major competitors for utility water meters include Xylem, Inc. (“Sensus”), Roper Technologies, Inc. (“Neptune”), Master Meter, Inc. and Mueller Water Products, Inc.  Together with Badger Meter, it is estimated that these companies sell in excess of 90% of the water meters in the North American market, which has historically been somewhat insulated from organic growth by other competitors due to the nature of the mechanical technology used and the standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association.  As static metering technology continues to gain traction, additional competitors include firms such as Kamstrup A/S, Diehl Metering GmbH and Itron, Inc., although these competitors lack brand recognition and do not have extensive water utility channel distribution, which impedes their ability to compete.  In addition, as previously noted, the technology acceptance also provides competitive opportunities for Badger Meter outside North America.
 The Company's primary competitors for water utility radio products in North America are Itron, Inc., Neptune and Sensus.  While the vast majority of the Company’s radio sales are of its own proprietary radio systems (ORION and GALAXY®), it is also a reseller of Itron® products.  A number of the Company's competitors in certain markets have greater financial resources than the Company.  The Company, however, believes it currently provides the leading technologies in water meters and water-dedicated radio solutions.  As a result of significant research and development activities, the Company enjoys favorable patent positions and trade secret protections for several of its technologies, products and processes.

There are many competitors in the flow instrumentation markets due to the various end markets and applications being served.  They include, among others, Emerson Electric Company, Krohne Messtechnik GmbH, Endress+Hauser AG, Yokogawa Electric Corporation and Cameron International.  With a broad portfolio consisting of products utilizing eight of the ten major flow meter technologies, the Company is well positioned to compete in niche, specialized applications within these markets, primarily focused on the water/wastewater, HVAC, oil & gas and chemical/petrochemical end markets.
 Backlog
 The Company's total backlog of unshipped orders at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $29.9 million and $28.9 million, respectively.  The backlog is comprised of firm orders and signed contractual commitments, or portions of such commitments that call for shipment within 12 months.  Backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of orders for large projects and the amounts can vary due to the timing of work performed.
Raw Materials and Components
 Raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products include purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, glass, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and components.  There are multiple sources for these raw materials and components, but the Company relies on single suppliers for certain brass castings, resins and electronic subassemblies.  The Company believes these items would be available from other sources, but that the loss of certain suppliers would result in a higher cost of materials, delivery delays, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality control costs in the short term.  The Company carries business interruption insurance on key suppliers.  The Company's purchases of raw materials are based on production schedules, and as a result, inventory on hand is generally not exposed to price fluctuations.  World commodity markets and currency exchange rates may also affect the prices of material purchased in the future.  The Company does not hold significant amounts of precious metals.
Research and Development
 Expenditures for research and development activities related to the development of new products, the improvement of existing products and manufacturing process improvements were $11.1 million in 2018 and $10.6 million in both 2017 and 2016.  Research and development activities are primarily sponsored by the Company.  The Company also engages in some joint research and development with other companies and organizations.
Intangible Assets
 The Company owns or controls several trade secrets and many patents, trademarks and trade names in the United States and other countries that relate to its products and technologies.  No single patent, trademark, trade name or trade secret is material to the Company's business as a whole.
Environmental Protection
 The Company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations.  A future change in circumstances with respect to these specific matters or with respect to sites formerly or currently owned or operated by the Company, off-site disposal locations used by the Company, and property owned by third parties that is near such sites, could result in future costs to the Company and such amounts could be material.  Expenditures for compliance control provisions and regulations during 2018, 2017 and 2016 were not material.
Employees
 The Company and its subsidiaries employed 1,531 persons at December 31, 2018. Approximately 110 of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with District 10 of the International Association of Machinists.  The Company is currently operating under a three-year contract with the union, which expires on October 31, 2019.  The Company believes it has good relations with the union and all of its employees.
