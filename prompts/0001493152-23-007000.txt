ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Our Historical Nestbuilder Business
 
Prior to our merger with Renewable Innovations, Inc., a Delaware corporation, we were engaged in the business of providing digital media and marketing services for the real estate industry. We generated revenue from service fees (video creation and production and referral fees from our LoseTheAgent.com website). At the core of our programs was our proprietary video creation technology which allowed for an automated conversion of data (text, video slices and pictures of home listings) to a video with voice over and music. We provided video search, storage and marketing capabilities on multiple platform dynamics for web and mobile. Once a home, personal or community video was created using our proprietary technology, it could be published to social media, email or distributed to multiple real estate websites.
 
In addition, we owned and operated the web site LoseTheAgent.com, which was a site dedicated to peer-to-peer real estate transactions between home sellers and buyers - the so called For Sale By Owner segment. We had as many as 100,000 home listings across all 50 states. We monetized the website by charging fees for both listing a home for sale and picking up possible buyers’ messages of interest.
 
We discontinued the historical business of Nestbuilder.com on February 28, 2023.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated on June 28, 2019 and commenced operations in 2021.
 
On December 1, 2022, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, we were acquired by Nestbuilder.com Corp through the merger of NB Merger Corp. with and into Renewable Innovations, Inc., with Renewable Innovations, Inc. continuing as the surviving wholly owned subsidiary of Nestbuilder.com Corp. Renewable Innovations, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the wholly owned subsidiary), changed its name to Renewable Innovations Corp., and Nestbuilder.com Corp (the parent corporation) changed its name to Renewable Innovations, Inc.

Overview
 
We are focused on designing, optimizing, developing, and producing modular, scalable, zero-carbon green renewable solutions. Applications for scalable power vary from primary power to emergency power and mobile power.
 
Our initial focus is on mobile and stationary electric vehicle rapid charging.
 
We leverage our deep engineering expertise, history in power, and market vision and combine those with industry leaders through collaboration agreements for best product, best price, and best availability One example of this is our collaboration agreement with General Motors (“GM”) for its fuel cells and batteries.
 
Our expertise and leadership experience in the industry began in 2014 when we began developing polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells for datacenter backup power. This collaboration was with Daimler, Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
 
In 2017, a fuel cell system was installed at NREL and demonstrated to attendees during the Super Computing Show held in Denver that year. In 2019 and 2020 full load testing and validation of 250 kilowatt (“kW”) fuel cells were performed over 24- and 48-hour non-stop runs with Microsoft. The tests were considered successful and began an evolution for others to explore this solution.
 
We are focused on taking advantage of the projected growth of the hydrogen market by continuing to design and build stationary power systems using hydrogen fuel cells. Our first product, the “MEC-H” (Mobile Energy Command-Hydrogen) has been tested in multiple commercial applications including the Rebelle Rally in October 2021 when the product was used to power the all-women’s race in the deserts of Nevada and California.

The Market
 
In the past, the technology wasn’t quite ready, or people were not serious enough about decarbonization. We don’t believe that those barriers exist today. With the barriers removed, we believe the hydrogen economy will enter into a renaissance in the 2020s and will create an $11 trillion hydrogen market in the coming decades1.
 
Despite its series of false starts over the past 50 years, hydrogen is finally coming into its own global adoption as the fuel of the future. We believe four factors are relevant to this change:
 

● | we believe any power source made with hydrogen will be infinitely more energy-dense than a power source made with something else; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the politics have changed: 


○ | President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, which includes nearly $400 billion in energy and climate spending. A significant bulk of that will go toward clean hydrogen production; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $9.5 Billion in clean hydrogen initiatives; 


● | hydrogen is now produced cost-effectively from renewable energy sources like solar and wind instead of natural gas. Economies of scale and advanced tech have led hydrogen fuel cell costs to drop 60% over the past decade. Deloitte expects those costs to drop below electric battery and combustion engine costs in just a few years. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the technology has changed. Technological breakthroughs and falling renewable energy expenses have led to a new era of scalable “Green Hydrogen” production. 

 
We are accelerating the growth and opportunities within the renewable economy. Our team brings experience and connections across the sector.

Intellectual Property Rights
 
We have developed significant intellectual and proprietary technologies for the renewable industry; however, we do not own any patents or trademarks. We use the following methods to protect our intellectual property:
Copyright Protection
 
Copyright law protects the source and object code of software and ensures exclusive rights. Copyright protection arises automatically upon the creation of an original work of authorship. The duration of a copyright is the author’s life plus fifty years. We have common law copyright protection of our designs.
Trade Secret Protection
 
We choose to protect many of the ideas and concepts behind our product offerings as trade secrets.
 
From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. While we believe that our product and service offerings do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party, we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute. If we do not prevail in such disputes, we may lose some or all of our intellectual property protection, be enjoined from further sales of the applications determined to infringe the rights of others, and/or be forced to pay substantial royalties to a third party.
Governmental Controls, Approval and Licensing Requirements
 
Our products are subject to international, federal, state, and local requirements in accordance with statutes and ordinances relating to, among others, building codes, fire codes, public safety, electrical codes, etc. The level of regulation varies based on location.
 
Safety standards have been established by the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”), covering the overall fuel cell system, however additional safety practices are being refined and defined by organizations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Center for Hydrogen Safety (CHS), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and the International Fire Code (IFC). Our products are designed to meet and exceed all applicable safety standards.
  
Competition
 
The U.S. power grid is not capable of providing sufficient power or available to charge the electric vehicles that are coming to market. Power sources independent from the gird will be needed. Hydrogen is one source of power capable of providing large amounts of power for charging these vehicles.
 
Stationary and primary power is also another significant marked for fuel cells systems. Applications range from large data centers and corporate facilities, to smaller mobile and emergency services. Although there is more competition arising in these areas, we feel we have a lead in these applications.
 
There are multiple PEM fuel cell manufactures in the world, including General Motors, Toyota, Hyundai, Honda, Ballard, PLUG Power, Fuel Cell Energy, to name a few. Most manufacturers typically do not do integration. Some automotive manufacturers will install versions of their fuel cells systems in certain vehicles, others will contract or partner with other companies to integrate their fuel cells into vehicles.
 
We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate will include product features relative to price and performance, lifetime operating cost, including any maintenance and support, product quality and reliability, safety, ease of use, footprint, rapid integration with existing equipment and processes as well as service and support and corporate reputation.
 
Employees
 
We currently employ between 30 and 50 personnel which is comprised of full time, part time and contract personnel.
