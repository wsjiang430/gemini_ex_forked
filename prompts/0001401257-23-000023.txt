These consumable products are used in drilling, well construction and completions activities and at processing centers and refineries. Our engineered capital products are directed at drilling rig equipment for constructing new or upgrading existing rigs, subsea construction and development projects, pressure pumping equipment, the placement of production equipment on new producing wells, downstream capital projects and capital equipment for renewable energy projects. In 2022, over 68% of our revenue was derived from consumable products and activity-based equipment, while the balance was primarily derived from capital products with a small amount from rental and other services.
We design, manufacture and supply high quality reliable products that create value for our diverse customer base, which includes, among others, oil and natural gas operators, land and offshore drilling contractors, oilfield service companies, subsea construction and service companies, and pipeline and refinery operators. In addition, we offer some of our products to renewable energy and new energy companies. 
We expect that the world's long-term energy demand will continue to rise. We also expect hydrocarbons will continue to play a vital role in meeting the world's long-term energy needs while renewable energy sources continue to develop. As such, we remain focused on serving our customers in both oil and natural gas as well as renewable energy applications. We are also continuing to develop products to help oil and natural gas operators lower their emissions while also deploying our existing product technologies in renewable energy applications and seeking to develop innovative equipment.
Our reporting segments align with business activity drivers and the manner in which management reviews and evaluates operating performance. FET operates in the following three reporting segments: Drilling & Downhole, Completions and Production. We believe that the reporting segment structure is aligned with the key phases of the well cycle and provides operating efficiencies. 
We incorporate by reference the segment and geographic information for the last two years set forth in Note 17 Business Segments, and the information with respect to an acquisition set forth in Note 4 Acquisition.
DRILLING AND DOWNHOLE SEGMENT
Our Drilling & Downhole segment designs, manufactures and supplies products and provides related services to the drilling, well construction, artificial lift and subsea energy construction markets, including applications in oil and natural gas, renewable energy, defense, and communications. The products and related services consist primarily of (i) capital equipment and a broad line of expendable products consumed in the drilling process; (ii) well construction casing and cementing equipment and protection products for artificial lift equipment and cables; and (iii) subsea remotely operated vehicles and trenchers, submarine rescue vehicles, specialty components and tooling, and complementary subsea technical services.
There are several factors that drive demand for our Drilling & Downhole segment.

Coiled tubing strings are consumable components utilized to perform well completion and intervention activities. Our coiled line pipe offering serves as an alternative to conventional line pipe and composite flexibles in onshore and offshore applications. In addition, our coiled line pipe offering can be utilized for carbon capture projects to transport carbon for injection into underground storage.
The product line’s primary customers are domestic and international service companies that provide coiled tubing services and oil and gas operators.
PRODUCTION SEGMENT
Our Production segment designs, manufactures and supplies products and provides related equipment and services for production and infrastructure markets. The products and related services consist primarily of: (i) engineered process systems, production equipment, as well as specialty separation equipment; and (ii) a wide range of industrial valves focused on serving oil and natural gas customers as well as power generation, renewable energy and other general industrial applications.
The segment’s primary market driver is the level of spending associated with new producing wells as well as spending on midstream and downstream projects. In addition, demand for our Valve Solutions products is affected by activity levels in the power generation, process, petrochemical and mining industries. 
Production Equipment. Our Production Equipment product line provides engineered process systems for capital equipment used at the wellsite and for production processing in the U.S. Once a well has been drilled, completed and brought on stream, we provide the well operator with process equipment necessary to make the oil or natural gas ready for transmission. We engineer, fabricate and install separators, packaged production systems and pressure vessels, skidded vessels with gas measurement, modular process plants, header and manifold skids, process and flow control equipment and separators to help clean and process oil or natural gas as it travels from the wellhead and along the transmission line to the refinery. Our customers are principally U.S. oil and natural gas operators or producers.
We also design and provide process oil treatment equipment, including EDGE® and NU-STATIC® branded desalters and dehydrator technologies, used in refineries and other process applications worldwide. We have a team of highly trained technicians and field service engineers for repair and installation, and we supply a broad range of replacement parts for our equipment and other manufacturers. This equipment removes sand, water and suspended solids from hydrocarbons prior to their transmission or refining. 
Valve Solutions. We provide a wide range of industrial valves that principally serve the upstream, midstream and downstream markets of the oil and natural gas industry. Our valves also serve general industrial, power generation and process industry customers as well as the mining industry. In addition, our Canadian operations provide significant exposure to heavy oil projects. We provide ball, gate, globe and check valves across a range of sizes and applications. 
We market our valves to our customers and end users through our recognized brands: PBV®, DSI® and Accuseal®. Much of our production is sold through distribution supply companies, with our marketing efforts targeting end users for pull through of our valve products. 
Our supply chain systems enable us to design and sell high-quality engineered valves, as well as provide standardized products, while maintaining competitive pricing and minimizing capital requirements. We utilize our international manufacturing partners to produce completed products and components for the majority of our valve products. 
Depending on the product, our valves are manufactured to conform to the standards of one or more of the API, American National Standards Institute, American Bureau of Shipping, and International Organization for Standardization and/or other relevant standards governing the design and manufacture of industrial valves. 
Business history 
Forum was incorporated in 2005 and formed through a series of acquisitions. In August 2010, Forum Oilfield Technologies, Inc. was renamed Forum Energy Technologies, Inc., when four other companies were merged into Forum. On April 17, 2012, we completed our initial public offering.
Backlog
As we provide a mix of consumable products, capital goods, and repair parts and services, the majority of orders and commitments included in our backlog as of December 31, 2022 are scheduled to be delivered within six months. Our backlog was approximately $264.8 million at December 31, 2022 and approximately $196.5 million at December 31, 2021. Substantially all of the projects currently in our backlog are subject to change and our customers may seek to terminate these orders. However, customers are generally required to pay us for work performed as well as other costs and fees as a result of such changes or termination. It is difficult to predict how much of our current backlog may be delayed or terminated, or subject to changes, as well as our ability to collect termination or change fees. 
Our consumable and repair products are predominantly off-the-shelf items requiring short lead-times, generally less than six months, and our related refurbishment or other services are also not contracted with significant lead time. The composition of our backlog is reflective of our mix of capital equipment, consumable products, aftermarket and other related items. Our bookings, which consist of written orders or commitments for our products or related services, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $780.7 million and $632.3 million, respectively. 
Customers
No customer represented more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any of the last two years.
Seasonality
Our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality. However, our customers are susceptible to exhausting their capital and operating budgets in the fourth quarter. As a result, we may experience decreased demand for our products in the fourth quarter. In addition, given the geographic proximity of a number of our facilities to the Gulf Coast, we are subject to business interruptions caused by hurricanes and tropical storms. Furthermore, a small portion of the revenue we generate from select Canadian operations often benefits from higher first quarter activity levels, as operators take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. 
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with a number of companies of varying sizes. There are several large national and multinational companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition. In addition, we have several smaller competitors who compete with us on a regional or local basis. These competitors are often times very quick to respond to new or emerging technologies and services, and changes in customer requirements. The principal competitive factors in our markets are product quality and performance, price, breadth of product offering, availability of products and services, performance, distribution capabilities, technical expertise, responsiveness to customer needs, reputation for service and intellectual property rights. We believe our products and services in each segment are comparable in price, quality, performance and dependability with our competitors’ offerings. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing a rapid response to the needs of our customers, expert knowledge, a high level of customer service, and innovative product development initiatives. Some of our competitors expend greater amounts of money than us on formal research and engineering efforts. We believe, however, that our product development efforts are enhanced by the investment of management time that we make to improve our customer service and to work with our customers on their specific product needs and challenges.
Although we have no single competitor across all of our product lines, the companies we compete with across the greatest number of our product lines include National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Cameron International Corporation (a subsidiary of Schlumberger), TechnipFMC plc, Tenaris S.A., and Caterpillar, Inc.
Patents, trademarks and other intellectual property
We currently hold multiple U.S. and international patents and trademarks, have a number of pending patent and trademark applications and have developed a significant amount of trade secrets or other know how in the areas where we compete. Although our patents, trademarks, licenses, trade secrets and know how are material to us in the aggregate, we do not regard any single piece of intellectual property to be material to our business as a whole.
Raw materials
We acquire component parts, products and raw materials from suppliers, including foundries, forge shops, and original equipment manufacturers. The prices we pay for our raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, steel and other commodity prices, inflationary pressures, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency exchange rates. Certain of our component parts, products or raw materials, such as bearings, are only available from a limited number of suppliers. Please see “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—We rely on relationships with key suppliers to operate and maintain our business.” 
Timely receipt of raw materials is critical to our business. In 2021, we were negatively impacted by various transportation and other supply chain constraints, which caused manufacturing delays for some of our products. During 2022, supply chain constraints eased; however, raw material prices for many of our product lines were negatively impacted by inflationary pressures. In the future, while we anticipate inflationary pressures will improve, and supply chain constraints will continue to ease, the timing of any reduction in inflation is unknown, and it is unclear whether we will be able to continue purchasing raw materials on a timely basis or at acceptable prices. We generally try to purchase raw materials from multiple suppliers so that we are not dependent on any one supplier, but this is not always possible.
Working Capital
An important consideration for many of our customers in selecting a vendor is timely availability of the product. Customers may pay a premium for earlier or immediate availability because of the cost of delays in critical operations. We stock our consumable products in regional warehouses or on consignment around the world so that these products are available for our customers when needed. This availability is especially critical for certain consumable products, causing us to carry substantial inventories for these products. For critical capital items in which demand is expected to be strong, we often build certain items before we have a firm order. Our having such goods available on short notice can be of great value to our customers. We also stock raw materials and components in order to be in a position to build products in response to market demand.
We typically offer our customers standard payment terms of 30 days, although during downturns in activity, customers often take 65 days or more to settle accounts. For sales into certain countries or for select customers, we might require payment upfront or credit support through a letter of credit. For longer term projects, we typically require progress payments as important milestones are reached. On average, we collect our receivables in about 60 days from shipment resulting in a substantial investment in accounts receivable. Standard terms with our vendors are 90 days. For critical items sourced from significant vendors, we have settled accounts more quickly, sometimes in exchange for early payment discounts.
Governmental regulation
Our operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection. In addition to environmental and worker safety regulations, we are subject to regulation by numerous other governmental regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Labor and other state, local and international bodies regulating worker rights and labor conditions. In addition, we are subject to certain requirements to contribute to retirement funds or other benefit plans and laws in some jurisdictions in which we operate restrict our ability to dismiss employees. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations or to obtain or comply with permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements, and the imposition of injunctions to prohibit certain activities or force future compliance.
The trend in environmental regulation has been to impose increasingly stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or in enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Moreover, 
accidental releases or spills of regulated substances may occur in the course of our operations, and if so, we may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Hazardous substances and waste
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. We are required to manage the transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in compliance with the RCRA.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for manufacturing and other operations for many years. We also contract with waste removal services and landfills. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to the CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment.
Hydraulic fracturing
A significant percentage of our customers’ oil and natural gas production is being developed from unconventional sources, such as hydrocarbon shales. These formations require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the oil or natural gas from the rock so that it can flow through the formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate production. A number of federal agencies, including the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy, are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with shale development, including hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, various political groups and officials are requesting or have discussed implementing a ban on hydraulic fracturing, or oil & gas extraction generally, on federal lands. For more information, please read “Risk Factors-Potential legislation or regulations restricting the use of hydraulic fracturing could reduce demand for our products.”
Operating risk and insurance
We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for companies of our size and with similar operations. In accordance with industry practice, however, we do not maintain insurance coverage against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. Therefore, there is a risk our insurance program may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or all losses. Currently, our insurance program includes coverage for, among other things, general liability, umbrella liability, sudden and accidental pollution, personal property, vehicles, workers’ compensation, and employer’s liability coverage. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,500 employees. Of our total employees, approximately 1,100 were in the U.S., 150 were in the United Kingdom, 100 were in Germany, 100 were in Canada and 50 were in other locations. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, other than in our Hamburg, Germany facility. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
