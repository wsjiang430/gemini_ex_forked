ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
On March 19, 2019, DSW Inc. changed its name to Designer Brands Inc. References to "DSW" refer to the DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse banner unless otherwise stated. The Company was incorporated in the state of Ohio in 1969, and we opened our first DSW store in Dublin, Ohio in 1991. As a result of our recent acquisitions, discussed below, we have transformed our business with global product development capabilities combined with a vast distribution network. We are now a leading North American footwear and accessories designer, producer and retailer. We operate a portfolio of retail stores in over 650 locations in North America along with related e-commerce sites.
On May 10, 2018, we acquired the remaining interest in Town Shoes Limited ("TSL") that we did not previously own. TSL is a retailer of branded footwear in Canada, primarily under The Shoe Company, Shoe Warehouse, and DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse banners, as well as related e-commerce sites. Subsequent to the acquisition, and as a result of our strategic review, we exited TSL's Town Shoes banner during fiscal 2018. 
On November 5, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Camuto LLC, dba Camuto Group ("Camuto Group"), a footwear design and brand development organization, from Camuto Group LLC (the "Sellers"). The Camuto Group acquisition provides us a global production, sourcing and design infrastructure, including operations in Brazil and China, a new state-of-the-art distribution center in New Jersey, footwear licenses of brands, including Jessica Simpson and Lucky Brand, and branded e-commerce sites. Camuto Group earns revenue from the sale of wholesale products to retailers, commissions for serving retailers as the design and buying agent for products under private labels ("First Cost"), and the sale of branded products on direct-to-consumer e-commerce sites.
Additionally, in partnership with Authentic Brands Group LLC, a global brand management and marketing company, we formed ABG-Camuto, LLC ("ABG-Camuto"), a joint venture in which we have a 40% interest. This joint venture acquired several intellectual property rights from the Sellers, including Vince Camuto, Louise et Cie, Sole Society, CC Corso Como, Enzo Angiolini and others, and focuses on licensing and developing new category extensions to support the global growth of these brands. We have entered into a licensing agreement with ABG-Camuto whereby we pay royalties on our net sales from the brands owned by ABG-Camuto. 
Our Affiliated Business Group ("ABG") partners with other retailers to help build and optimize their in-store and online footwear businesses by leveraging our sourcing network to produce a merchandise assortment that meets their needs. ABG currently provides services to over 280 Stein Mart stores, Steinmart.com, and a Frugal Fannie's store through ongoing supply arrangements. 
On March 4, 2016, we acquired Ebuys, Inc. ("Ebuys"), an off-price footwear and accessories retailer operating in digital marketplaces. Due to recurring operating losses incurred by Ebuys since its acquisition, as well as increased competitive pressures in the digital marketplace, we decided to exit the business and ended all operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Our brief ownership has given us insight into online marketplaces, which will inform future potential decisions around accelerating our digital business and competing with traditional retail and direct-to-consumer models.
As a result of these acquisitions, we now present three reportable segments: the U.S. Retail segment, the Canada Retail segment, and the Brand Portfolio segment. The U.S. Retail segment, which was previously presented as the DSW segment, includes stores operated in the U.S. under the DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse banner and its related e-commerce site. The Canada Retail segment, which is the result of the TSL acquisition, includes stores operated in Canada under The Shoe Company, Shoe Warehouse, and DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse banners and related e-commerce sites. Together, the U.S. Retail and Canada Retail segments are referred to as the "retail segments." The Brand Portfolio segment, which is the result of the Camuto Group acquisition, includes sales from wholesale, First Cost, and direct-to-consumer e-commerce sites. Our other operating segments, ABG and Ebuys, are below the quantitative and qualitative thresholds for reportable segments and are aggregated into Other for segment reporting purposes. 
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. References to a fiscal year refer to the calendar year in which the fiscal year begins. This reporting schedule is followed by many national retail companies and typically results in a 52-week fiscal year, but occasionally will contain an additional week resulting in a 53-week fiscal year. The periods presented in these financial statements and selected financial data each consisted of 52 weeks, except for fiscal 2017 which consisted of 53 weeks.

Competition
The footwear market is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group of manufacturers and retailers, both small and large, including department stores, mall-based shoe stores, national chains, independent shoe retailers, single-brand specialty retailers, online shoe retailers, brand-oriented discounters, multi-channel specialty retailers and brand suppliers. In addition, our wholesale retailer customers sell shoes purchased from competing footwear suppliers with owned and licensed brands that are well-known. Many of these suppliers invest significantly in marketing their brands. In our retail segments, many of our competitors generally offer a more limited assortment at higher initial prices in a less convenient format than us and without the benefits of our customer loyalty programs. In addition, we believe we successfully compete against retailers who have attempted to duplicate our format because they typically offer assortments with fewer recognizable brands and more styles from prior seasons, unlike our current on-trend merchandise. We believe our stores provide a competitive advantage that drives growth through customer engagement by using self-service fixtures, stimulating digital sales, and providing a convenient location for customers to pick up and return products ordered online, as well as serving as geographically appropriate shipment centers for our digitally demanded products. In our Brand Portfolio segment, we compete primarily based on providing fashion-forward styles at high quality standards along with strong customer relationships.
Retail Segments
The following table presents the number of stores we operated as of February 2, 2019 by segment and by banner:

 | Stores
U.S. Retail segment - DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse | 516 
Canada Retail segment: | 
The Shoe Company / Shoe Warehouse | 112 
DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse | 27 
 | 139 
Total | 655 

Our growth strategy is to strengthen our position as a leading footwear and accessories retailer by expanding into new markets with the appropriate banners and store format, extending our customer reach through new categories and services, and creating a differentiated customer experience and strong value proposition. We also plan to continue utilizing our financial strength to invest in key initiatives that will strengthen our strategic position and extend our growth runway for years to come. We plan to expand the chain in North America by approximately three to eight stores, net of closures, in fiscal 2019. With our stores playing a key role in supporting our strong online demand growth and increasing fulfillment of that demand, we are regularly evaluating our real estate strategy to optimize how we can best serve the customers' shopping preferences. Our evaluation of potential new stores integrates information on demographics, co-tenancy, retail traffic patterns, site visibility and accessibility, store size and configuration, and lease terms. Our real estate decision-making entails an analysis of underlying demand for our products through both physical and digital channels. Our analysis also considers current penetration levels in markets we serve and our ability to deepen our market share and acquire new customers.
Banners
Our DSW banner stores, both in the U.S. and in Canada, are the destination for on-trend and fashion-forward footwear and accessory brands at a great value every single day. DSW stores tend to serve larger markets and average approximately 20,400 square feet. We offer a wide assortment of brand name dress, casual and athletic footwear and accessories for women, men and kids in stores and on e-commerce platforms. 
The Shoe Company and Shoe Warehouse banner stores located in Canada offer on-trend footwear and accessory brands that target every-day family styles at a great value every single day. The Shoe Company stores average approximately 6,300 square feet and Shoe Warehouse stores average approximately 3,800 square feet, with both being able to serve mid- to smaller markets. We offer a select assortment of brand name dress, casual and athletic footwear and accessories for women, men and kids in stores and on e-commerce platforms, with a significant number of our products geared towards athletic and kids.
Our strong retail market position with all of our banners is driven by our competitive strengths in assortment, convenience, and value as described in more detail below.

Assortment
Our goal is to excite our customers with a competitive, compelling assortment of shoes and complementary accessories that fulfill a broad range of style and fashion preferences. We sell a large assortment of brand name, designer and private brand merchandise. We purchase directly from over 580 domestic and foreign vendors, primarily in-season footwear that can be found in specialty and department stores. We offer a broad assortment of handbags, hosiery, jewelry and other accessories that appeal to our brand and fashion conscious customers. 
Our vendors include suppliers who manufacture their own merchandise, or supply merchandise manufactured by others, or both. Most of our domestic vendors import a large portion of their merchandise from abroad. We have quality control programs under which our buyers are involved in establishing standards for quality and fit, and we examine incoming merchandise in regards to color, material and overall quality. As our sales volume grows, we believe there will continue to be adequate sources available to acquire a sufficient supply of quality merchandise in a timely manner and on satisfactory economic terms. Our top three vendors in the aggregate supply approximately 20% of our retail merchandise.
Our merchandising group continuously monitors current fashion trends, as well as historical sales trends, to identify popular styles and styles that may become popular in the upcoming season. We track performance and sales trends on a weekly basis and have a flexible buying process that allows us to reorder successful styles and cancel under-performing styles throughout each season. To keep our product mix fresh and on target, we test new fashions and actively monitor sell-through rates. We also identify new vendor and product category opportunities. 
We separate our merchandise into three primary categories: women’s footwear, men’s footwear, and accessories and other (which includes kids’ footwear). The following table presents the percentages of the retail segments' total net sales attributable to each merchandise category for fiscal 2018: 

 | Percent of Total Net Sales
Women's footwear | 67 | %
Men's footwear | 21 | %
Accessories and other | 12 | %

Convenience
We provide our customers with the highest level of convenience based on our belief that customers should be empowered to control and personalize their shopping experiences. 
In stores, our merchandise is displayed on the selling floor with self-service fixtures to enable customers to view and touch the merchandise. We believe this shopping experience provides our customers with maximum convenience as they are able to browse and try on merchandise without feeling rushed or pressured to make a purchasing decision. Merchandise is organized in a logical manner that groups together similar styles by gender, such as dress, casual, athletic and seasonal merchandise, for easy browsing. 
Our omni-channel capabilities create an endless aisle for the customer. Customers can order additional styles, sizes, widths and categories. Online orders in the U.S. and Canada can be fulfilled from any one of our stores. Orders from the U.S. can also be fulfilled from our fulfillment center or directly from our suppliers (referred to as "drop ship"). To further meet customer demand of how they receive products, we provide our customers options to buy online, pickup in store and buy online, ship to store. 
Our order routing optimization system determines the best location to fulfill digitally demanded products, which allows us to optimize our operating profit. The fulfillment center processes U.S. orders, which are shipped to a customer's home or to a store when an order is placed through buy online, ship to store. Orders originating from a store that cannot be fulfilled immediately in that store can either be fulfilled from our ship from store capability, from the fulfillment center (in the U.S.), or drop shipped from a vendors' warehouse.
Value for Our Customers
Our buying organization aims to provide customers with high quality, in-season fashion styles at attractive prices compared to the sale prices found at specialty retailers and department stores. In addition, we provide additional value through our DSW VIP rewards program in the U.S. and our Shoe Lovers Rewards program in Canada where members earn points towards discounts

on future purchases. Members also receive promotional offers and gifts with purchase offers. We employ a variety of methods, including email, direct mail and social media, to communicate exclusive offers to our rewards members. We have approximately 30 million members enrolled in our loyalty programs who have made at least one purchase over the last two years. In fiscal 2018, shoppers in the loyalty programs generated approximately 88% of the combined U.S. Retail and Canada Retail segments' net sales. During fiscal 2018, DSW VIP was launched and replaced our previous loyalty program, with new benefits, personalized options and faster ways to earn points. We expect these changes will result in more customer activations, increase purchase frequency, and sales growth.
Brand Portfolio Segment
Our Brand Portfolio segment designs, develops and sources fashion footwear and accessories. We provide retailer customers and consumers a portfolio of licensed brands, including Vince Camuto, Louise et Cie, Sole Society, CC Corso Como, Enzo Angiolini, Jessica Simpson, Lucky Brand, and others. The Brand Portfolio segment earns revenue from the sale of wholesale products to retailers, First Cost commissions, and the sale of branded products on direct-to-consumer e-commerce sites, which include www.vincecamuto.com and www.solesociety.com. Wholesale retailer customers and First Cost customers include department stores, specialty stores, value priced retailers, national chains, and online retailers. 
We operate the Brand Portfolio segment as a separate and distinct business from the retail segments. The Brand Portfolio segment currently sells branded products to the retail segments. We plan to transition the sourcing of all of the retail segments' private label merchandise to the Brand Portfolio segment.
Product Design
We have established a reputation for quality, on-trend merchandise. Our design teams are responsible for the creation and development of new product styles by utilizing our proven design process. Our designers monitor trends in footwear and apparel and work closely with our retailer customers to identify consumer preferences. Our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to fashion trends, consumer preferences and changing customer expectations. We believe our design process provides us with a competitive advantage allowing us to mitigate the risk of incurring costs associated with the production and distribution of less desirable designs. 
Sourcing and Distribution
We source each of our product lines based on the individual design, style and quality specifications of the products. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities; rather, we use our sourcing offices to procure our products from independently-owned
manufacturers primarily in China and Brazil. We are able to achieve consistent quality, competitive prices and on-time delivery based on the established relationships we have with these manufacturers. Prior to production, our sourcing offices inspect samples and prototypes of each style and monitor the quality of the production process. The manufacturers of our products are required to meet our quality, human rights, safety and other standard requirements. 
We utilize a new state-of-the-art distribution center in New Jersey to receive, sort and distribute our products to retailer customers and to fulfill www.vincecamuto.com e-commerce orders. We also use a third-party distribution center in California to fulfill orders placed on www.solesociety.com. 
Backlog
As of February 2, 2019, we had a backlog of unfilled wholesale customer orders of $89.1 million. Most of these orders are for delivery over the next 180 days, and although orders are subject to cancellation, we have not experienced significant cancellations in the past. The backlog at any particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, the volume of customer e-commerce drop ship orders we fulfill, and the timing of wholesale customer purchases of our products through our replenishment program. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period may not be indicative of eventual shipments.

ABG-Camuto Joint Venture
ABG-Camuto will be responsible for the growth and marketing of the brands held by the joint venture. We pay royalties to ABG-Camuto, with the royalty expense included in cost of sales, based on the sales of footwear, handbags and jewelry. ABG-Camuto also earns royalties on sales from third-parties that license the brand names to produce non-footwear product categories. Given our 40% ownership interest in ABG-Camuto, we recognize earnings under the equity method, which will be included within the Brand Portfolio segment, as ABG-Camuto is considered an integral part of the Brand Portfolio segment business.
First Cost
As the design and buying agent for retailer customers, we utilize our expertise and relationships with manufacturers to facilitate the production of private label footwear to retailer customer specifications. Our First Cost model earns commission-based revenue while leveraging our overall design and sourcing infrastructure.
Additional Information
Intellectual Property
We have registered a number of trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States, Canada and internationally, including DSW®, DSW Shoe Warehouse® and DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse®. We also have a 40% interest in ABG-Camuto, which holds the intellectual property rights of Vince Camuto®, Louise et Cie®, Sole Society®, CC Corso Como®, Enzo Angiolini® and others. We have entered into a licensing agreement with ABG-Camuto whereby we pay royalties on our net sales from the brands owned by ABG-Camuto. We believe our trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to building our name recognition.

We vigorously protect our patented fixture designs, as well as our packaging, private brand names, store design elements, marketing slogans and graphics.
Associates
As of February 2, 2019, we employed approximately 16,100 associates worldwide. None of our associates are covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
