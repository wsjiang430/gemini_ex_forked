Overview
We are an arrhythmia management company focused on improving the way cardiac arrhythmias are diagnosed and treated. Despite several decades of effort by the incumbents in this field, the clinical and economic challenges associated with arrhythmia treatment continue to be a huge burden for patients, providers and payors. We are committed to advancing the field of electrophysiology with a unique array of products and technologies which will enable more physicians to treat more patients more effectively and efficiently. Through internal product development, acquisitions and global partnerships, we have established a global sales presence delivering a broad portfolio of highly differentiated electrophysiology products. Our goal is to provide our customers with a complete solution for catheter-based treatment of cardiac arrhythmias in each of our geographic markets.
We design, manufacture and market a range of tools for catheter-based ablation procedures to treat various arrhythmias. Cardiac ablation involves using high-energy radio frequency or extreme cold to target tissue in the heart that is responsible for triggering or sustaining an abnormal heart rhythm. Our product portfolio includes novel access sheaths, diagnostic and mapping catheters, conventional and contact force ablation catheters (currently available only in our European markets), mapping and imaging consoles and accessories, as well as supporting algorithms and software programs. Our foundational and most highly differentiated product is our AcQMap imaging and mapping system, which offers a paradigm-shifting approach to mapping the drivers and maintainers of arrhythmias with unmatched speed and precision. With the ability to rapidly and accurately identify ablation targets and to confirm both ablation success and procedural completion, we believe our AcQMap System addresses the primary unmet need in electrophysiology procedures today.
While multiple trials have established that cardiac ablation is effective when the source of the arrhythmia is accurately identified and successfully ablated, visualization of various complex arrhythmias and creation of durable ablation lesions remains challenging with long, unpredictable procedure times and inconsistent outcomes. For example, data from large, multi-center trials of cardiac ablation have demonstrated that approximately 30 to 50% of ablations for atrial fibrillation result in arrhythmia recurrence within the first 12 months of the initial ablation procedure. Currently marketed mapping systems are not able to quickly and consistently identify the source of the arrhythmia in more complex cases, which can contribute to these unsatisfactory outcomes. Current competitive mapping systems sequentially collect data point-by-point by contacting the heart surface at multiple locations throughout the chamber. This is a time-consuming process that often takes 15 to 20 minutes per map. Additionally, because contact-based mapping relies on a fixed timing reference to sequence the data points, it precludes these systems from being able to quickly and reliably identify the drivers and maintainers of unstable arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, many types of supraventricular tachycardias and certain ventricular arrhythmias.
We designed our AcQMap System to improve procedure efficiency and outcomes by rapidly and accurately identifying ablation targets and confirming both ablation success and procedure completion. Our AcQMap System consists of our single-use AcQMap catheter as well as our console, workstation and proprietary software algorithms. With 48 ultrasound transducers interspersed between 48 biopotential electrodes, our innovative mapping catheter collects the data required to create a comprehensive map of the cardiac anatomy and electrical propagation pathways and patterns in under three minutes without contacting the chamber wall. Our proprietary software algorithms analyze the biopotential data and are collectively able to map any type of stable or unstable arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation as well as all supraventricular tachycardias and ventricular arrhythmias.
We believe that by creating high definition, clinically accurate activation maps of all types of arrhythmias, our AcQMap System offers physicians better decision-making tools to determine where to ablate. Similarly, we believe the speed and ease of creating a map makes it practical for physicians to iteratively map, treat, re-map and adjust additional therapy if and when needed. In the second half of 2022, we received U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, clearance and Conformité Européenne Mark, or CE Mark, for our AcQMap 8.5 software platform. This release provided significant enhancements to our industry-unique non-contact ultrasound-based anatomical reconstruction. AcQMap anatomies are now higher fidelity and easier to create in less time. AcQMap 8.5 also provided additional workflow enhancements and troubleshooting tools to ensure cases could be run more efficiently. 
We have established a broad portfolio of electrophysiology products that complements our AcQMap System. In addition to our AcQMap System, our commercial product portfolio includes a suite of access devices and full product lines of diagnostic and, in our European markets, ablation catheters. In our European markets, our portfolio provides our customers with a complete solution—from vascular access to diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias. In the United States, we are currently seeking 
regulatory approval, for which we filed in 2022, for our ablation catheters to complement our portfolio of access and mapping devices. We also recently expanded our portfolio to include the AcQBlate® FORCE gold-tip, irrigated, radiofrequency force sensing ablation catheters and Qubic Force control unit, or AcQBlate Force Sensing Ablation System, which we commercialized following the December 2020 receipt of CE Mark approval in Europe. Biotronik SE & Co. KG, or Biotronik, had previously performed the BioConcept Study, which was used as the base data for CE Mark submission, and no additional clinical data was required for CE Mark approval. We also completed the AcQForce Flutter investigational device exemption, or IDE, trial for U.S. Food and Drug Administration Premarket Approval, or FDA PMA, in the United States during 2022 to seek a right atrial typical flutter indication. We currently anticipate FDA PMA and the U.S. commercial launch of our AcQBlate Force Sensing Ablation System in the second half of 2023. We will pursue CE Mark for our PFA system following the completion of the trial and satisfactory preparation of regulatory submission documents. We believe that our ability to offer a broad and differentiated product portfolio will support the adoption and utilization of our AcQMap System and drive an efficient business model. Once an AcQMap console and workstation is established in a customer account, our revenue from that account becomes predominantly recurring in nature and derived from the sale of our portfolio of disposable products used with our system.
We market and sell our electrophysiology products worldwide to hospitals and electrophysiologists that treat patients with arrhythmias. We have strategically developed a direct selling presence in the United States and select markets in Western Europe where cardiac ablation is a standard of care and third-party reimbursement is well-established. In other international markets, we leverage our partnership with Biotronik, a large multi-national, privately-held biomedical technology company with a leading portfolio across cardiac rhythm management, electrophysiology and vascular intervention, to sell and distribute our products. In the United States and Western Europe, our target market is highly concentrated. We plan to leverage the concentrated nature of procedure volumes and the recurring nature of our sales to drive an increasingly efficient commercial model.
Our research and development activities are focused on advancing the field of electrophysiology by increasing the AcQMap System’s utility and by seeking approval for additional labeled indications as well as by expanding our product portfolio to further improve and simplify the entire procedural experience. Our near-term pipeline includes products that broaden our clinical utility, improve the system’s workflow and user experience, and increase functionality and/or reduce costs across catheters, accessory devices, mapping systems and software.
Our Market and Industry
Cardiac arrhythmias, or heart rhythm disorders, are common and can occur when the heart beats too rapidly, too slowly or irregularly. If left untreated, arrhythmias can result in debilitating symptoms, heart failure, stroke and sudden cardiac death. 
Atrial fibrillation, or AF, is the most common arrhythmia and is characterized by rapid and irregular activation of the heart. This irregular behavior increases the potential to develop blood clots within the upper chambers of the heart, which can then circulate to other organs, leading to reduced blood flow and strokes. We estimate that there were approximately 624,000 cardiac ablation procedures globally for atrial fibrillation in 2021.
Supraventricular tachycardias, or SVTs, are characterized by a rapid heartbeat in the upper chambers of the heart. These arrhythmias, which include atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia, among others, can arise organically or as a result of an incomplete ablation for atrial fibrillation. These post AF ablation SVT procedures are considered to be “complex” SVT ablation procedures. We estimate there were approximately 494,000 ablation procedures worldwide for SVTs in 2021. Moreover, the number of SVT procedures that fall under the complex category are expected to grow as a result of growth in AF ablation procedures.
Ventricular arrhythmias affect the lower chambers of the heart and consist primarily of ventricular tachycardias, or VTs, and premature ventricular contractions, or PVCs. If left untreated, VTs and PVCs can lead to heart failure, ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. We estimate that there were approximately 116,000 ablation procedures globally for ventricular arrhythmias in 2021. 
Currently marketed mapping systems rely on tissue contact and a fixed timing reference to collect and align data in the proper sequence. As a result, they are designed to map simple, stable and repetitive arrhythmias such as certain SVTs and VTs. Collecting a critical mass of data points to see even a stable rhythm is time consuming with contact mapping technologies, as data collection is sequential and by definition requires contact at all areas to fully map the heart. This time consuming, sequential data collection results in significant variability in the map quality and therefore the diagnostic relevance of the map in guiding therapy. Innovation in contact mapping systems therefore have been limited to enabling faster data collection via adding more sensors to contact mapping catheters. In addition, these technologies are not capable of mapping unstable or 
complex arrhythmias such as AF, certain VTs, PVCs or many types of SVTs, thereby generating an unmet need in the market for effective diagnostic and treatment alternatives.
Our Solution
We design, manufacture and market a range of tools for catheter-based ablation procedures to treat various arrhythmias. Our foundational and most highly differentiated product is our AcQMap imaging and mapping system which offers a non-contact map paradigm-shifting approach to mapping the drivers and maintainers of arrhythmias with unmatched speed and precision. With the ability to rapidly and accurately identify ablation targets and to confirm both ablation success and procedural completion, we believe our AcQMap System addresses the primary unmet need in electrophysiology procedures today.
Overview of Our AcQMap System
We developed our AcQMap System to address the key challenges that electrophysiologists face during ablation procedures and remove the barriers to adopting ablation for complex arrhythmia procedures.
Our AcQMap System consists of our AcQMap catheter, console and workstation. Our system uses a paradigm-shifting approach. With 48 ultrasound transducers interspersed between 48 biopotential electrodes, our innovative mapping catheter collects the data required to create a comprehensive map of the cardiac anatomy and electrical propagation patterns and pathways without contacting the chamber wall. This allows us to create comprehensive diagnostic maps of the chamber anatomy and electrical propagation patterns and pathways in under three minutes. Our proprietary software algorithms analyze the biopotential data and are collectively able to map any type of stable or unstable arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation, as well as all supraventricular tachycardias and ventricular arrhythmias. Our AcQMap 8.5 software platform, which we introduced in the second half of 2022, offers significant enhancements to our industry unique non-contact ultrasound-based anatomical reconstruction enabling higher fidelity anatomies to be created in less time. 
Key Benefits of AcQMap
We believe the unique attributes of our AcQMap System offer significant clinical benefits relative to the current standard of care.
Iterative Whole-Chamber Mapping Approach
With increased mapping speed and precision, electrophysiologists are empowered in real time to iteratively map, treat, re-map and adjust additional therapy as needed. This allows physicians to determine when ablation is complete, which we believe will drive more efficient and predictable procedures and better outcomes for a broader range of arrhythmias.
Increased Mapping Accuracy
Ultrasound technology allows us to create an anatomically accurate image of the heart chamber, and non-contact charge density mapping provides a more localized and sharper view of cardiac activation resulting in images with four times higher resolution than voltage-based maps produced by currently marketed contact-based mapping systems. We believe the combination of these two features allows electrophysiologists to reliably identify and ablate the source of the arrhythmia, which will help improve clinical outcomes and reduce the need for repeat procedures.
Ability to Identify Multiple Complex Arrhythmias
The AcQMap System is the only commercially available mapping system that can quickly and reliably map both stable and unstable rhythms, allowing electrophysiologists to see changes in conduction during the procedure and providing them with an optimal solution to better customize therapy.
Demonstrated Clinical Outcomes
Our UNCOVER AF post-market approval trial, which assessed the effectiveness of the AcQMap System in identifying patient-specific targets for ablation, demonstrated favorable freedom from AF outcomes. The results are particularly favorable in the context of other landmark trials in the electrophysiology space, including the STAR AF II trial, which evaluated a similar population of persistent AF patients. We believe the key differentiator in outcomes was the use of our AcQMap System to map and identify key ablation patterns and targets.
Our Broad Portfolio
We have established a broad portfolio of electrophysiology products that complements our AcQMap System. In addition to our AcQMap System, our commercial product portfolio includes a suite of access devices and full product lines of diagnostic and, in our European markets, ablation catheters. In our European markets, our portfolio provides our customers with a complete solution—from vascular access to diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias. In the United States, we are currently seeking regulatory approval for our ablation catheters to complement our portfolio of access and mapping devices. We also recently expanded our portfolio to include the AcQBlate Force Sensing Ablation System, which we launched following the December 2020 receipt of CE Mark approval in Europe. We completed our IDE trial and filed for FDA PMA in the United States in 2022. We currently anticipate FDA PMA and the U.S. commercial launch of our AcQBlate Force Sensing Ablation Catheter and System in the second half of 2023.
We believe that our ability to offer a broad and differentiated product portfolio will support the adoption and utilization of our AcQMap System and drive an efficient business model. Once an AcQMap console and workstation is established in a customer account, our revenue from that account becomes predominantly recurring in nature and derived from the sale of our portfolio of disposable products used with our system.
Our Growth Strategies
We are committed to advancing the field of electrophysiology with a unique array of products and technologies which will enable more physicians to treat more patients more efficiently and effectively. We seek to establish our AcQMap System as the standard of care for mapping and diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias and to leverage its paradigm-shifting nature to drive adoption and utilization of our portfolio of differentiated electrophysiology products.
Our growth strategies include:
•utilizing our superior mapping technology and open platform to establish our presence within a geographically targeted base of customer accounts and physicians;
•strategically positioning our commercial organization across targeted geographic regions to increase physician awareness and drive adoption;
•maximizing console utilization and procedure volume growth in targeted geographic regions;
•continuing to strategically expand our portfolio of products and broaden indications for existing products;
•leveraging our strategic partnerships to efficiently scale globally and broaden our product portfolio; and
•continuing to build our clinical evidence base.
Impact of COVID-19
The markets we serve could see continued impacts from COVID-19 for the foreseeable future, and the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 creates significant uncertainty as to how long COVID-19 will continue to impact our business. The magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our productivity, results of operations and financial position and its disruption to our business and our clinical programs and timelines will depend, in part, on the length and severity of outbreaks, restrictions and other measures designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and on our ability to conduct business in the ordinary course.
Corporate Restructuring
In 2022, we completed an organizational workforce reduction and implemented additional cost reduction measures to reduce our operating expenses and optimize our cash resources. The restructuring was the result of a detailed review of our strategic priorities, the external environment and cost structure, and is intended to sharpen our focus and strengthen our financial position. As part of the restructuring, we intend to prioritize maximizing console utilization and procedure volume growth in targeted geographic regions, as well as a more focused scope of product development initiatives. 
Competition
The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We compete with manufacturers and distributors of cardiovascular medical devices. Our most significant competitors in the electrophysiology field include Abbott Laboratories, 
Biosense Webster Inc. (a Johnson & Johnson Company), Boston Scientific Corporation and Medtronic, Inc. ("Medtronic"). Many of our competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and resources than we have. Therefore, they can spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. We also compete with smaller medical device companies that have a single product or a limited range of products. Some of our competitors have:
•significantly greater name recognition;
•broader or deeper relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors;
•more established distribution networks;
•additional lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage;
•greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products; and
•greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent prosecution.
We believe that our proprietary AcQMap System offers a paradigm-shifting approach to mapping the drivers and maintainers of arrhythmias with unmatched speed and precision. With the ability to rapidly and accurately identify ablation targets and to confirm both ablation success and procedural completion, we believe our AcQMap System addresses the primary unmet need in electrophysiology procedures today. We have established a broad portfolio of electrophysiology products that complements our AcQMap System. We compete primarily on the basis that our products are designed to enable more physicians to treat more patients more efficiently and effectively. Our continued success depends on our ability to:
•strategically develop innovative proprietary products that address significant clinical needs in a manner that is safe and effective for patients and easy-to-use for physicians;
•obtain and maintain regulatory clearances or approvals;
•demonstrate safety and effectiveness in our sponsored and third-party clinical trials;
•expand our sales force within key geographic regions to increase physician awareness;
•leverage our strategic partnerships and alliances to achieve distribution at a global scale and broaden our product portfolio;
•obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for procedures using our products;
•attract and retain skilled research, development, sales and clinical personnel;
•cost-effectively manufacture, market and sell our products; and
•obtain, maintain, enforce and defend our intellectual property rights and operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others.

Manufacturing and Supply
We currently manufacture our novel access sheaths, transseptal crossing tools, diagnostic and mapping catheters, ablation catheters, mapping and imaging consoles and accessories at our approximately 50,800 square foot facility in Carlsbad, California. This facility provides approximately 15,750 square feet of space for our production and distribution operations, including manufacturing, quality control and storage. We believe our existing facility is sufficient to meet our current manufacturing needs and we believe that adequate additional space will be available if we require it.
We stock inventory of raw materials, components and finished goods at our facility in Carlsbad and, to a limited extent, with our sales representatives who travel to our hospital customers’ locations as part of their sales efforts. We rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and components, and we generally have no long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers, as we generally order on a purchase order basis. Furthermore, we rely on third parties to manufacture certain products we offer our customers as part of our product portfolio, including Biotronik for diagnostic and ablation catheters, RF generators and irrigation pumps, and MedFact Engineering GmbH for robotic navigation enabled ablation catheters.
In conjunction with the Asset Purchase Agreement (as defined below), we executed a distribution agreement with Medtronic (the "Distribution Agreement"), pursuant to which we manufacture and supply the Products (as defined below) to Medtronic as exclusive distributor of the product line for up to the next four years. 
Our manufacturing and distribution operations are subject to regulatory requirements of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, for medical devices sold in the United States, set forth in 21 CFR part 820, and the European Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC and amendments, or MDD, and the products comply to ISO 13485 for manufacturing for medical devices marketed in the European Union. In addition, the Carlsbad facility is licensed by the California Food and Drug Branch. We are also subject to applicable local regulations relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal, sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and remediation of hazardous substances.
Government Regulation
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Our products and operations are subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export, and post-marketing surveillance.
Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the FDCA such as provisions that relate to adulteration, misbranding, registration and listing, notification, including repair, replacement, or refund, records and reports and good manufacturing practices. Most Class I devices are classified as exempt from premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, and therefore may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Class II devices are subject to both general controls and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries and guidance documents. A manufacturer may be required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute some Class II devices. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. A Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA 
approves the device after submission of a PMA application. However, there are some Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet called for a PMA. For these devices, the manufacturer must submit a premarket notification and obtain 510(k) clearance in order to commercially distribute these devices. The FDA can also impose sales, marketing or other restrictions on devices in order to assure that they are used in a safe and effective manner.
The Investigational Device Process
In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an IDE application. Some types of trials deemed to present “non-significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed, and institutional review board, or IRB, approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the trial protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate IRBs at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and effectiveness, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of trial sponsors and trial investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s good clinical practice regulations for IRB approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and effectiveness success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product.
The 510(k) Clearance Process
When a 510(k) clearance is required, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. By regulation, a premarket notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 90 days before intent to market the device, and 510(k) clearance must be received from the FDA prior to marketing the device. The Medical Device User Fee Amendments performance goals for a traditional 510(k) clearance is 90 days. As a practical matter, however, clearance often takes longer, because the review clock is paused by the FDA to allow time to resolve any questions the FDA may have on the 510(k). To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics or different technological characteristics, and the information in the premarket notification demonstrates that the device is equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The FDA may require further information including clinical data to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, the FDA will place the device into Class III.
There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional, special and abbreviated. Special 510(k)s are typically for devices that are modified and the results of change evaluation can be sufficiently reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format. Abbreviated 510(k)s are for devices that conform to special controls for the device type or to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review, and the FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt.
The PMA Process
A PMA application under section 515 of the FDCA must be submitted to the FDA for Class III devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The PMA application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA is based on a determination by the FDA that the PMA application contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).
After a PMA application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can 
take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to the FDA’s overall decision making process. In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with QSR. The FDA also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with the FDA’s regulations.
Upon completion of the PMA application review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates the FDA’s belief that the PMA application is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA’s review clock is reset.
Pervasive and Continuing Regulation
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including their suppliers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;
•medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
•medical device recalls, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA any recall of a medical device, provided the recall was initiated to either reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health; and
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
We have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained a manufacturing license from the California Department of Public Health, or CDPH. The FDA and CDPH have broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of CDPH to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. Additionally, our Notified Body, DQS-MED, regularly inspects our manufacturing, design and operational facilities to ensure ongoing ISO 13485 compliance in order to maintain our CE Mark.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and
•criminal prosecution.
Export of Our Products
Export of products subject to the 510(k) notification requirements, but not yet cleared to market, is permitted with FDA authorization provided certain requirements are met. Unapproved or uncleared products subject to the PMA requirements may 
be exported if the exporting company and the device meet certain criteria, including, among other things, that the device complies with the laws of the receiving country and has valid marketing authorization from the appropriate authority and that the company submits a “Simple Notification” to the FDA when it begins to export. Importantly, however, export of such products may be limited to certain countries designated by statutory provisions, and petitions may need to be submitted to the FDA to enable export to countries other than those designated in the statutory provisions. The petitioning process can be difficult, and the FDA may not authorize unapproved or uncleared products to be exported to countries to which a manufacturer wishes to export. Devices that are adulterated, devices whose label and labeling does not comply with requirements of the country receiving the product, and devices that are not promoted in accordance with the law of the receiving country, among others, cannot be exported.
Foreign Government Regulation
The regulatory review process for medical devices varies from country to country, and many countries also impose product standards, packaging requirements, environmental requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties, and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject a company to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, criminal prosecution or other consequences.
European Union
Our portfolio of products is regulated in the European Union as a medical device per either the Medical Device Directive (MDD) or the Medical Device Regulations (MDR). The MDD and MDR set out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the European Union. The system of regulating medical devices operates by way of a certification for each medical device. Each certified device is marked with the CE Mark which shows that the device has a Certificat de Conformité. There are national bodies known as Competent Authorities in each member state which oversee the implementation of the regulations within their jurisdiction. The means for achieving the requirements for the CE Mark vary according to the nature of the device. Devices are classified in accordance with their perceived risks. The class of a product determines the conformity assessment required before the CE Mark can be placed on a product. Conformity assessments for our products were previously carried out as required by the MDD and are now performed in accordance with the MDR. Each member state can appoint Notified Bodies within its jurisdiction. If a Notified Body of one member state has issued a Certificat de Conformité, the device can be sold throughout the European Union without further conformance tests being required in other member states. The CE Mark is contingent upon continued compliance with the applicable regulations and the quality system requirements of the ISO 13485 standard. Our current CE Marks are issued by DQS-MED (Frankfurt, Germany).
After the product has received the CE Mark and been placed on the market in the European Economic Area, or EEA, a manufacturer must comply with a number of regulatory requirements relating to:
•registration of medical devices in individual EEA countries;
•pricing and reimbursement of medical devices;
•establishment of post-marketing surveillance and adverse event reporting procedures;
•field safety corrective actions, including product recalls and withdrawals; and
•interactions with physicians.
Other International Laws
In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences in the form of criminal penalties and significant fines for individuals or companies committing a bribery offense.
Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
For instance, in the United Kingdom, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 covers both public and private sector bribery, and prohibits the offer, provision or promise to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform their relevant functions or activities including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. An individual found in violation of the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 faces imprisonment of up to ten years. In addition, individuals can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information, including health information. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, imposes stringent data protection requirements, including, for example, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to special categories of data, such as health data, and additional obligations regarding third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States and other third countries. In addition, the GDPR provides that European Union member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data, including genetic, biometric or health data. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
Domestic Government Regulation
In the United States, there are local, state and national laws, directives and regulations that apply to the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information, including health information. For more information regarding the risks related to privacy laws that apply to us, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Products—We are subject to stringent privacy laws, information security policies and contractual obligations governing the use, processing and cross-border transfer of personal information and our data privacy and security policies.”
California Consumer Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General may bring enforcement actions for violations beginning July 1, 2020. The CCPA has been amended from time to time, and a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which mostly took effect on January 1, 2023, significantly modified the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. It remains unclear what, if any, further modifications will be made to the CCPA or CPRA, or how such legislation will be interpreted.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information.
U.S. Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
The federal and state governments have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to address fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. Violations of such laws could result in significant civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Anti-Kickback Statutes
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, subject to certain safe harbors, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, or for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term “remuneration” expressly includes kickbacks, bribes or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include 
anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act which is discussed below. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. Various states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state laws may be broader in scope in that some of these state laws extend to all payors and may not contain safe harbors. In addition, many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have similar laws and regulations.
Federal False Claims Act
The U.S. federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim, or the knowing use of false statements, to obtain payment from or approval by the federal government. Suits filed under the federal civil False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a case brought under the federal civil False Claim Act. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have adopted laws similar to the federal civil False Claims Act, and many of these state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors and, therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal government.
Civil Monetary Penalties
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, are for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Open Payments
The Affordable Care Act also includes a provision, commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act, which requires that any manufacturer of a covered device that provides payment or other transfer of value to a physician or teaching hospital, or to a third party at the request of a physician or teaching hospital, must submit to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information about the payment or other transfer of value annually, with the reported information to be made public on a searchable website.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign government official, political party or candidate for the purpose of improperly influencing any act or decision of a foreign government entity to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange in the United States to comply with accounting provisions which require the maintenance of books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
U.S. Health Reform
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenue and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future products. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts our industry. The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy 
makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
The implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and has affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The Affordable Care Act provides incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research and implements payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. We do not yet know the full impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on our business. There have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect additional challenges and amendments in the future.
On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and held oral arguments on November 10, 2020. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to CMS payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which was signed into law in March 2020 and is designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced CMS payments to several providers including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
We believe that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the rates we will be able to charge for our current and future products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future products from governmental agencies or third-party payors. Current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In both U.S. and non-U.S. markets, our ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our products depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental payors (such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States), managed care organizations and private health insurers. Third-party payors decide which treatments they will cover and establish reimbursement rates for those treatments. Third-party payors in the United States generally do not provide reimbursement for our products. Rather, we expect certain components of our AcQMap System to continue to be purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from third-party payors for the procedures performed using our products. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many international markets, a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Further, many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures. In most markets there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems. While third-party payors currently cover and provide reimbursement for procedures using our currently cleared or approved products, third-party payor reimbursement policies may change in the future.
Third-party payors are increasingly examining the cost effectiveness of products, in addition to their safety and efficacy, when making coverage and payment decisions. Third-party payors have also instituted initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs using, for example, price regulation or controls and competitive pricing programs. Some third-party payors also require demonstrated superiority, on the basis of randomized clinical trials, or pre-approval of coverage, for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures. Additionally, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for procedures that utilize one or more products for which we receive regulatory clearance and approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. It is uncertain whether our current products or any planned or future products will be viewed as sufficiently cost effective to warrant coverage and adequate reimbursement levels for procedures using such products.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company
We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible for exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and an exemption from the requirements to obtain a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
In addition, an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this provision of the JOBS Act. As a result, we will not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Therefore, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (i) December 31, 2025; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion; (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year; or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.
