     ITEM 1.  BUSINESS. 
     Overview
     Vista Gold Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Vista,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) operate in the gold mining industry. We are focused on the evaluation, acquisition, exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects, which may lead to gold production or value adding strategic transactions such as earn-in right agreements, option agreements, leases to third parties, joint venture arrangements with other mining companies, or outright sales of assets for cash and/or other consideration.  We look for opportunities to improve the value of our gold projects through exploration drilling and/or technical studies focused on optimizing previous engineering work. We do not currently generate cash flows from mining operations.
     The Company’s flagship asset is its 100% owned Mt Todd gold project (“Mt Todd”) in the Northern Territory (“NT”) Australia. Mt Todd is the largest undeveloped gold project in Australia. In January 2018, the Company received authorization for the last major environmental permit and we announced the positive results of an updated preliminary feasibility study (the “PFS”) for Mt Todd. Subsequently, Vista has completed additional metallurgical testing, including ongoing fine grinding evaluations, which demonstrate further improvements in gold recovery. With these important milestones and subsequent project improvements complete, Vista is in a better position to identify and pursue those strategic alternatives that may provide the best opportunity for shareholders to realize fair value for Mt Todd. We also hold 7.8 million of the outstanding common shares in the capital of Midas Gold Corp. (“Midas Gold Shares”), a non-core project in Mexico and royalty interests in the United States and Indonesia.
     Vista was originally incorporated on November 28, 1983 under the name “Granges Exploration Ltd.” It amalgamated with Pecos Resources Ltd. during June 1985 and continued as Granges Exploration Ltd.  In June 1989, Granges Exploration Ltd. changed its name to Granges Inc.  Granges Inc. amalgamated with Hycroft Resources & Development Corporation during May 1995 and continued as Granges Inc. Effective November 1996, Da Capo Resources Ltd. and Granges, Inc. amalgamated under the name “Vista Gold Corp.” and, effective December 1997, Vista continued from British Columbia to the Yukon Territory, Canada under the Business Corporations Act (Yukon Territory).  On June 11, 2013, Vista continued from the Yukon Territory, Canada to the Province of British Columbia, Canada under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).

 Corporate Organization Chart 
     The name, place of incorporation, continuance or organization and percent of equity securities that we own or control as of February 6, 2019 for each of our subsidiaries is set out below.      Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we had 14 full-time and no part-time employees globally. In addition, we use consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of our project evaluation, due diligence, corporate governance and property management.     Geographic and Segment Information
     We have one reportable segment, consisting of evaluation, acquisition and exploration activities which are focused principally in Australia.  We evaluate, acquire, explore and advance gold exploration and potential development projects, which may lead to gold production or value adding strategic transactions.   We reported no operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Geographic location of mineral properties and plant and equipment is provided in Notes 4 – Mineral Properties and 5 – Plant and Equipment to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the section heading “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.     Reclamation
     We generally will be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts would be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
     The Mt Todd site was not reclaimed when the mine closed in the late 1990’s.  Liability for the reclamation of the environmental conditions existing prior to Vista’s involvement with the project remains the responsibility of the NT Government until 30 days after we have provided notice to the NT Government that we intend to take over and assume the management, operation and rehabilitation of Mt Todd.  Vista does not expect to give such notice until a production decision has been made, the project is fully permitted to construct the mine, and the necessary financing for project construction has been arranged.

     In 2016, the Province of British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines (“MEM”) requested that the Company prepare and present to MEM a reclamation plan for closure and abandonment of certain mining claims in British Columbia which the Company had disposed of in 1996. Vista has presented a reclamation plan to MEM, however, execution of the reclamation plan has not started, as acceptance by MEM is pending. Assuming no other potentially responsible parties are identified and based on preliminary estimates of the reclamation and other related costs, we have accrued $242 as of December 31, 2018.
     Government Regulation
     Our exploration and development activities and other property interests are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in Australia and other jurisdictions, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and other programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. With the exception of the British Columbia claims noted above, management of the Company is not aware of any current orders or directions relating to the Company with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.      Australia Laws 
     Mineral projects in the NT are subject to Australian federal and NT laws and regulations regarding environmental matters and the discharge of hazardous wastes and materials. As with all mining projects, Mt Todd would be expected to have a variety of environmental impacts should development proceed. In Australia, environmental legislation plays a significant role in the mining industry. We are required under Australian laws and regulations (federal, state and territorial) to acquire permits and other authorizations before Mt Todd can be developed and mined. In September 2014, the EIS for Mt Todd was approved.  The Environmental Protection Agency of the Northern Territory Government (“NTEPA”) advised that it had assessed the environmental impacts of the Mt Todd gold mine and authorized the Company to proceed with the development of Mt Todd, subject to a number of recommendations which are outlined in the assessment report (the “Assessment Report”), particularly, a request for authorization under the federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (“EPBC”) as it relates to the Gouldian Finch. In January 2018, the authorization under the EPBC was approved by the Australia Department of the Environment and Energy. We must comply with the terms of our Authority Certificate under the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989 which deals with the handling of archeological material within sacred sites. We are also subject to statutory requirements under the Mining Management Act, which includes the requirement to complete a Mine Management Plan (“MMP”) before the start of mining operations. The Mt Todd MMP was formally submitted in November 2018, and is under review by the NT Department of Primary Industries and Resources.     Environmental Regulation
     Our projects are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. Our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
     Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, or what additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
     During 2018, none of our project sites had any material non-compliance occurrences with any applicable environmental regulations.  See “Item 1. Business - Reclamation” above.

 Competition
     We compete with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition, exploration, financing and development of gold properties. There is competition among mining companies for a limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities. Some of these competing mining companies have substantially greater financial and technical resources than Vista. As a result, we may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices. We compete with other mining companies to retain expert consultants required to complete our geological and project development studies.  We also compete with other mining companies to hire mining engineers, geologists and other skilled personnel in the mining industry, and for exploration and development services.     Gold Price History
     The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global gold demand and political and economic conditions.
     The following table presents the high, low and average afternoon fixed prices in U.S. dollars for an ounce of gold on the London Bullion Market over the past five years:
    
Year | High | | Low | Average
2014 | | 1,385 | | 1,142 | 1,266
2015 | | 1,296 | | 1,049 | 1,160
2016 | | 1,366 | | 1,077 | 1,251
2017 | | 1,346 | | 1,151 | 1,257
2018 | | 1,355 | | 1,178 | 1,269
