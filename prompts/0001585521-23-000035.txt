Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our mission is to make communications frictionless and secure.
Zoom enables people to connect to others, share ideas, make plans, and build toward a future limited only by their imagination. Our frictionless communications and collaboration platform started with video as its foundation, and we have set the standard for innovation ever since. That is why Zoom is an intuitive, scalable, and secure choice for large enterprises, small businesses, and individuals alike. We provide a unified communications and collaboration platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people interact, connecting them through frictionless and secure meetings, phone, chat, content sharing and more. Our Developer Platform enables customers, developers, and service providers to easily build apps and integrations on top of Zoom’s industry-leading video communications and collaboration platform, with opportunities for global discovery and distribution. Our virtual and hybrid event solutions allow users to seamlessly create and manage engaging events. 
Our cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-quality video and voice solutions that are easy to use, manage, and deploy; provides an attractive return on investment; and is scalable and easily integrates with physical spaces and applications. As businesses around the world navigate a period of significant work transformation, Zoom’s ability to enable meaningful connections whether teams are in the office, at home, on-the-go, or in other locations such as a retail or manufacturing setting, is a critical differentiator. We believe that rich and reliable communications lead to interactions that build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the trust our customers place in us by delivering a communications solution that is secure, reliable, and “just works.” 
A cornerstone of our platform is Zoom Meetings, around which we provide a full suite of products and features designed to give users an easy, reliable, and innovative unified communications experience. Users comprise both hosts, who organize video meetings, and individual attendees, who participate in those video meetings. In 2019, we launched Zoom Phone, a cloud-based PBX system, creating a unique unified communications and collaboration platform. Many customers also choose to implement Zoom Rooms, our software-based conference room system, which enables users to easily experience Zoom Meetings in their physical meeting spaces. 
We continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform. For example, during fiscal year 2023 we announced Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel contact center solution that is optimized for video and integrated right into the same Zoom experience as well as Zoom Whiteboard, a persistent whiteboard tool for team collaboration in and outside of meetings and Zoom IQ for Sales, a conversation intelligence software for Zoom Meetings, which provides sales teams with meaningful and actionable insights from their customer interactions to improve seller performance and enhance customer experiences. As of February 2023, Zoom Mail and Calendar are generally available, which include both client experiences (Zoom Mail Client, Zoom Calendar Client) and service components (Zoom Mail Service, Zoom Calendar Service). Lastly, we launched Zoom Virtual Agent, an AI-powered chatbot that understands customer questions and provides accurate answers quickly.
The happiness we bring is recognized by customers. Zoom has consistently high scores across customer review sites, including Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, and G2 Crowd, including being recognized as a 2022 Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice for Meeting Solutions as well as for Zoom Rooms and Zoom Video Webinars and a TrustRadius Top Rated Web Conferencing Software award along with nine other recognitions. Industry analysts also recognize our market leadership: Gartner has named Zoom a leader in the Magic Quadrant for UCaaS for the third year in a row. Frost & Sullivan recognized Zoom with its 2022 North American Virtual Care Customer Value Leadership Award as well as its 2022 Global SMB Customer Experience Customer Value Leadership Award. In 2022, we were also recognized as a leader in two IDC MarketScapes for Collaboration Tools in Education (North America and Worldwide). In addition, IDC recognized Zoom as a leader in the 2022 APAC Team Collaboration and Videoconferencing MarketScape. Zoom also received Leader recognition in two Aragon Research Globes: Unified Communications and Collaboration as well as Video Conferencing. We also received Aragon’s Innovation Award for Video Conferencing for the third year in a row (2020, 2021 and 2022). Zoom was also named to Fortune’s 2023 Most Admired Companies list for the second year in a row, and Fast Company’s 2022 Next Big Things in Tech list highlighted Zoom Events.
We have a unique model that combines viral enthusiasm for our platform with a multipronged go-to-market strategy for optimal efficiency. Viral enthusiasm begins with our users as they experience the simplicity and reliability of our platform – it “gets out of the way” so they can focus on what they need to get done together. This enthusiasm continues as meeting participants become paid hosts and as businesses of all sizes become our customers. Our sales efforts funnel this viral demand into routes-to-market that are optimized for each customer opportunity, which can include our direct sales force, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners.

Our Growth Strategy
We focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth:
•Keep our existing customers happy. We provide happiness to our customers by giving them an experience that delights them. We respond to customer needs with action to drive positive user experiences. We believe these practices result in our high scores across customer review sites and will continue to generate referrals from our existing customers, providing meaningful viral adoption for the foreseeable future.
•Drive new customer acquisition. Our platform is designed to make it easy to host meetings. By attracting free hosts to use our platform, we promote usage that allows hosts and their meeting attendees to experience the Zoom difference. We complement this lead-generation model with our multipronged go-to-market strategy that integrates the viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal routes-to-market, including direct sales representatives, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners. This approach allows us to cost-effectively drive upgrades to our paid offering and expansion within organizations of all sizes and verticals.
•Expand within existing customers. As organizations experience our platform and become familiar with its benefits, more teams and departments within these organizations adopt Zoom. Our platform may begin in a line of business and then organically expand across departments. This “land and expand” model has led to some of our largest deployments. Customers are also purchasing services for webinars, room solutions, phone, and contact center for a complete and integrated set of communications services.
•Innovate our platform continuously. Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of communication and collaboration technologies. We strive to deliver the best experience to our users by dedicating a portion of engineering capacity to developing on-demand, customer-requested features that would be valuable across our customer base.
•Drive international expansion. With users, offices, and data centers strategically located around the world, we are poised to reach new customers globally. Our platform is intuitively designed such that localization requirements are minimal. For example, our platform works without intensive translation requirements with only a few language adjustments to our user interface and support systems.
•Grow our developer ecosystem and continue to expand our platform. Through the Zoom Developer Platform, we enable customers and their developers to build their own solutions with our underlying platform technology, seamlessly embed our UC platform into their own offerings, and integrate their applications across Zoom products using our extensive library of application program interfaces (“APIs”) and selection of software development kits (“SDKs”). Our app marketplace further extends the value and adoption of Zoom with our customers through the development and distribution of apps and integrations. We continue to partner with video conferencing hardware and peripheral providers, and with software providers, including Palo Alto Networks, Zendesk, and Box.
Our Platform
We provide a unified communications and collaboration platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people interact, connecting them through frictionless and secure meetings, phone, chat, content sharing and more. Our core products are grouped under the following categories: Zoom One, Zoom Spaces, Zoom Events, Zoom Contact Center, Zoom AI, and Zoom Developers.
Zoom One
Zoom Meetings
Zoom Meetings provides HD video, voice, chat, and content sharing across mobile devices, desktops, laptops, telephones, and conference room systems. Our architecture can support up to 1,000 video participants in a single meeting. Conversations can be one to one, one to many, or many to many. Zoom Meetings feature 49-person video gallery view, virtual backgrounds, MP4/M4A cloud/local recording with transcripts, video breakout rooms, screen sharing with annotation, and integrations with other powerful business applications to help teams get more done together. Zoom Meetings integrate with tools created by companies such as Atlassian, Box, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Slack. Our meetings are a flexible tool for on-the-go employees who rely on their mobile device or tablet throughout their business day.
An end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings with up to 200 participants. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same 256-bit AES GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings by default,

but with Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to distribute these keys to the other meeting participants. Additionally, a customer managed key (“CMK”) service allows organizations to provide and manage their own encryption keys for certain customer content stored at rest in the Zoom Cloud. The organization needs to manage the keys in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service. This allows for encryption of applicable content stored in the Zoom Cloud using the keys that the organization controls.
Translated captions help to remove language barriers, connect people, and promote inclusivity in meetings and webinars. Captions are currently available between English and the following eleven languages: Chinese Mandarin – Simplified (beta), Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese (beta), Korean (beta), Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Ukrainian.
Zoom Phone
Zoom Phone is a cloud phone system for businesses that provides powerful private branch exchange (“PBX”) features, such as secure call routing, call queuing, call detail reports, call recording, call quality monitoring, voicemail, switch to video, and much more. Zoom Phone provides inbound and outbound calling via its support for native connectivity to the public switched telephone network (“PSTN”). Available stand-alone, or as an optional add-on to Zoom Meetings, Zoom Phone is a core component of our modern UCaaS strategy that enables customers to replace their existing PBX solution and consolidate all of their business communications and collaboration requirements onto Zoom. As of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, Zoom Phone provided native PSTN connectivity in more than 45 countries and territories.
Zoom Phone also supports Premises Peering and Cloud Peering, which provide customers with the flexibility to keep their current PSTN service providers by redirecting existing third-party voice circuits to the Zoom Phone cloud. Hybrid connectivity is also supported, allowing customers to mix native Zoom Phone calling plans and third-party voice circuits. This unique capability allows customers to enjoy all of the benefits and features of Zoom Phone while keeping their existing service provider contracts, phone numbers, and calling rates with their preferred carrier of record.
Zoom Phone Provider Exchange makes it easier for customers to choose their preferred PSTN provider partners, providing an improved way to connect with cloud peering partners, promote the discovery of new providers, and enable self-service of phone numbers from your selected partner. As of January 31, 2023, there are more than 90 countries and territories included in the Provider Exchange program.
Zoom Team Chat
Zoom Team Chat, which is included in Zoom One and Zoom Phone plans, enables organizations and teams to communicate and collaborate in groups, channels, or 1-1s and to stay connected by instantly sharing messages, images, files, and other content across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile devices. With Zoom Team Chat, users can easily invite people outside their organization to a chat conversation, and  quickly switch from a chat to a phone call or video meeting during a conversation. Zoom Team Chat also features content storage for users who want discoverability and the ability to review their conversations or shared files. There are dozens of Zoom Team Chat compatible applications available in the Zoom App Marketplace that provide notifications and improved workflow for other enterprise systems.
Zoom Mail and Calendar
Zoom Mail and Calendar includes both client experiences (Zoom Mail Client, Zoom Calendar Client) and service components (Zoom Mail Service, Zoom Calendar Service). Zoom Mail Client and Zoom Calendar Client can be used with third-party email and calendaring services from Microsoft or Google, or with Zoom Mail Service and Calendar Service. Zoom Mail Service and Zoom Calendar Service are Zoom-hosted offerings targeted at customers with up to 50 employees. Both the Client and Service offerings are generally available as of February 2023.

Zoom Essential Apps, launched January 2023, provides access to a curated list of apps at no cost for 1 year after app activation for Zoom One Pro, Business and Business Plus users to enhance their Zoom experience such as through visual agendas, automated tools to keep meetings on track and interactive activities to add energy and fun to meetings .
Our Technology and Infrastructure
Our unique technology and infrastructure enable best-in-class reliability, scalability, and performance. We designed our communications and collaboration platform to address the most difficult component of communications: video. Video requires intense computing resources for encoding, decoding, multiplexing, and synchronization, as well as higher bandwidth and network performance, to a much higher degree than other forms of communication like voice, chat, and content sharing. Our architecture separates video content processing from the transporting and mixing of streams. We allocate video content processing to intelligent agents that reside on client devices and dynamically encode and decode based upon the performance of client technology, network performance, and bandwidth. We leverage a next-generation multimedia router that operates on commodity hardware and a globally distributed cloud infrastructure to determine the optimal data centers to host a meeting and an optimal set of paths to connect the participants.
Our Customers
We have customers of all sizes, from individuals to global Fortune 50 organizations. Our current customer base spans numerous industry categories, including education, entertainment/media, enterprise infrastructure, finance, government, health care, manufacturing, nonprofit/not for profit and social impact, retail/consumer products, and software/internet. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. 
Sales
Our sales model combines our viral demand generation and our free Zoom Meetings plan with a sales approach optimized for the size of each customer opportunity. Our direct sales force includes our field sales representatives as well as our inside sales team, and it is organized by customer subscription size, region, and vertical. Our channel team coordinates the activities of resellers and strategic partners to build a strong ecosystem that broadens our reach. Our online channel supports high-volume, high-velocity, self-service sales.

Marketing
Our marketing team’s primary objective is to create preference for our brand by leveraging our viral growth, enhancing brand perception, and engaging our users with virtual events, content, social media, and customer advisory councils. We complement our viral growth with targeted online and out-of-home advertising. We shifted our events strategy from in-person to online and then to hybrid as the world came out the pandemic, including hosting Zoomtopia, our annual user conference, as hybrid experience featuring both in person and virtual events to tens of thousands of attendees.
Research and Development
We drive our business with constant innovation. We have research and development presence in China, India, Singapore and the United States, which we believe is a strategic advantage for us, allowing us to invest more in increasing our product capabilities in an efficient manner with a “follow the sun” strategy.
Our Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We face competition from legacy web-based meeting services providers, including Cisco Webex and GoTo, bundled productivity solution providers with video functionality, including Google Workspace and Microsoft Teams, and UCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including 8x8, Avaya, and RingCentral, as well as consumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including Amazon, Apple, and Facebook. Additionally, as we build out Zoom Contact Center, we may face additional competition, including from Five9, Inc., Genesys and NICE inContact.
We believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors:
•video-first platform;
•cloud-native architecture;
•functionality and scalability;
•ease of use and reliability;
•brand awareness and preference;
•ability to utilize existing infrastructure, such as legacy conference room hardware; and
•low total cost of ownership.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We actively seek patent protection covering inventions originating from our company. We also pursue the registration and enforcement of trademarks and domain names in the United States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. Our software is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. Our policy requires employees and independent contractors to sign agreements (1) assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, and other intellectual property generated by them in the course of their employment, and (2) agreeing to protect our confidential information.
In certain circumstances, we license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products. This may include open source software. We take steps to ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses governing such licensed technology. We believe our business is not materially dependent on any individual patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, license, or other intellectual property right. For information on the risks associated with our intellectual property, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”
Government Regulation
Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”

Human Capital
As of January 31, 2023, we had 8,484 full-time employees. Of these employees, 4,588 are in the United States and 3,896 are in our international locations. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. Employees in one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have the benefit of a collective bargaining agreement and are represented by a workers’ council. We have not experienced interruptions of operations or any work stoppages due to labor disagreements. 
Our Culture of Happiness
We are focused on delivering happiness to our employees and customers. We strive to change the way business is done through our communications technology and our company culture. We take happiness so seriously that we have an employee-led happiness committee and crew to facilitate and amplify our efforts to deliver happiness to our employees and customers.
Our culture of delivering happiness drives our mission, vision, and values and is fundamental to everything we do at Zoom:
•Mission. Our mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.
•Vision. Our vision is to empower people to accomplish more through video communications.
•Values. We care for our community, our customers, our company, our teammates, and ourselves.
This culture supports our hiring and serves as a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining top talent. Zoom was prominently featured in the computer software category on Fortune’s ‘Most Admired Companies’ list. Additionally, it was named to the Variety500, an award that recognizes the most influential business leaders shaping the industry. Zoom was also named to Newsweek’s “America's Greatest Workplaces 2023 for Diversity” list.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) at Zoom is an embodiment of our core value of Care. DEI also represents our intentional effort to create an inclusive environment of the brightest minds from a broad set of backgrounds in order to create the most innovative solutions for our customers. Our approach to DEI is driven across four strategic focus areas: workforce (who and how we hire), workplace (how it feels to work at Zoom), marketplace (how we include our customers) and community (how we help to make the world more equitable).
We have taken steps to diversify our candidate outreach through engagements with AfroTech, Merritt College, AnitaB.org, and a five-year strategic partnership with Claflin University. In our workplace, our Zoom Talks initiative creates ongoing spaces for our employees to learn more about one another’s unique backgrounds. We have a number of Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) with a focus on Black, Latinx, Women, Asian and Pacific Islander, Veteran, and LGBTQ+ communities. Our ERGs offer our employees support and community building opportunities, and help to foster an inclusive environment and diverse workplace. Our DEI Team continues to partner with teams leading our product design and marketing to invest in making our products even more inclusive and accessible to the diverse set of communities we serve. 
Compensation and Benefits
We offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being. Our employees’ total compensation packages include base pay, bonuses or sales commissions, and equity. We offer a wide array of benefits including comprehensive healthcare benefits, including mental health and fertility benefits, wellness benefits, a book reimbursement plan to support continuous learning, and charitable gift matching through our Zoom Cares program.
Over the past several years, we conducted a comprehensive employee survey with regular follow-ups and engaged in peer research to make thoughtful decisions on how to move forward in an evolving world of work. Two priorities were immediately clear: keeping our employees safe and supporting them through a meaningful employee experience. We believe maintaining a flexible working environment for our employees is a key priority. We offer three “workstyles” for our employees (in-person, remote and hybrid) and will be allow most employees to choose their own workstyle.
