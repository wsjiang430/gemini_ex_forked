ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

Overview
Kontoor Brands, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, "Kontoor," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") is a global lifestyle apparel company, with a portfolio led by two of the world’s most iconic consumer brands: Wrangler® and Lee®. The Company designs, produces, procures, markets, distributes and licenses apparel, footwear and accessories, primarily under the brand names Wrangler® and Lee®. The Company’s products are sold in the United States (“U.S.”) through mass merchants, specialty stores, mid-tier and traditional department stores, company-operated stores and online. The Company’s products are also sold internationally, primarily in the Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions, through department, specialty, company-operated, concession retail and independently-operated partnership stores and online.
Kontoor is headquartered in the U.S. with a presence in over 70 countries. Our primary brands, Wrangler® and Lee®, benefit from heritages spanning over 200 combined years. During 2022, we sold approximately 157 million units of apparel across all brands. We sell our products primarily through our established wholesale and expanding digital ecosystems, supplemented through our branded brick & mortar locations. We benefit from strong relationships with many of our customers who we believe depend on our ability to reliably and timely replenish our high-volume products.
We focus on continuously improving the most important elements of our products, which include fit, fabric, finish and overall construction, while continuing to provide our products to consumers at attractive price points. We leverage innovation and design advancements as well as our unique brand heritages to create products that meet our consumers' needs.
The Company operates and reports using a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. For presentation purposes herein, all references to periods ended December 2022, December 2021 and December 2020 correspond to the 52-week fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 and the 53-week fiscal year ended January 2, 2021, respectively. 
Macroeconomic Environment and Other Recent Developments
Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary concerns, distress in global credit markets and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as ongoing supply chain disruptions, labor challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to adversely impact global economic conditions, as well as the Company's operations. We do not have significant operations in Russia or Ukraine, and exited our distribution arrangement in Russia in 2022. However, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues to cause disruption in the surrounding areas and greater uncertainty in the global economy.
Inflationary pressures increased key input costs and softened consumer demand beginning late in the second quarter of 2022 and continued through the second half of 2022. The rise in interest rates during the second half of 2022 also contributed to reduced consumer discretionary spending, resulting in retailer actions to reduce their inventory levels which negatively impacted our sales, primarily during the third quarter of 2022.
We continued to experience delays in product and raw material availability into the first half of 2022 due largely to global supply chain disruptions, driven in part by port congestion and transportation delays, and incurred transitory costs, including air freight to expedite shipments to meet customer demand. Many global supply chain disruptions became less prevalent during the second half compared to the first half of 2022. Accordingly, we were able to reduce our use of air freight, but experienced increases in other input costs, including ocean freight. 
We experienced store closures, disruptions in distribution and restrictions on consumer mobility in certain regions of China during 2022 due to COVID-19 and related restrictions, which had a significant impact on sales and operations in APAC. We took actions to manage these impacts including the expansion of our credit lines in the region during the second quarter of 2022 to ensure sufficient liquidity.
All of the above factors contributed to increased inventory levels, primarily in core product. This increase was most significant in the third quarter of 2022. To manage inventory, we adjusted receipts on sourced goods and took downtime in our internal manufacturing facilities in the fourth quarter of 2022. These conditions drove higher provisions for inventory losses in 2022 compared to the prior year. We continue to work with our customers and vendors to meet ongoing demand and minimize supply chain impacts.
While we anticipate continued macroeconomic uncertainty during 2023, we believe that we are appropriately positioned to successfully manage through known operational challenges. We continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including consumer behavior and the impact of these factors on consumer demand and our business.

Our Competitive Strengths
•Iconic Brands With Significant Global Scale
The Wrangler® and Lee® brands are steeped in rich heritage and authenticity, with 76 years and 134 years of history, respectively, and have an established global presence in the apparel market. Products bearing our brands are sold in more than 70 countries, and we believe they have strong consumer connectivity worldwide. We market our brands and products to highlight their differentiated position and product attributes. We sit at the center of cultural moments and cater broadly to customers through our global and regional licensed collaborations, such as Yellowstone, The Brooklyn Circus, The Hundreds, Pendleton, Leon Bridges, Fender, Billabong, among others, as well as participation in festivals such as Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo and Austin City Limits. We strive to maximize our consumer reach by leveraging each brand’s best practices to drive growth across product categories and expand our overall net revenues and earnings profile.
•Deep Relationships With Leading Global Brick & Mortar and E-Commerce Retailers
We have developed long-term relationships with many leading global brick & mortar and e-commerce retailers, including Amazon, Kohl’s, Target and Walmart, whom we believe rely on our iconic brands, leading product quality and value, and innovation to address evolving consumer needs in our product categories. We foster close and long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers, having partnered with each of our top three brick & mortar wholesale customers for over 30 years and with Amazon for over 15 years. Our rich global heritage across both the Wrangler® and Lee® brands also supports strong positions in growing markets, such as in the U.S. Western specialty channel and with leading retailers in China. By fostering these relationships, we have become an important vendor for many of our customers and have built leading category positions, which in turn supports the availability of our brands to consumers and our ability to introduce new products and categories. We also endeavor to provide sophisticated logistics, planning, and merchandising expertise to support our customers, which we believe enables a level of insight that builds more integrated customer relationships. 
•Integrated Supply Chain Built to Support Volume and Replenishment
We are continually refining our supply chain to maximize efficiency and reinforce our reputation of reliability with our customers. Through our vertically integrated supply chain, we manufacture, source and distribute a significant quantity of high-volume apparel products that are frequently replenished by our retail partners. Our product procurement and distribution strategies, combined with our internal manufacturing facilities and retail floor space management programs, create increased operating flexibility. Our supply chain is built to support large volumes and to meet customer needs while balancing cost and operational requirements. Our internal manufacturing facilities are all located in the Western Hemisphere where their proximity to our primary markets enables us to deliver inventory in a consistent and timely manner. We also have established global third-party sourcing and distribution networks that we leverage across product categories and various regions. We currently have three technical service centers located in North Carolina, South China and Bangladesh. We believe our flexible and balanced approach to manufacturing and distribution allows us to better manage our production needs and to support expanded digital distribution. Additionally, we expect to further leverage our new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system to deliver global cost savings, reduce complexity in our supply chain, create better inventory management and improve our speed in the market.
•Highly Experienced Management Team and Board of Directors
We have a highly experienced senior management team that continuously demonstrates an unwavering commitment to our employees, our shareholders and our business. Drawing on the management team’s deep industry knowledge and diverse perspectives, they have helped navigate our business through unprecedented challenges spurred by a global pandemic, while simultaneously evolving our purpose-led strategies with agility and flexibility. As we continue our transformational period focused on catalyzing growth for our global brands, we believe our management team and Board of Directors will continue to drive the success of our company.
•Resilient Business Model That Delivers Consistent Results
Our business has historically generated consistent margins and strong cash flows due to our global reach, leading market positions, deep customer relationships, and the vertical integration of our supply chain. We believe we offer high product value and quality to our consumers, who respond to our value proposition by consistently purchasing our products over time. Our strong margin profile combined with our diligent approach to operational excellence and capital management have produced meaningful cash flows. We believe our consistent financial results will provide us with the opportunity to consistently invest in our business and deploy a multi-faceted capital allocation strategy. Despite the macroeconomic pressures faced by the Company in recent years, we have been resilient. We responded with agility to shifting market conditions, continued to produce forward momentum and transitioned to our Horizon 2 strategy discussed below, focusing on cash flow, optionality and revenue and margin growth to drive long-term acceleration.

Our Strategies
Our management team continues to focus on the long-term strategic initiatives we introduced in 2019, when we became a standalone public company. 
During Horizon 1, or the first 18-24 months as a standalone public company, we established a healthier foundation for profitable growth. This was supported by streamlining our global operations, migrating to a new technology platform, enhancing gross margin through improving quality of sales and de-levering our balance sheet.
We are now in Horizon 2, which is focused on driving brand growth and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders including our consumers, customers, shareholders, suppliers and the communities where we do business around the world. We are focused on the following four areas that we believe will catalyze profitable revenue growth in the future:
•Enhance and Accelerate Our Core U.S. Wholesale Business
We are focused on continuing to enhance the global strength of our brands, improve operating efficiency and increase the overall demand for our products. Within our largest market and channel, we are pursuing strategies to support and grow market share in existing distribution with leading retailers, drive business opportunities in new channels, such as premium, specialty and sporting goods, as well as accelerate complementary categories.
•Diversify Our Product Mix Through Category Extensions, Including Outdoor, Workwear and T-shirts
We continue to enhance our existing product assortment, broaden our product offering and expand into adjacent product categories, with a focus on outdoor, workwear and t-shirts. Within outdoor, we are bringing to market new product innovation platforms such as collections from All Terrain Gear by WranglerTM and Wrangler AnglerTM. Within workwear, we are leveraging our strong brand equity and innovation platforms to enter new markets and categories. And in t‑shirts, we are focusing our efforts across logo, lifestyle and licensed/collaboration content. Successful execution of our product expansion strategies should broaden the appeal of our brands and products to new consumers and ultimately drive the overall net revenues of the business.
•Expand Our Reach Around the Globe, Prioritizing Opportunities Within the China and Europe Regions
We continue to pursue opportunities to expand the distribution of our products with new and existing customers internationally. In Asia, we launched a retail excellence initiative with reformatted stores, improved point of sale technologies and enhanced assortments. In Europe, we are refining our strategy to become more consumer-centric in addressing how and where our customers want to purchase our products, such as the introduction of a dual-branded Lee® and Wrangler® premium retail concept in Berlin in 2022 with plans to extend to additional stores in select European markets. To support our growth initiatives, we approved plans during the third quarter of 2022 to globalize our operating model and relocate our European headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland. Wrangler®, which is currently approximately 90% U.S. domestic, has many international growth opportunities, particularly in China and Europe.
•Elevate Our Direct Connection With Consumers Through Channel Expansion, Focused on Evolving the Company’s Direct-to-consumer and Digital Ecosystem
We are leveraging our leading brand positions to increase our digital penetration with our own e‑commerce websites as well as major global retail partners, as we continue to evolve our digital ecosystem. We are making progress towards these objectives through amplified investments in advanced data analytics capabilities and unlocking new value through our global ERP infrastructure. In addition, we are stepping up our investment in accretive enablers, such as product and design, innovation, supply chain, talent and culture and demand creation.
Our Business Segment Information 
Our two reportable segments are Wrangler® and Lee®, which primarily include sales of branded products, along with various sub-brands and collections as discussed under each brand below. In addition, we present an Other category for purposes of reconciliation of reportable segment net revenues and profits to the Company's consolidated operating results, but the Other category is not considered a reportable segment. See below for additional information on the brands, channels of distribution and geographies included in each segment.

•Other
Other primarily includes other revenue sources, including sales and licensing of Rock & Republic® apparel. Rock & Republic® is a premium apparel brand and is marketed to consumers as a modern and active lifestyle brand. We distribute the brand in the U.S. and Canada by leveraging our retail and e-commerce relationships. Other also included sales of third-party branded merchandise at company-owned outlet stores through the first quarter of 2021. 
Distribution Channels and Customers
Our distribution channels include U.S. Wholesale, Non-U.S. Wholesale, Direct-to-Consumer and Other.
•U.S. Wholesale
The U.S. Wholesale channel is our largest distribution channel and accounted for approximately 72% of our net revenues in 2022. Within this channel, our Wrangler® and Lee® branded products are marketed and sold by mass and mid-tier retailers, specialty stores including western specialty retail, department stores and retailer-owned and third-party e-commerce sites. This channel also includes revenues related to Rock & Republic® products sold in the U.S. A portion of our U.S. Wholesale net revenue is attributable to digital sales from our wholesale partners’ websites, third-party e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, and other pure-play digital retailers. Third-party e-commerce platforms and pure-play digital retailers are a growing and important portion of this channel.
Our mass merchant customers include national retailers such as Target and Walmart, as well as various regional retail partners. Our mid-tier and traditional department store customers include national retailers such as Kohl’s and Nordstrom as well as other retail partners. The specialty store channel, which includes revenue from Wrangler® Riggs Workwear® and Wrangler® Western branded products, consists primarily of national accounts such as Boot Barn, Cavender's and Tractor Supply Company as well as upscale modern specialty stores.
We foster close and longstanding relationships with our wholesale customers, having partnered with each of our top three brick & mortar wholesale customers for over 30 years. In addition, we engage in an active dialogue with many of our key wholesale customers and receive proprietary insights about how our products are performing on a timely basis. Our brands’ top U.S. Wholesale customers include Amazon, Kohl’s, Target and Walmart.
In addition, a small portion of sales in our U.S. Wholesale channel are from domestic licensing arrangements where we receive royalties based on a percentage of the licensed products’ net revenues. Most of the agreements provide for a minimum royalty requirement. See “Licensing Arrangements” herein for more information.
•Non-U.S. Wholesale
The Non-U.S. Wholesale channel represents the majority of our international business and accounted for approximately 17% of our net revenues in 2022. The majority of the Wrangler® and Lee® international product business is located in EMEA and APAC, where we sell our products directly to our department store and specialty store wholesale customers, and indirectly through our distribution and license relationships. This channel also includes revenues related to Rock & Republic® products sold in Canada. In Canada and Mexico, our products are marketed through mass merchants, department stores and specialty stores. Additionally, our Non-U.S. Wholesale channel includes non-U.S. sales on digital platforms operated by our wholesale customers, as well as sales in partnership stores located across EMEA, APAC and South America. Partnership stores are owned and operated by our licensees, distributors and other independent parties. They are retail locations selling our Wrangler® and Lee® branded products that have the appearance of Kontoor-operated stores, and as such represent an important vehicle for presenting our brands to international consumers. Similar to the U.S. Wholesale channel, we use proprietary insights from our wholesale customers to strategically refine our products and adjust our go-to-market approach.
Geographically, our net revenue in EMEA is concentrated in developed markets such as France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Scandinavia, Spain and the United Kingdom. We access the APAC market primarily through our business in China. Canada is the largest international market for Wrangler® branded products, while China is the largest international market for Lee® branded products.

In addition, a small portion of sales in our Non-U.S. Wholesale channel are from international licensing arrangements where we receive royalties based on a percentage of the licensed products’ net revenues. Most of the agreements provide for a minimum royalty requirement. See “Licensing Arrangements” herein for more information.
•Direct-to-Consumer
Our Direct-to-Consumer channel accounted for approximately 11% of our net revenues in 2022 and represents the distribution of our products via our Wrangler® and Lee® branded full-price stores and Company-operated outlet stores globally, as well as digital sales generated globally from our own websites, including www.wrangler.com and www.lee.com, and concession retail locations internationally. 
The Direct-to-Consumer channel allows us to achieve the fullest expression of our brands by displaying our product lines in a manner that supports the brands’ positioning, providing an in-store and online user experience that enables us to address the needs and preferences of our consumers. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 26 Company-operated full-price Wrangler® and Lee® branded retail stores, which are located in Asia, Europe and the U.S. They include both mono-brand stores, which exclusively carry either Wrangler® or Lee® branded products, and dual-brand stores, which carry both Wrangler® and Lee® branded products. We also had 51 Company-operated outlet and clearance centers as of December 31, 2022, primarily our Lee Wrangler OutletTM and Lee Wrangler Clearance CenterTM retail stores located in the U.S., as well as locations in Europe and Mexico. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 176 concession retail and outlet stores in Europe and Asia. Under a typical concession arrangement, we have a dedicated sales area, pay a concession fee for use of the space based on a percentage of retail sales and, in many cases, manage staffing for operation of the sales area. The concession model provides dedicated sales areas for our brands and helps differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products, generally without incurring the full overhead of opening a separate store.
We continue to prioritize serving our customers through digital platforms that enhance the user experience and drive customer interaction in digital and physical environments. Digitally-enabled transactions generated from our own websites represent a growing portion of our net revenues, and help elevate the connection consumers have with our brands. Wrangler® and Lee® branded products are currently available through our own websites in 15 countries.
•Other
Other included sales of third-party branded merchandise at company-owned outlet stores through the first quarter of 2021.
Licensing Arrangements
We seek to maximize our brands’ market penetration and consumer reach by entering into licensing agreements with independent parties. Pursuant to these licensing agreements, we typically grant our licensing partner an exclusive or non-exclusive license to use one or more of our brands in connection with specific licensed categories of products in specific geographic regions. Our licensing partners leverage the strength of our brands and our customer relationships to sell products in their licensed categories and geographic regions. We currently have licensing agreements in categories including jeanswear, casual apparel, workwear, belts, footwear, small leather goods, headwear, socks, home décor, luggage, bags, watches, eyewear and cold weather accessories.
We retain oversight and approvals of the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products to help maintain our brand and product quality standards. License agreements are for fixed terms of typically two to five years. Each licensee pays royalties based on its sales of licensed products, with the majority of agreements requiring a minimum royalty payment. Licensing net revenue was $32.5 million in 2022.
Design, Product Development and Innovation 
The design, product development and innovation teams work together to deliver our brands' product strategy, combining extensive experience and know-how to create a unique product combination of world-class value, quality and styling for our customers and consumers. We design and develop products globally, with key functions in the U.S. and Hong Kong. These creative teams collaborate with the merchandising, marketing, planning, consumer insights and executive teams to ensure the product delivers against brand positioning, value, customer and consumer needs and sustainability requirements. We have two primary selling seasons, Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter, although some product lines are offered more frequently.
In addition to our global design and product development functions, we operate an innovation center in Greensboro, North Carolina. Research for advanced product technology takes place in our material science lab. The research focus includes raw materials, garment construction, laser processing and wash-finishing advancements. This location is staffed with dedicated scientists and engineers who leverage consumer insights to create new products and material technologies, enhance attributes of existing products and improve manufacturing techniques. Our innovation network is integral to our design approach and long-term growth, allowing us to evolve and deliver product experiences that meet our consumer needs.

Manufacturing, Sourcing and Distribution
Our global supply chain organization is responsible for the operational planning, manufacturing, sourcing and distribution of products to our customers. We believe we have developed a high degree of expertise in managing the complexities associated with a global supply chain. During 2022, we produced or sourced approximately 175 million units of apparel. Our supply chain employs a centralized leadership model with localized regional expertise. Within our internal manufacturing facilities, we innovate and design proprietary equipment to drive our production output and capabilities. We focus on engineering and efficiency, which we believe provides an ongoing competitive advantage in our internal manufacturing facilities. We leverage our manufacturing expertise in our sourcing operations, where we have developed longstanding relationships with third-party contract manufacturers and distributors. We believe this manufacturing and sourcing approach, coupled with strategic inventory and retail floor space management programs with many of our major retail customers, gives us operational flexibility as we continue to expand our distribution.
We continued to experience delays in product and raw material availability into the first half of 2022 due largely to global supply chain disruptions, driven in part by port congestion and transportation delays, and incurred transitory costs, including air freight to expedite shipments to meet customer demand. Many global supply chain disruptions became less prevalent during the second half compared to the first half of 2022, but certain macroeconomic conditions contributed to higher inventory levels. Accordingly, we adjusted receipts on sourced goods and took downtime in our internal manufacturing facilities in the fourth quarter of 2022 to manage inventory. We continue to work with our customers and vendors to meet ongoing demand and minimize supply chain impacts.
•Sourcing and Manufacturing
We believe the combination of our internal manufacturing and contract manufacturing across different geographic regions provides a well-balanced, flexible approach to product procurement. Within our own manufacturing facilities, we purchase raw materials from numerous U.S. and international suppliers to meet our production needs. Raw materials include products made from cotton, polyester, spandex and lycra blends, as well as thread and trim (such as product identification, buttons, zippers and snaps). Fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are typically set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases. No single supplier represents more than 10% of our total cost of goods sold. We operate global sourcing hubs, which are responsible for managing contract manufacturing and procurement of product, including supplier oversight, product quality assurance, sustainability within the supply chain, responsible sourcing, and transportation and shipping functions.
We operate ten manufacturing facilities, comprised of seven owned facilities in Mexico and three leased facilities in Nicaragua. We also source products from approximately 225 contract manufacturing facilities in 19 countries. During 2022, approximately 31% of our units were manufactured in our internal manufacturing facilities, and approximately 69% were sourced from contract manufacturers. Products obtained from contractors in the Western Hemisphere frequently have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in Asia. However, internal manufacturing combined with contracting in the Western Hemisphere gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and allows for enhanced inventory management in the U.S. market. In making decisions about the location of manufacturing operations and suppliers, we consider several factors including the raw material source, the market the product will be sold in, production lead times, duties and tariffs, product cost, product complexity and the ability to pursue upside demand. Additionally, we continually monitor risks and developments related to duties, tariffs, quotas and other factors and we often manufacture and source products from countries with tariff preferences and free trade agreements.
•Distribution
Products are shipped from our contract manufacturers and internal manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the world. We directly operate our domestic distribution centers and we carefully select third-party logistic providers to partner with as needed in certain regions, primarily in EMEA and APAC. All of our distribution centers are strategically located to provide speed and service to our consumers at the most efficient cost possible. Additionally, our established long-term third-party distribution relationships ensure maximum capacity, connectivity, responsiveness and overall service coverage around the globe. In international markets where we do not have brick & mortar or wholesale operations, our products are often marketed through our distributors, agents and licensees.
Inventory Management
Inventory management is key to the cash flows and operating results of our business. We manage our inventory levels based on existing orders, anticipated sales and the delivery requirements of our customers, which requires close coordination with our customers. For new product introductions, which often require large initial launch shipments, we may commence production before receiving orders for those products. Key areas of focus include added discipline around the purchasing of product, inventory optimization and channel placement, as well as better planning and execution in disposition of excess inventory through our various channels. Our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand, while improving our inventory efficiency over the long-term through the recent implementation of the Company's global ERP system and inventory optimization tools. Reduced consumer discretionary spending and the negative impact on our sales has resulted in increased inventory levels, primarily in core product. The Company is taking proactive measures to manage our inventory.

Advertising and Customer Support
Our advertising and marketing efforts focus on differentiating our brands’ positioning and highlighting our product qualities. We are focused on creating globally unified brand messages with appropriate regional nuances in order to maximize our brand recognition, and drive brand demand from initial end consumer awareness to long-term loyalty. By utilizing global heads of marketing, we continue to develop integrated, multi-channel marketing strategies designed to effectively reach the target consumers of each of our brands. We pursue this strategy through our use of a variety of media channels and other public endorsements, including traditional media such as television, print and radio, as well as digital media channels such as display, online video, social media, live streaming, paid search and influencers. We leverage marketing analytics to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending, and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments. Our strategy also includes collaborating with other influential brands and developing new advertising campaigns that drive consumer awareness and brand equity.
We also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media, radio and television. We generally provide advertising support to our wholesale customers in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products. Our websites, www.wrangler.com, www.lee.com and corresponding regional websites, enhance consumer understanding of our brands and help consumers find and buy our products. We employ a support team for each brand that is responsible for customer service at the consumer level as well as a sales force that manages our customer relationships.
Seasonality
Our operating results are generally subject to some variability due to seasonality, with net revenues typically being slightly higher during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. This limited variation results primarily from the differences in seasonal influences on revenues between our Wrangler® and Lee® segments. With changes in our mix of business and the growth of our direct-to-consumer operations, historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends. Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital typically increases early in the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Cash provided by operating activities is usually substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements. However, during the second half of 2022, reduced consumer discretionary spending and the negative impact on our sales drove higher inventory levels, resulting in increased working capital. The Company is taking proactive measures to manage working capital. 
Competition 
The apparel industry is highly competitive, highly fragmented and characterized by low barriers to entry with many local, regional and global competitors. We compete in the apparel and accessories sector by leveraging our brands, scale and ability to develop high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices that meet consumer needs.
Our primary branded competitors are large, globally focused apparel companies that also participate in a variety of categories, including, but not limited to, athletic wear, denim, exclusive or private labels, casual lifestyle apparel, outerwear and workwear. A select list of key competitors includes Calvin Klein, Carhartt, Columbia, Diesel, Guess, Levi’s and Tommy Hilfiger. Additionally, we see a large and growing offering from private label apparel created for retailers such as Amazon, Target, Walmart and Kohl's.
Intellectual Property
Trademarks, trade names, patents and domain names, as well as related logos, designs and graphics, provide substantial value in the development and marketing of our products, and are important to our continued success. We have registered our intellectual property in the U.S. and in other countries where our products are manufactured and/or sold. In particular, our trademark portfolio consists of over 8,100 trademark registrations and applications in the U.S. and other countries around the world, including U.S. and foreign trademark registrations for our two key brands, Wrangler® and Lee®. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, in general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable provided that the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. Typically, trademark registrations can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We also place high importance on product innovation and design, and a number of these innovations and designs are the subject of patents. However, we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.
Human Capital
We understand that our greatest asset is our global employee base. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 14,400 employees worldwide. Geographically, approximately 1,100 employees are located in APAC, approximately 600 are located in EMEA, approximately 9,800 are located in Latin America and Mexico, primarily supporting our manufacturing facilities, and approximately 2,900 are located in the U.S. In international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by trade sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be good.

Our Kontoor DEI commitments include creating a global workforce of high-performing teams that both unlocks our individual uniqueness and harnesses our collaborative talents, ensuring an equitable environment that attracts and promotes a diverse workforce, and fostering inclusivity, ensuring employees feel they can bring their whole selves to work.
We continue to provide employees with resources that integrate inclusion and diversity into our learning culture and philosophy. This year, we launched our Inclusion Tech Pack, a resource which provides a framework to discuss inclusion within teams and reinforce our inclusion principles of trust, belonging, empowerment and communication.
Our employee resource groups (ERGs) are voluntary, employee-led groups that foster diversity of thought, and have sponsored many events that have educated and connected us, such as Juneteenth and Pride month celebrations. We continue to expand the reach of our ERGs in other regions across the globe. 
•Workplace Health & Safety
We consider health and safety as core values in all our operations. We do not jeopardize the well-being of our employees, contractors or supply chain partners to complete any tasks, projects or other priorities. We believe that all the people involved in the development of our products are our most important assets; therefore, we have created and implemented strong health and safety policies and procedures that go beyond the governmental standards. Our operations have an Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable incident rate ("RIR") significantly below the average RIR of our industry; however, we strive to reach zero injuries. 
Social Responsibility, Community Outreach and Sustainability
We are a purpose-led organization and are committed to environmental sustainability, labor welfare and community development, not only because today’s consumers demand the highest standards from the brands they utilize, but because we believe these values are consistent with what our brands represent and are the right thing to do to enhance global welfare. Corporate sustainability and responsibility is an important priority for the Company and the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is responsible for promoting the exercise of responsible corporate citizenship and monitoring adherence to Kontoor’s standards. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews and evaluates our strategies, programs, policies and practices relating to environmental, social and governance issues and impacts to support the sustainable and responsible growth of our business. Kontoor believes that in order to grow as a Company, it has a responsibility to help improve the well-being of its communities. Kontoor articulates its commitments to corporate sustainability and responsibility in its Code of Conduct which can be found on our website at www.kontoorbrands.com.
Our sustainability strategy is built on innovation, design and sustainable performance, underscoring our commitment to inspire people to live with passion and confidence. We believe that sustainability translates to the dynamic process of continual improvement for people, for our product and for the planet. The Company issued its most recent sustainability report in December 2021, which was our first report prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards, and plans to issue our next sustainability report in 2023.
We have set sustainability goals focused on renewable energy and reducing emissions and water use, and are making progress toward those goals. In December 2022, the Company submitted science-based targets for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions to the Science Based Targets Initiative. Other highlights included the evaluation of fresh water use in the manufacturing process of our Torreon internal manufacturing complex, which helped us move closer to our goal of saving 10 billion liters of water by 2025, and the expansion of our flagship sustainability program Indigood® to supplier denim mills who are committed to achieving a significant reduction of fresh water in denim production. Our brands also launched collections of vintage and preloved apparel, entering a growing market that has the potential to cut greenhouse gas emissions, minimize waste, and reduce primary resource use.
