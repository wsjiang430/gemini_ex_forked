Item 1. BUSINESS
HISTORY OF OUR COMPANY
 
The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed in March 2014 as a limited liability company under the name, The Greater Cannabis Company, LLC. The Company remained a wholly owned subsidiary of Sylios Corp until March 2017. The Company’s initial business plan was to concentrate on cannabis related investment and development opportunities through its online retail store, direct equity investments, joint ventures, licensing agreements or acquisitions. Our current operations are focused on our online store, GCC Superstore.
 
On July 31, 2018, the Company entered into and consummated a voluntary share exchange transaction with Green C Corporation, a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario (“Green C”) and the shareholders of Green C (the “Selling Shareholders”) pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement by and among the Company, Green C and the Selling Shareholders (the “Exchange Agreement”).
 
Green C is the owner of an exclusive, worldwide license for an eluting transmucosal patch platform (“ETP”) for non-invasive drug delivery in the cannabis field for medical treatment as further described in the exclusive license agreement dated June 21, 2018 with Pharmedica. A copy of the License Agreement is incorporated by reference to this report as Exhibit 10.1 of the Company’s current report on Form 8-K dated August 3, 2018 (the “License Agreement”).
 
In accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company issued 9,411,998 shares of its preferred stock, par value $0.001 (the “Shares”) to the Selling Shareholders and certain individuals named below (collectively, the “Shareholder Group”) in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Green C (the “Exchange Transaction”). As a result of the Exchange Transaction, the Selling Shareholders acquired 29.67% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock, Green C became the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary and the Company acquired 100% of the business and operations of Green C.

After the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, we switched our business model in fiscal 2018 and no longer intend to pursue E-commerce, advertising, licensing (except as specified below) or direct investment operations. We are now engaged in the commercialization of our exclusively licensed technology for medical medicinal or recreational cannabis (where permitted) for the transmucosal delivery of medicinal or recreational cannabis (where permitted) (other than in the field of oral care) or any other product exploiting such technology for the transmucosal delivery of medicinal or recreational cannabis (where permitted) (collectively, the “Technology”).
 
The commercialization of the Technology is expected to require an investment of up to $1,500,000 and up to one year to finalize.
 
The Company’s business plan is to (i) commercialize its ETP technology and (ii) concentrate on cannabis related investment and development opportunities through direct equity investments, joint ventures, licensing agreements or acquisitions.
 
The Company is actively seeking licensing opportunities in the cannabis sector for intellectual property and products. At present, the Company’s sole active, exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement is with Pharmedica for its ETP technology.
 
Our principal executive office is located at The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc., 15 Walker Avenue, Suite 101, Baltimore, MD 21208, and our telephone number is (443) 738-4051.
 
Strategy
 
The Company owns the worldwide license for a novel drug delivery technology from Pharmedica, a biopharmaceutical research and development company. The technology is centered around the eluting patch platform, which is a bioadhesive, transmucosal orally dissolving thin film system. The platform allows for actives loaded onto the eluting patch to be absorbed by the buccal mucosa into the body.
 
The Company has an exclusive license for the technology in cannabinoid use. The Company intends to commercialize the technology by sublicensing or partnering with companies in the cannabis industry to bring the product to market. Potential partners include licensed producers, distributors, processors, consumer product and pharmaceutical companies. The Company intends to focus on the North American market both in medical and recreational cannabis segments.
 
Competition
 
There are a number of other companies operating in the cannabis space. Such companies range from producers of cannabis plants to makers of cannabis-based edible products to developers of different methods of cannabis delivery. Known competitors in our space include IntelGenix Technologies (IGXT), CTT Pharmaceuticals (CTTH) and Cure Pharmaceuticals (CURR). These are all biopharmaceutical companies focused on developing orally dissolving thin film technologies with cannabinoid applications.
Raw Materials
 
We require water soluble polymers including hydroxylpropyl, methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, polyinyl alcohol, polyethyle oxide, polyvinyl pyrollidones, starch based polymers and crosslinkable polymers such as polyacrylic acid, sodium alginate and polyethyline oxide, cannabinoid actives such as cannabidiol, tetrahydrocannabinol or other derivatives of cannabis. Most of these are easily attainable pharmaceutical grade cannabinoids.

Intellectual Property
 
As at the date hereof, the Company’s intellectual property consists of a Pharmedica patent providing broad coverage for the Company’s licensed technology.
 
The Issued patent is: WO 2010/135053 A2 Dual and single layer dosage forms.
 
The Issued USA patent was filed on April 28, 2015.
 
The Company filed an additional provisional patent: US 62/737,153 Oral dissolving film for rapid and sustained release and delivery of Cannabinoids on September 27, 2018. The provisional application was accepted.
Costs and Effects of Complying with Environmental Regulations
 
Not applicable.
 
Research and Development
 
The Company is involved in additional research and development of innovative delivery systems. The Company expects to develop new formulations around cannabinoid delivery and intends to file more patents to protect the intellectual property resulting from that R&D. To support these efforts, the Company will allocate additional funds of approximately $250,000 from financing proceeds to research and development, sample productions and laboratory studies.
Government Regulation
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in Colorado with respect to cannabis, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
Notwithstanding the CSA, as of the date of this filing, 33 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico allow their residents to use medical cannabis and 10 states have legalized recreational marijuana. Such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level.
 
In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA (see “-The Cole Memo”). In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidelines (the “FinCEN Guidelines”) on February 14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) obligations (see “-FinCEN”).
 
Additional existing and pending legislation provides, or seeks to provide, protection to persons acting in violation of federal law but in compliance with state laws regarding cannabis. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which funds the DOJ, prohibits the DOJ from using funds to prevent states with medical cannabis laws from implementing such laws. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment is effective through April 28, 2017, but as an amendment to an appropriations bill, it must be renewed annually. The Compassionate Access Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (the “CARERS Act”) has been introduced in the U.S. Senate, which proposes to reclassify cannabis under the CSA to Schedule II, thereby changing the plant from a federally criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses. More recently, the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, which proposes to exclude persons who produce, possess, distribute, dispense, administer or deliver marijuana in compliance with state laws from the regulatory controls and administrative, civil and criminal penalties of the CSA.

However, as of the date of this filing, neither the CARERS Act nor the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 has been enacted, the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer (formerly known as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment) has been renewed through September, 2018, and the new administration under President Trump has not yet indicated whether it will change the previously stated policy of low-priority enforcement of federal laws related to cannabis set forth in the Cole Memo or the FinCEN Guidelines. The Trump administration could change this policy and decide to strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not currently harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government. However, as of the date of this filing, we have provided products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities. As a result of our providing ancillary products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of federal law.
 
Absent any future changes in cannabis-related policies under the Trump administration, we intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo (see “-The Cole Memo”) and the FinCEN Guidelines (see “-FinCEN”), where applicable; however, we cannot provide assurance that we are in full compliance with the Cole Memo, the FinCEN Guidelines or any applicable federal laws or regulations.
 
Cole Memo
 
Because of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. The Cole Memo guidance applies to all of the DOJ’s federal enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning cannabis in all states.
 
The Cole Memo reiterates Congress’s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo notes that the DOJ is committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also notes that the DOJ is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Enforcement Priorities”) in preventing:
 

● | the distribution of cannabis to minors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; 
● | the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
● | state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
● | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 
● | drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; 
● | the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and 
● | cannabis possession or use on federal property.

We intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.
 
The Cole Memo is meant only as a guide for United States Attorneys and does not alter in any way the Department of Justice’s authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law.
 
Rohrabacher Farr Amendment
 
On December 16, 2014, H.R. 83 - Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 was enacted and included a provision known as the “Rohrabacher Farr Amendment” which states:
 
None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.
 
The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment represents one of the first times in recent history that Congress has taken action indicating support of medical cannabis. The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment was renewed by Congress in 2015, but expired in September 2018. It is again up for renewal, although there is no assurance that it will be renewed.
 
The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment would appear to protect the right of the states to determine their own laws on medical cannabis use; however, the actual effects of the amendment are still unclear. The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment did not remove the federal ban on medical cannabis and cannabis remains regulated as a Schedule I controlled substance. Further, the United States Department of Justice has interpreted the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment as only preventing federal action that prevents states from creating and implementing cannabis laws - not against the individuals or businesses that actually carry out cannabis laws - and has continued to sporadically commence enforcement actions against individuals or businesses participating in the cannabis industry despite such participation being legal under state law. Whether this interpretation is appropriate is still being litigated, and, while an initial district court decision has not supported the Department of Justice’s interpretation, such decision is currently under appellate review. In addition, no matter what interpretation is adopted by the courts, there is no question that the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment does not protect any party not in full compliance with state medicinal cannabis laws.
 
Potential Changes to Federal Laws and Enforcement Priorities
 
Although the Department of Justice has stated in the Cole Memo that it is not an efficient use of limited resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis, there is no guarantee that the Department of Justice’s position will not change regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. Further, the United States has a new administration in 2017, which could introduce a less favorable cannabis enforcement policy. There can be no assurances that any future administration would not change the current enforcement policy and decide to strongly enforce the federal laws.
 
In light of the 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Gonzales v. Raich, under the commerce clause of the constitution, Congress may pass laws to criminalize the production and use of home-grown cannabis even where states have approved its use for medicinal purposes, which leads to the conclusion that the Controlled Substances Act may preempt state laws relating to any cannabis-related activity. Any such change in the federal enforcement program of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to our business. While we do not directly harvest, distribute, or distribute cannabis today, we still may be deemed to be violating federal law and may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.

Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018
 
On December 20, 2018, the United States federal government passed The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, which amends the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 concerning cannabis for the first time. Specifically, it refers to a new definition of “hemp” as being any C. Sativa plant that has Tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) below 0.3% on a dry weight basis. The effect of this act is to legalize hemp or, in other words, strains of cannabis with low THC.
 
Legalizing strains that are low in THC is important for the nascent cannabis industry. Hemp is a great source of cannabidiol (“CBD”). As at the date hereof, CBD has been legalized in some form or another in all but 3 states – Idaho, Nebraska and South Dakota. So legalizing its production, even with significant oversight, opens the door for legal cannabis growing in the United States in a way that has not been available to farms, companies, and consumers since the at the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.
