Item 1. Business
 A. H. Belo Corporation and subsidiaries are referred to collectively herein as “A. H. Belo” or the “Company.” The Company, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is the leading local news and information publishing company in Texas with commercial printing, distribution and direct mail capabilities, as well as a presence in emerging media and digital marketing. While focusing on extending the Company’s media platforms, A. H. Belo delivers news and information in innovative ways to a broad range of audiences with diverse interests and lifestyles.
 ﻿
 A. H. Belo Corporation was formed in February 2008 through a spin-off from its former parent company and is registered on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE trading symbol: AHC). The Company publishes The Dallas Morning News (www.dallasnews.com), Texas’ leading newspaper and winner of nine Pulitzer Prizes, and various niche publications targeting specific audiences. Its newspaper operations also provide commercial printing and distribution services to large national and regional newspapers and other businesses in the North Texas region. In December 2017, the Company completed the sale of the Denton Record-Chronicle and the Company no longer owns newspaper operations in Denton, Texas.
 ﻿
 The Company also provides digital marketing solutions to businesses. The predominance of these services were developed or acquired within the last five years and are provided through the Company’s marketing services division and through its subsidiary DMV Digital Holdings Company (“DMV Holdings”).

 Business Overview
 ﻿
 The Company’s goal is to create value for investors through the following:
 ﻿

· | Be the premier provider of relevant and original local journalism in North Texas so citizens can make informed choices about their lives and the life of the communities in which they live. This commitment to excellence in journalism attracts and retains subscribers to both the print edition and digital site and applications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Provide customers with a comprehensive suite of innovative marketing solutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Since the Company’s spin-off in 2008, the print media industry has encountered continuous declines in revenue primarily due to the secular shift of readers and advertisers to digital platforms. The Company has sought to limit its exposure to these industry risks through greater development and enhancement of digital platforms for delivery of news and advertising, and through diversification of sources of revenue from both organic growth and acquisitions of marketing services.
 ﻿
 In 2017, the Company acquired the remaining 20 percent voting interest in DMV Holdings. The initial purchase of 80 percent voting interest in DMV Holdings occurred in January 2015. DMV Holdings holds all outstanding ownership interests of three Dallas-based companies, Distribion, Inc. (“Distribion”), Vertical Nerve, Inc. (“Vertical Nerve”) and CDFX, LLC (“MarketingFX”). These businesses specialize in local marketing automation, search engine marketing, and direct mail and promotional products, respectively. The Company believes this acquisition complements the product and service offerings currently available to A. H. Belo customers, thereby strengthening the Company’s diversified product portfolio and allowing for greater penetration in a competitive advertising market. Additionally, the Company has realized efficiencies through internal fulfillment of work that businesses previously out-sourced to third-party vendors and therefore can provide businesses a more comprehensive suite of marketing solutions. This complements the organic growth realized from the product and service offerings currently available to A. H. Belo customers, including content development, social media management, and multi-channel marketing solutions through targeted and programmatic exchanges. These marketing services have been combined into a single division titled Belo + Company.
 ﻿
 The Company has redesigned and expanded its website platforms and mobile apps to provide a better customer experience with its digital news and information reporting. In 2017, the Company invested in and moved to a new corporate office in downtown Dallas that provides for a more flexible office space and a contemporary digital newsroom.
 ﻿
 In the first quarter of 2017, the Company reorganized its two reportable segments based on changes in reporting structure and the go-to-market for the Company’s service and product offerings. The two reportable segments are Publishing and Marketing Services. The results of operations related to the Company’s segments are presented in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 ﻿
 The Company’s Publishing segment includes the operations of The Dallas Morning News (www.dallasnews.com), Texas’ leading newspaper and winner of nine Pulitzer Prizes, and various niche publications targeting specific audiences. These operations generate revenue from sales of advertising within its newspaper and digital platforms, subscription and retail sales of its newspapers, commercial printing and distribution services, primarily related to national and regional newspapers, and preprint advertising. Businesses within the Publishing segment leverage its production facilities, subscriber and advertiser base, and digital news platforms to provide additional contribution margin. 
 ﻿
 The Marketing Services segment includes marketing services generated by DMV Holdings and its subsidiaries Distribion, Vertical Nerve and MarketingFX. The Marketing Services segment also includes digital advertising through Connect (programmatic advertising). The Company operates this integrated portfolio of assets within its Marketing Services segment as separate businesses that sell digital marketing and advertising through different channels, including programmatic advertising and content marketing within the social media environment.
 ﻿
 Through the Company’s technological, capital and organizational investments, management will continue to focus its attention and initiatives on maximizing the return on its print assets and enhancing its digital publishing capabilities, thereby offering marketers performance-based media and marketing solutions through which they can grow their businesses.
 Publishing Segment
 ﻿
 The Dallas Morning News’ first edition was published on October 1, 1885. The Dallas Morning News is one of the leading metropolitan newspapers in the United States. The newspaper is distributed primarily in Dallas County and 10 surrounding counties. This coverage area represents one of the most populous and fastest growing metropolitan areas in the country. The Dallas Morning News has been awarded nine Pulitzer Prizes for news reporting, editorial writing and photography. The Dallas Morning News also publishes Briefing, a newspaper distributed two days per week at no charge to nonsubscribers in select coverage areas, and Al Dia, an award-winning

Spanish-language newspaper published on Wednesdays and distributed at no charge to households in select coverage areas. Unless otherwise noted, the financial and operating results of all publications are reported as The Dallas Morning News.
 ﻿
 Businesses producing and providing services within the print and paper industry have encountered significant declines in revenue as a result of increasing use of the internet for delivery of information. These businesses have been challenged to find alternative solutions to offset the loss of revenue. The majority of revenues within the newspaper industry were historically generated from display and classified advertisements followed by revenues from subscription and retail sales of newspapers. Revenues from subscription and retail sales of newspapers have experienced greater resilience as readers have been willing to pay higher prices for the product, which has substantially offset lower circulation volumes. Since the spin-off from its former parent company in 2008, the Company has faced ongoing revenue declines primarily in advertising.
 ﻿
 The following describes the various revenue streams within the Publishing segment.
 ﻿
 Advertising Revenue - Advertising revenue accounted for approximately 46 percent of total revenue within the Publishing segment for 2018. The Company has a comprehensive portfolio of print and digital advertising products, which include display, classified, preprint and digital advertising. Display revenue results from sales of advertising space within the Company’s core newspapers and niche publications to local, regional or national businesses with local operations, affiliates or resellers. Classified revenue, which includes automotive, real estate, employment, obituaries and other, results from sales of advertising space in the classified and other sections of the Company’s newspapers. Preprint revenue results from sales of preprinted advertisements or circulars inserted into the Company’s core newspapers and niche publications, or distributed by mail or third-party distributors to households in targeted areas in order to provide total market coverage for advertisers. The Company’s capabilities allow its advertisers to selectively target preprint distribution at the sub-zip code level in order to optimize coverage for the advertisers’ locations. Digital publishing revenue includes the sales of banner, classified and native advertisements on the Company’s news and entertainment-related websites and mobile apps. The Company’s auto sales division offers targeted advertising to auto dealerships primarily in the North Texas region desiring to advertise their inventory on the cars.com platform. The Company is under contract to sell this advertising through September 2019.
 ﻿
 In addition to daily newspapers, the Company publishes niche publications that provide a vehicle for delivery of display, classified, and preprint advertising, typically to nonsubscribers of the Company’s core newspapers and at no charge. These publications target specific demographic groups, geographies and nonsubscriber households. Most niche publications have related websites and mobile applications, allowing digital access by consumers. The niche publications provide unique content and incorporate the news content from the core newspaper while leveraging the Company’s printing, distribution and technology infrastructure to print and distribute their publications at lower costs. From time to time, the Company produces magazines or special newspaper editions to promote business, sporting or other events in the North Texas region, such as the Top 100 Places to Work edition. These publications allow the Company to generate revenue through advertising sales in the publications and through increased circulation or fees for the publications. 
 ﻿
 Circulation Revenue - Circulation revenue includes subscription and single copy sales related to the Company’s core newspapers in print and digital formats. A. H. Belo’s steadfast commitment to producing superior, unduplicated local journalism enables the Company’s newspapers to charge premium subscription rates. The Dallas Morning News’ goal is to maximize the amount of recurring revenue from consumers of the Company’s print and digital products. The Company continuously assesses the journalism provided to subscribers and their willingness and ability to pay higher rates by geographic area. Each year since 2008, the Company has implemented effective rate increases to select subscribers or retailers. A digital replica version of The Dallas Morning News is offered on dallasnews.com for subscribers to purchase if they prefer to consume news through a digital device in a more traditional format. 
 ﻿
 The Company’s news websites, including dallasnews.com and aldiadallas.com, are leading English and Spanish news and entertainment digital platforms in the North Texas region. The news websites offer users late-breaking and other up-to-date news coverage, user-generated content, advertising, e-commerce and other services. Readers can access news content across multiple digital platforms and obtain relevant local customized content and advertising. The Company’s journalists have expanded their reach and deepened their engagement with audiences by delivering news and content through social media platforms, such as blogs, Facebook and Twitter, which direct traffic to its core websites.
 ﻿
 Printing, Distribution and Other Revenue - Printing, distribution and other revenue accounted for approximately 14 percent of total revenue within the Publishing segment for 2018 and includes commercial printing, distribution, direct mail and event-based services. The Company provides commercial printing and distribution services, leveraging the capacity of its production and distribution assets. The Company believes the incremental revenue from these services allows a greater return on the Company’s operating assets.
 ﻿
 Commercial printing services are provided for certain national newspapers that require regional printing and for various local and regional newspapers. Newsprint used in the production of large national newspapers is generally provided by the customer. Home delivery and retail outlet distribution services are also provided for other national and regional newspapers delivered into the Company’s coverage areas. A direct mail business is operated in Phoenix, Arizona, providing mailed advertisements for its business customers.

 Marketing Services Segment
 ﻿
 The following describes the various revenue streams within the Marketing Services segment.
 ﻿
 Digital marketing services are offered by the Company’s sales and marketing divisions. The Company’s strategy, with regard to the Marketing Services segment, is to be able to offer businesses a comprehensive marketing solutions package while providing a greater percentage of the marketing fulfillment costs internally that was previously outsourced to third-party providers. The Company has aligned management and the Company’s sales teams to provide a cross-functional integrated approach to maximize the development of these businesses. Digital marketing services are provided through the following service offerings:
 ﻿

· | Multi-channel marketing solutions through subscription sales of the Company’s cloud-based software, allowing customers to manage and individualize their marketing campaigns. In addition, multi-channel marketing services are provided to customers without access to the proprietary software.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Provide marketing analytics, search engine marketing and other marketing related services to businesses across the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Social media account management and content marketing services principally for businesses in the North Texas region.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Multi-channel advertising campaigns for its customers, allowing customers to target demographic audiences using data analytics and allowing customers to determine the delivery media such as email campaign, banner impressions or video views on third-party websites. Connect is able to design and fulfill customer campaign requirements through acquisition of advertising inventory on programmatic exchanges.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Produce marketing and promotional products for businesses to supply to employees and customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Raw Materials and Distribution
 ﻿
 The basic material used in publishing newspapers is newsprint. Currently, most of the Company’s newsprint is obtained through a purchasing consortium. Management believes the Company’s sources of newsprint, along with available alternate sources, are adequate for the Company’s current needs, though the Company experienced a tightening of supply in the North American newsprint market beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 ﻿
 During 2018, Company operations consumed 19,255 metric tons of newsprint at an average cost of $660 per metric ton. Consumption of newsprint in 2017 was 23,296 metric tons at an average cost of $564 per metric ton.
 ﻿
 The Company’s newspapers and other commercial print products are produced at its facility in Plano, Texas. Distribution of printed products to subscribers, retailers and newsstands is made under terms of agreements with third-party distributors. The Company believes a sufficient number of third-party distributors exist to allow uninterrupted distribution of the Company’s products.

  ﻿
 In response to the decline in print revenue, the Company has developed or acquired capabilities to offer customers advertising and marketing solutions through multiple media channels. The Company leverages its news content to improve engagement on the Company’s digital platforms that results in increased digital subscriptions and associated revenue. The Company also continues to diversify its revenue base by leveraging the available capacity of its existing assets to provide print and distribution services for newspapers and other customers requiring these services by introducing new advertising and marketing services products, by increasing circulation prices and through growth of the Company’s event-based business. 
 ﻿
 As a result of declining print circulation, the Company has developed broad digital strategies designed to provide readers with multiple platforms for obtaining online access to local news. The Company continues to obtain additional key demographic data from readers, which allows the Company to provide content desired by readers and to modify marketing and distribution strategies to target and reach audiences valued by advertisers. The Company has implemented a programmatic digital advertising platform which provides digital ad placement and targeting efficiencies and increases utilization of digital inventory within the Company’s and external websites. 
 Strategy
 ﻿
 A. H. Belo is committed to producing quality journalism and providing innovative marketing solutions for its customers, as well as creating value for shareholders over the long-term through stock price appreciation and dividends. The Company continuously evaluates its operations and investments against various economic factors to determine the appropriate holding strategies. 
 ﻿
 In 2017, the Company completed the disposition of nonessential real estate assets, all at opportunistic prices. Sales proceeds were used to return money to shareholders and provide additional contributions to the Company’s pension plans. The Company continuously seeks to implement measures to control operating expenses as it develops and grows new businesses. These measures include divesting of unprofitable products and services, adjusting the Company’s workforce and benefits to align with revenues and market conditions, and restructuring operations. Returns on operating and investing assets are evaluated to ensure the appropriate return on investment is achieved and capital is deployed to the benefit of shareholders.

  ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 The Company’s newspapers, niche publications and related websites primarily serve audiences in the North Texas area. The Company competes for advertising revenue for its newspapers and websites with other print and digital media companies. Advertising revenues for the Company’s newspapers and websites are responsive to circulation and traffic volumes, demographics of its subscriber base, advertising results, rates and customer service. Advertising on digital platforms is highly competitive and largely dominated by large internet companies. As advertisers reallocate marketing expenditures from print to digital channels, the Company believes its strong local brand, its suite of print and digital advertising and marketing services products and its programmatic digital advertising platform will allow it to offer unique advertising and marketing solutions to local businesses on a competitive scale.
 ﻿
 The Dallas Morning News has the highest paid print circulation volumes in the North Texas area while competing with one other metropolitan newspaper in parts of its geographic market. Print circulation revenues are primarily challenged due to free and readily-accessible news, entertainment, advertising and other content available through the internet. This secular shift from print to digital media continues as consumer lifestyles embrace technological advancements, particularly with mobile devices, which provide access to a wide variety of digital news and advertising alternatives, including news and social media websites, online advertising networks and exchanges, online classified services, and direct email advertising. Competition for readers is primarily based on the mode of delivery, quality of the Company’s journalism, price, timeliness of its interaction with audiences and customer service. News and other digital content produced by the Company’s newspapers and niche publications are available via its websites, mobile applications and through email. The Company offers competitive technology for accessing digital content on mobile devices and via personal computers. Journalists engage online readers through blogs, Twitter and other social media posts. The Company has modified its websites to provide greater video content and advertising, links to other sites sought by readers, improved layouts, and a better interface with mobile applications.
 ﻿
 Seasonality
 ﻿
 A. H. Belo’s advertising revenues are subject to moderate seasonality, with advertising revenue typically higher in the fourth calendar quarter of each year because of the holiday shopping season. The level of advertising sales in any period may also be affected by advertisers’ decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand and general economic conditions. Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 982 employees.
