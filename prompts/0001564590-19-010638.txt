 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 Ooma creates powerful connected experiences for businesses and consumers. Our smart cloud-based SaaS platform serves as a communications hub, which offers cloud-based communications solutions, smart security and other connected services. Our business and residential solutions deliver our proprietary PureVoice high-definition voice quality, advanced functionality and integration with mobile devices, at competitive pricing and value. Our platform helps create smart workplaces and homes by providing communications, monitoring, security, automation, productivity and networking infrastructure applications.
 We drive the adoption of our platform by providing communications solutions to the large and growing markets for business, residential and mobile users, and then accelerate growth by offering new and innovative connected services to our user base. Our customers adopt our platform by making a one-time purchase of one of our on-premise appliances, connecting the appliance to the internet, and activating services, for which they primarily pay on a monthly basis. We believe we have achieved high levels of customer retention and loyalty by delivering exceptional quality and customer satisfaction. 
 Our services run on our unique platform consisting of four proprietary elements: our multi-tenant cloud service, custom on-premise appliance, mobile applications and end-point devices. Ooma’s cloud provides a high-quality, secure, managed, and reliable connection integrating every element of our platform. Our on-premise appliances incorporate both a custom-designed, Linux-based computer and a high-speed network router, with several key features, including wireless connectivity to end-point devices and custom firmware and software applications that are remotely upgradable and extensible to new services. Our mobile applications enable customers to access our product features from anywhere, and our end-point devices enable additional functionality and services. Our platform powers all aspects of our business, not only providing the infrastructure for the communications portion of our business, but also enabling a number of other current and future valuable productivity, automation, monitoring, safety, security and networking infrastructure applications. 
 We primarily offer our solutions in the U.S. and Canadian markets. We believe that our differentiated platform and our long-term customer relationships uniquely position us to add new connected services and exploit adjacent markets, all without significant capital investment or high customer acquisition costs to drive their adoption. We believe that our platform is particularly well-suited to enable the delivery of connected services because it is always on, monitored and interactive. We expect the adoption of our connected services to support the continued growth of our recurring revenue stream.
 We have experienced strong revenue and user growth in recent periods, growing our Ooma Business and Ooma Residential core users from approximately 858,000 as of January 31, 2017 to approximately 976,000 as of January 31, 2019, representing growth of approximately 14% over two fiscal years. We believe that we have one of the lowest customer churn rates in the industry, with an average annual core user churn rate of approximately 10% for the year ended January 31, 2019. Our total revenue was $129.2 million, $114.5 million and $104.5 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Subscription and services revenue, which primarily includes the recurring portion of our total revenue, has increased as a percentage of our total revenue over the last three years, from approximately 87% in fiscal 2017 to 90% in fiscal 2019. We have continued to make significant investments in research and development, brand marketing, and channel development, incurring net losses of ($14.6) million, ($13.1) million and ($12.9) million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Tax and Depreciation and Amortization and other non-GAAP measures (“Adjusted EBITDA”) was ($1.9) million, ($0.2) million and ($1.4) million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” below for additional information, including non-GAAP reconciliations.
 We were incorporated in 2003 as a Delaware corporation and our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “OOMA.” Our corporate headquarters is located 
in Sunnyvale, California.

Our Talkatone mobile app is available to anyone with an iOS or Android mobile device. Users download the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play for free. Users select a phone number that they can use to make free U.S. and Canada calls and texts using a Wi-Fi or cellular data connection within and out of network. Advertising is displayed within the Talkatone mobile app and users can purchase premium services such as ad-free usage and international calling plans. 
Segment Information
 We operate in one industry segment, generating revenue from two sources: (1) subscription and services revenue, which are generated from sales of subscription plans for communications services and other connected services; and (2) product and other revenue, generated primarily from the sale of on-premise appliances and end-point devices to our end-customers through our website and from sales through distributors, retailers and resellers. 
 Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who in our case is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Our subscription plans, services and product offerings operate on a single SaaS platform and our chief operating decision-maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Accordingly, we have determined that we have a single reportable segment and operating segment structure.Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing objective is to grow our customer base, and sell to our existing customers additional services using an integrated and multi-channel marketing approach. We continually test and refine our marketing and sales tactics to drive sales at a low customer acquisition cost. Our sales and marketing expenses were $40.8 million, $37.3 million, and $33.8 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Ooma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 4

Marketing and Advertising
 Traditional. We use television and radio advertising to build awareness and interest for our products and services, which benefits Ooma Business and Ooma Residential. We believe that television advertising provides an opportunity to build the Ooma brand cost-effectively, educate prospects on Ooma’s unique combination of quality and value, and capture prospects’ attention. Small businesses and consumers who see our television ads are directed to our web site, our inbound sales personnel, and/or to key retail partners. Radio is used in a highly targeted manner primarily to reach small business owners and decision makers as they commute to and from their workplace. 
 Online. We use online marketing including search engine marketing, search engine optimization, online video, digital display advertising and social media to attract customers as they do online research for the products and services we offer. We continue to reach out to our prospect leads over time using e-mail and telemarketing until they purchase or the lead is retired. 
 Word-of-mouth. We actively mobilize our customers and brand advocates to spread word-of-mouth marketing by sharing Ooma news and information through social media and e-mail. We sell additional services to our existing customer base by offering free trials and promotional offers, as well as sending e-mail communications and leaving messages on their Ooma voicemail service. 
Sales, Customers and Backlog
 Our business and residential products are sold through direct channels, retail, value-added resellers and other resellers. The direct channel and value-added resellers are our primary distribution channels for business customers and the direct and retail channel is our primary distribution channel for residential customers. Our direct sales force is focused on business sales and includes highly trained sales representatives located in the U.S. and Canada responding to inbound telephone calls and sales leads generated through marketing activity and our website and third-party web sites. 
 Our retail distribution includes national and regional consumer electronics, big box retailers and leading online retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, Costco.com, Walmart and others. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.
 We generally sign monthly and annual contracts for our subscriptions and invoice our customers on a monthly basis for the services purchased. Products are generally shipped and billed shortly after receipt of an order. We do not believe that our product backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue in any given period as such orders may be rescheduled or cancelled without penalty prior to shipment. The majority of our product revenue comes from orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter. 
Customer Support 
 Our primary customer support objective is to satisfy our customers and educate them on the features and benefits of our products to optimize the overall user experience. We employ an active customer management strategy in which we drive incremental revenue through cross-selling of products and services. Our customer support teams also manage the porting process for our customers as well as billing and payment activities. 
 We maintain two customer contact centers: one operated by us in Newark, California, which primarily supports our small business customers, and the other operated by a third-party provider in Manila, Philippines, which primarily supports our residential customers. In addition, our office located in Vancouver, British Columbia support our enterprise customers. We utilize a variety of communication media to serve the needs of our customers including telephone, online chat, online tutorials and e-mail. 
 Engineering, Research and Development
 We take an integrated approach to the development of our technology. Our extensive engineering resources span both hardware and software and our business scope encompasses the entire platform, giving us the ability to drive new integrated solutions for our customers. We believe our integrated engineering and business strategy is a significant competitive advantage and makes it feasible for us to leverage our platform to deliver a broad range of productivity, automation and infrastructure connected services.Ooma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 5

We have invested significant time and resources into developing our engineering, research and development team, resulting in a group with diverse skills, ranging from digital and radio frequency hardware design to embedded software, network software, telecommunications, database architecture, operations support systems, billing, security, web design and mobile app development. Because our team develops and manages all aspects of our solutions, we are able to offer an integrated solution that works seamlessly between software and hardware and respond to customer feedback to add in additional features and services that work across the entire platform. Our team consists of a core set of engineers located primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area, augmented by development teams in a number of international locations. 
 Our research and development expenses were $33.9 million, $29.3 million and $24.2 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Our Platform 
 Our unique hybrid SaaS platform consists of our proprietary cloud, on-premise appliances, mobile applications and end-point devices. They work in concert to support our advanced features, high-quality and the ability to offer customized connected services, which are vital to driving our high level of customer satisfaction and low customer churn. The integrated approach to our technology allows us to operate at a reduced cost and provides competitive advantages: 
  
• | Because we designed our on-premise appliances and network elements to work in harmony, we are free to make optimizations that streamline and simplify the elements of the network.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our platform enables us to automatically select, on a call-by-call basis, between over a number of call termination providers based on cost and call quality. Likewise, our platform allows us to shift our customer base among several origination vendors. This, combined with our rapid growth creates a favorable environment to demand low costs from our vendors without sacrificing quality.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The tight integration between our engineering and operations teams, combined with the functional nature of our on-premise appliances, facilitates our highly automated network operations, enabling us to efficiently scale our operations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cloud Infrastructure 
 Our multi-tenant cloud infrastructure provides a high-quality, secure, managed and reliable suite of services integrating all elements of the platform. We have built a proprietary cloud in order to optimize quality of service, reliability and security, which are essential elements of our communications solutions. Our cloud simplifies the task of offering new services, and provides consistent performance and economies of scale for all of our connected services. Ooma’s key cloud capabilities include: telecommunications, custom hosted services, interconnections to third party services (cloud-to-cloud), on-premise appliance management, remote diagnostics support and billing. 
 On-Premise Appliances 
 Our purpose-built on-premise appliances are both a custom-designed, Linux-based computer and a high-speed network router, with several key features, including wireless connectivity to end-point devices and custom firmware and software applications that are remotely upgradable and extensible to new services. 
 Mobile Applications 
 We have made significant investments in developing mobile applications for the iOS and Android operating systems. As a result, nearly every connected service and feature we deploy enhances or can be enhanced through integration with our customer’s mobile device. In fiscal 2018, we integrated our PureVoice HD technology into the Ooma Mobile HD app. We plan to continue enhancing our mobile apps to incorporate features related to our partners’ services and other connected services. 
Operations and Manufacturing 
 We deliver our services through two separate data centers located in Northern California and Virginia, both hosted in third-party leased facilities. While our service operations are partially redundant, account provisioning and billing are operated out of the San Jose facility. Our network operations and carrier operations teams are responsible for designing our core routing and switching infrastructure, managing growth and maintenance (including the introduction of new services) and orchestrating vendor relationships for hosted services, IP transit and carrier services and daily operation of our cloud and other services. The design of these services, and the tools for monitoring and managing them, are developed in combination with our engineering team. 
 Ooma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 6

We primarily contract with manufacturers in China to produce our on-premise appliances and end-point devices. We also contract with a manufacturer in Israel to produce components of our smart security solutions. We configure and ship to our channel partners and end users through our internal manufacturing and logistics team based in Newark, California. Our internal logistics team also manages reverse logistics for channel and warranty returns and works closely with our engineering team to develop tooling and processes that bring new products into production. 
Competition
 The market for communications solutions and other connected services for small business, home and mobile users is complex, fragmented and defined by constant shifts in technology and customer demands. We expect competition to continue increasing in the future. We believe that the defining factors driving competition in our market include: 

• | Quality and consistency of communications services;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Lifetime value of initial investment and ongoing cost of services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Breadth of features and capabilities;
--+--------------------------------------


• | System reliability, availability and performance;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Speed and ease of activation, setup, and configuration;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Ownership and control of the proprietary technology;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Integration with multiple end-point devices and mobile solutions; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer satisfaction and brand loyalty; and
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Ability to effectively access reseller channels
--+------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. We face competition from a broad range of providers of communications solutions and other connected services for business, home and mobile users. Some of these competitors include: 
  
• | Established communications providers, such as AT&T Inc., Comcast Corporation and Verizon Communications Inc. and Rogers Communications Inc;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other communications companies such as 8x8 Inc., Coredial LLC, Evolve IP LLC, Intermedia.net Inc., RingCentral Inc. and Vonage Holdings Corp;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Traditional on-premise, hardware business communications providers such as Avaya Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc. and Mitel, Inc.;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mobile communications app companies providing “over-the-top” solutions, such as LINE Corporation, Pinger Inc., Viber (Rakuten, Inc.) and WhatsApp Inc.; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large internet companies offer services with features that compete with some of what we offer. These include Amazon, through its platform and Alexa free calling service, as well as Google through its free calling service, Google Voice, and the Google Home personal assistant device, for which Google launched a free outbound calling service.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All of these companies currently or may in the future host their solutions through the cloud.
 We also face competition in the home security market from (i) established providers such as Arlo Technologies Inc., SimpliSafe and ADT, as well as from (ii) home security offerings such as Nest Secure and Ring Protect, an Amazon company.
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties, as well as other contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We control access to our software, documentation and other proprietary information, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. 
 Ooma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 7

As of January 31, 2019, we had 16 issued patents and 14 patent applications pending in the U.S., and 7 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions, all of which are associated with U.S. applications. Our issued patents will expire approximately between 2031 and 2035. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any issued patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We are also a party to various license agreements with third parties who typically grant us the right to use certain third-party technology in conjunction with our products and services, or to integrate software into our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. Despite the foregoing protections, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate our rights or to copy or obtain and use our proprietary technology to develop products and services with the same functionality as ours. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult and enforcing our intellectual property rights is expensive and uncertain. 
 Although our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights, we believe the technological and creative skills of our personnel, the development of new features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our products and services are the primary methods of establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. 
 Employees 
 As of January 31, 2019, we had 684 full-time employees and contractors. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe that our employee relations are good. We also contract with third-party contractors whose employees or subcontractors’ employees perform services for us. 
Regulatory Matters 
 Traditional telephone service historically has been subject to extensive federal and state regulation, while Internet services generally have been subject to less regulation. Because some elements of VoIP resemble the services provided by traditional telephone companies and others resemble the services provided by internet service providers, the VoIP industry has not fit easily within the existing framework of telecommunications law and until recently has developed in an environment largely free from regulation. The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), the U.S. Congress, and various regulatory bodies in the states and in foreign countries have begun to assert regulatory authority over VoIP providers and are continuing to evaluate how VoIP will be regulated in the future. 
Federal Regulation
 As a provider of internet communications services, we are subject to a number of FCC regulations. Among others, these regulatory obligations include: contributing to the Federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund and federal programs related to phone number administration; providing access to E-911 services; protecting customer information; and porting phone numbers upon a valid customer request. If we do not comply with any current or future rules or regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, may have to restructure our service offerings, exit certain markets or raise the price of our services, any of which could ultimately harm our business and results of operations. 
State Regulation
 The FCC has preempted much regulation of internet voice communications services. However, a number of states have ruled that non-nomadic internet voice communications services may or do fall within the definition of “telecommunications services” or are otherwise within state telecommunications regulatory jurisdiction and therefore those states assert that they have authority to regulate the service. Although no states currently require certification for nomadic internet voice communications service providers, a number of states have imposed certain traditional telecommunications requirements on such services. For example, a number of states require us to contribute to state USF and E-911 and pay other surcharges, which are passed through to our customers, while others are actively considering extending their public policy programs to include the services we provide. We expect that state public utility commissions will continue their attempts to apply state telecommunications regulations to internet voice communications services like ours. 
 Ooma | FY2019 Form 10-K | 8

International Regulation
 As we expand internationally, we will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which we offer our services. Regulatory treatment of internet communications services outside the U.S. varies from country to country, is often unclear, and may be more onerous than imposed on our services in the U.S. In Canada, our service is regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (“CRTC”) which, among other things, imposes requirements similar to the U.S. related to the provision of E-911 services in all areas of Canada where the traditional telephone carrier offers such 911 services. Our regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand internationally, and on the use of our services in international locations.
