ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (formerly known as Skyline Corporation), an Indiana corporation, and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) combined their operations pursuant to the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between Skyline Corporation and Champion Holdings. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Champion Holdings contributed to Skyline Corporation all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Champion Holdings’ wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Champion Home Builders, Inc. (“CHB”), and CHB International B.V. (“CIBV”) (the shares of stock of CHB and CIBV contributed to Skyline Corporation, the “Contributed Shares”), and in exchange for the Contributed Shares, Skyline Corporation issued to the members of Champion Holdings, in the aggregate, 47,752,008 shares of Skyline Corporation common stock, $0.0277 par value per share (such issuance, the “Shares Issuance”). The contribution of the Contributed Shares by Champion Holdings to the Corporation, and the Shares Issuance by Skyline Corporation to the members of Champion Holdings are collectively referred to herein as the “Exchange.”
 The Exchange was treated as a purchase of the Company by Champion Holdings for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result, the financial results for all periods presented prior to the Exchange are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings. 
 We are the largest independent publicly traded factory-built housing company in North America with pro forma net sales in fiscal year 2019 of $1.4 billion. We have more than 65 years of homebuilding experience, approximately 7,000 employees and 36 manufacturing facilities located in 17 states across the United States and three provinces in western Canada at March 30, 2019. We offer a leading portfolio of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs and modular buildings for the multi-family, hospitality, senior and workforce housing sectors. Our facilities are strategically located to serve strong markets in the United States and western Canada. We operate 12 manufacturing facilities in the top 10 states for total number of manufactured home shipments in 2018 as well as 15 manufacturing facilities in the top 10 fastest growing states for manufactured home shipments over the last ten years. We believe that we maintain the following leading positions in the factory-built housing industry in the United States and western Canada based on units produced in 2018:
  
• | Number two position in the manufactured housing market segment in the United States
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Top three position in most major U.S. regional markets
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | A leading position in western Canada
--+-------------------------------------


• | A leading position in park model RV sales and modular home sales
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our leading positions are driven by our comprehensive product offering, strong brand reputation, broad manufacturing footprint, and our complementary retail and logistics businesses. Our market segment share in the United States manufactured housing market segment has increased from 8% in the beginning of fiscal 2011 to 17% in fiscal 2019 based on total number of units produced. We design and build a range of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, and commercial structures. We believe that the high quality and broad scope of our product and service offerings provide us a competitive advantage relative to other factory-built and certain site-built homes. With our strong and award winning product designs, we seek to meet the needs of our localized customers, while also providing them with customizable options. Our leading brands are marketed and distributed through a network of independent and company-owned retailers, community operators, government agencies, and commercial developers. We build homes under some of the most well known brand names in the factory-built housing industry including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada.
 In addition to our core home building business, we operate a factory-direct retail business, Titan Factory Direct, with 21 sale centers spanning the southern United States, and Star Fleet Trucking, which provides transportation services to the manufactured housing and other industries from several dispatch locations across the United States.
We have a proven ability to distribute orders efficiently across our manufacturing footprint based on market demand, workforce availability, and our surrounding distribution capabilities. We are standardizing our manufacturing processes and employing metrics-driven accountability measures across all of our facilities. We also believe we have a scalable plant network including five idle manufacturing plants to support future growth in the factory-built housing market segment. 
 3

We intend to capitalize on favorable demand drivers and demographic trends, underutilized capacity within our manufacturing plant footprint, a pipeline of operational initiatives, product expansion, and plant and retail sales center acquisition opportunities to support our future growth initiatives. The manufactured housing industry, which currently represents about 10% of total home starts, is expected to grow faster than the broader single-family housing market segment, and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from that industry dynamic. We believe our idle manufacturing plants provide us with the ability to grow with increasing demand. We also believe that our national scale and competitive advantages enable us to capture market segment share from competitors and make selective value enhancing acquisitions. We have a proven track-record of executing and integrating acquisitions and plant openings having successfully completed three acquisitions and three openings of idle facilities over the last five years.
 The terms "Skyline Champion," "us," "we," "our," the "Company," and any other similar terms refer to Skyline Champion Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated in this Annual Report.
 Corporate Information 
 Skyline Champion Corporation was originally incorporated in Indiana in 1959 as Skyline Corporation. Following the completion of the Exchange, we changed our name to Skyline Champion Corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 2520 By-Pass Road, Elkhart, Indiana 46515. Our website is located at www.skylinechampion.com. Our website and the information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this Annual Report.Business Strategies
 We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to profitably grow our revenue at a rate in excess of the broader single-family housing market segment in the United States, as well as improve our operating margins by executing on the following strategic initiatives. 
Capitalize on Favorable Manufactured Housing Demand Drivers
 There have been a number of recent favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 65 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers and the population of households earning less than $50,000 per year. We intend to capitalize on these trends and drivers to grow our business. We believe that there is an opportunity for continued manufactured and modular construction market segment expansion driven by the foregoing trends and demand drivers, as well as construction labor shortages in certain regions (which tend to adversely and disproportionally impact supply and cost of site-built homes when compared to manufactured housing) and increased affordability of factory-built homes relative to site-built homes. We will seek to capture additional demand from manufactured housing communities that increase spending on expansion and development projects. In addition, if financing availability continues to improve and related regulation continues to ease, we believe that there will be an increase in the number of prospective customers who qualify for home loans for manufactured and modular homes. Finally, as one of only a limited number of manufactured homebuilders who have been approved for contracts with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”), and have historically provided housing assistance requirements following natural disasters and other housing emergencies.
 Expand Sales in Existing, Adjacent and New Geographies and Segments
 We design, produce, market, and transport a range of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, and commercial solutions. We believe the broad scope of our product and service offerings provide us advantages relative to other factory-built housing companies.
 We have a track record of sales growth and have demonstrated our ability to broaden our manufacturing and retail presence through the successful execution of a balanced organic growth and acquisition-based strategy. We are focused on meeting increasing demand by using additional capacity within our existing operating footprint, opening idle manufacturing facilities, and by expanding existing plants in selected geographies. We have continued to grow our distribution through community relationships, park model sales, commercial and modular solutions and expanded retail operations. 
 
We have also continued to develop relationships with manufactured housing finance providers to further accelerate our revenue growth opportunities. We intend to continue to expand our commercial platform. For example, in the hospitality sector we have increased our commercial construction visibility working with a leading global hospitality brand. We also intend to explore opportunities to acquire additional retail locations, manufacturing facilities, and factory-built housing competitors to supplement our organic growth initiatives.

Continue to Implement Operational Initiatives to Further Enhance Margins
 We have been able to expand our operating margins over time as a result of increased volume, reduction of our material cost structure, and company-wide efforts focused on standardization and simplification of our operations. We are currently focused on a number of ongoing operational initiatives to further enhance our operating margins, including:

• | executing on integration synergies related to identified procurement, operational and labor cost saving opportunities as well as streamlining overlapping functions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing to refine product offerings through product standardization;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhancing product value to the customer through material substitution and improved design; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | focusing on operational excellence and production efficiency through further simplification of our manufacturing process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Among other initiatives, we plan to further develop our modular platform, expand our commercial product lines, standardize our engineering and design platform, and better leverage our fixed costs from underutilized plants by routing additional demand to plants with excess capacity.
 Expand and Maintain Quality Products through Innovation and Development
 We plan to continue to innovate our home designs and home products to meet the needs of existing and new customers. We have received a number of awards from the Manufactured Housing Institute, the National Association of Home Builders, and others for our leadership in manufactured and modular home designs, craftsmanship and quality. We maintain an active dialogue with residential and commercial developers to identify demand trends and anticipate the needs of prospective homeowners. We also plan to continue to work closely with our suppliers to pilot new products and amenities, such as in-home smart technologies and luxury interior finishes.
 Factory-Built Housing
 A majority of our manufactured products are constructed in accordance with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards ("HUD code"). We produce a broad range of manufactured and modular homes under a variety of brand names and in a variety of floor plans and price ranges. While most of the homes we build are single-family, multi-section, ranch-style homes, we also build two-story, single-section, and Cape Cod style homes as well as multi-family units such as town homes, apartments, duplexes, and triplexes. The single-family homes that we manufacture generally range in size from 400 to 4,000 square feet and typically include two to four bedrooms, a living room or family room, a dining room, a kitchen and typically two full bathrooms. We also build park model RVs for resorts and campgrounds and commercial modular structures, including hotels, and student and workforce housing.
 We regularly introduce homes with new floor plans, exterior designs and elevations, decors and features. Our corporate marketing and engineering departments work with our manufacturing facilities to design homes that appeal to consumers’ changing tastes at appropriate price points for their respective markets. We design and build homes with a traditional residential or site-built appearance through the use of, among other features, dormers and higher pitched roofs. We also design and build energy efficient homes, and several of our U.S. manufacturing facilities are qualified to produce “Energy Star®” rated homes. 
 
We have received a number of awards from the Manufactured Housing Institute (“MHI”), the National Association of Home Builders, and others for our leadership in manufactured and modular home designs, craftsmanship and quality.  Most recently we were awarded the Excellence in Home Design for Modular Homes and Single Section HUD Home by the National Association for Home Builders Award and Best New Home Design Award for Modular Homes Less than 2,000 Square Feet and Modular Home over 4,000 Square Feet by MHI.
 
The components and products used in factory-built housing are generally of the same quality as those used by other home builders, including conventional site-builders. The primary components include lumber, plywood, OSB, drywall, steel, floor coverings, insulation, exterior siding (vinyl, composites, wood and metal), doors, windows, shingles, kitchen appliances, furnaces, plumbing and electrical fixtures and hardware. These components are presently available from a variety of sources and we are not dependent upon any single supplier. Prices of certain materials such as lumber, insulation, steel and drywall can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Additionally, availability of certain materials such as drywall and insulation have sometimes been limited, resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. We generally have been able to pass higher material costs on to customers in the form of surcharges and price increases.
 5

Most completed factory-built homes have cabinets, wall coverings and electrical, heating and plumbing systems. HUD-code homes also generally contain factory installed floor coverings, appliances and window treatments. Optional factory installed features include fireplaces, dormers, entertainment centers and skylights. Upon completion of the home at the factory, homes sold to retailers are transported to a retail sales center or directly to the home site. Homes sold to builders and developers are generally transported directly to the home site. After the retail sale of a stock home to the consumer, the home is transported to the home site. At the home site, the home is placed on a foundation or otherwise affixed to the property and readied for occupancy typically by setup contractors. The sections of a multi-section home are joined and the interior and exterior seams are finished at the home site. The consumer purchase of the home may also include retailer or contractor supplied items such as additional appliances, air conditioning, furniture, porches, decks and garages.
 We construct homes in indoor facilities using an assembly-line process employing approximately 100 to 200 production employees at each facility. Factory-built homes are constructed in one or more sections (also known as floors) on an affixed steel support frame that allows the sections to be moved through the assembly line and transported upon sale. The sections of many of the modular homes we produce are built on wooden floor systems and transported on carriers that are removed upon placement of the home at the home site. Each section or floor is assembled in stages, beginning with the construction of the frame and the floor, then adding the walls, ceiling and roof assembly, and other constructed and purchased components, and ending with a final quality control inspection. The efficiency of the assembly-line process, protection from the weather, and favorable pricing of materials resulting from our substantial purchasing power enables us to produce homes more quickly and often at a lower cost than a conventional site-built home of similar quality. 
 The production schedules of our homebuilding facilities are based upon customer orders, which can fluctuate from week to week. Orders from retailers are generally subject to cancellation at any time without penalty and are not necessarily an indication of future business. Retailers place orders for retail stocking (inventory) purposes and for homebuyer orders. Before scheduling homes for production, orders and availability of financing are confirmed with our customer and, where applicable, their lender. Orders are generally filled within 90 days of receipt, depending upon the level of unfilled orders and requested delivery dates.  Because we produce homes to fill existing wholesale orders, our factories generally do not carry finished goods inventories, except for homes awaiting delivery.
 Although factory-built homes can be produced throughout the year in indoor facilities, demand for homes is usually affected by inclement weather and by the cold winter months in northern areas of the U.S. and in Canada. Typically, a one to three-week supply of raw materials is maintained. Charges to transport homes increase with the distance from the factory to the retailer or home site. As a result, most of the retailers and builders/developers we sell to are located within a 500-mile radius of our manufacturing plants.
 At March 30, 2019, we had a backlog of home orders with wholesale sales values of approximately $142.7 million. After production of a particular home has commenced, the order becomes noncancelable and the retailer is obligated to take delivery of the home. In response to accelerating demand, we have raised production levels by increasing our workforce size and capabilities. However, the constrained labor market is a key challenge to further increasing production to keep pace with increased order rates. In addition, we have implemented higher product pricing to offset rising input costs, including labor and material price increases.
 We offer a wide selection of manufactured and modular homes as well as park model RVs at company-owned retail locations across Texas and the Southeast U.S. marketed under the Titan Factory Direct brand. We maintain company-owned retail presence through 21 retail sales centers in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. We have benefited from the strategic expansion of our captive distribution to enhance the reach of our factory-built housing products directly to the homebuyer.
 Each of our full-service retail sales centers has a sales office and a variety of display model homes of various sizes, floor plans, features, and prices that are displayed in a residential setting with sidewalks and landscaping. Customers may purchase a home from an inventory of homes maintained at the location, including a model home, or may order a home that will be built at a manufacturing facility. The collective benefits of our retail organization provide industry leadership with the expertise to be proactive to local economic conditions and ultimately provide affordable homes to value-conscious homebuyers.
 During fiscal 2019, the average selling price for our factory-built homes was $60,600.  Manufactured home sales prices ranged from $30,000 to over $200,000. Retail sales prices of the homes, without land, generally ranged from $35,000 to over $250,000, depending upon size, floor plan, features and options.

Logistics
 We operate a logistics business, Star Fleet, specializing in the transportation of manufactured homes and recreational vehicles from manufacturing facilities to retailers. Star Fleet’s delivery logistics are coordinated through dispatch terminals located in Idaho, Indiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Star Fleet has strong relationships with its customer base, which consists of some of the largest manufactured housing companies (including our own factory-built housing products), recreational vehicle manufacturers and related product manufacturers in the U.S.
Financing
 Commercial Financing. Independent retailers of factory-built homes generally finance their inventory purchases from manufacturers with floor plan financing provided by third party lending institutions and secured by a lien on the homes. The availability and cost of floor plan financing can affect the amount of retailer new home inventory, the number of retail sales centers and related wholesale demand. Under a typical floor plan financing arrangement, an independent financial institution specializing in this line of business provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral. The financial institution customarily requires us, as the manufacturer of the home, to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution that, upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances, obligates us to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement (which, in most cases, is 18 to 36 months). The price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon the amount financed, plus certain administrative and shipping expenses. Our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately $173.4 million as of March 30, 2019. The risk of loss under these agreements is spread over many retailers and is further reduced by the resale value of the homes.  During fiscal 2019, approximately 35% of our sales to independent retailers were financed by retailers under floor plan agreements with national lenders, while the remaining 65% were financed under various arrangements with local or regional banks or paid in cash.  We generally receive payment from the lending institution 5 to 10 days after a home is sold and invoiced to an independent retailer.
 Consumer Financing. Sales of factory-built homes are significantly affected by the availability, credit underwriting standards, and cost of consumer financing. There are three basic types of consumer financing in the factory-built housing industry: conforming mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) or Government-Sponsored Enterprise (“GSE”) loans; non-conforming mortgages for purchasers of the home and the land on which the home is placed; and personal property loans (often referred to as home-only or chattel loans) for consumers where the home is the sole collateral for the loan (generally HUD code homes).
Industry trade associations are working towards favorable legislative and GSE action to address the mortgage financing needs of potential buyers of affordable homes. Federal law requires the GSEs to issue a regulation to implement the "Duty to Serve" requirements specified in the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. FNMA and FHLMC released their final Underserved Markets Plan that describes, with specificity, the actions they will take over a three-year period to fulfill the "Duty to Serve" obligation. These plans became effective on January 1, 2018. Each of the three-year plans is intended to establish steps to ensure home-only loans can be purchased in bulk prior to proceeding with a pilot program to purchase these loans. Expansion of the secondary market for home-only lending through the GSEs could provide further demand for housing, as lending options would likely become more available to home buyers. Although some limited progress has been made in this area, meaningful positive impact in the form of increased home orders has yet to be realized.   In the second half of 2018, the GSEs also rolled out real property programs targeting to acquire over 12,000 land home purchase mortgages in 2019.
 Market Overview 
 General. Factory-built housing provides an alternative to other forms of new low-cost housing such as site-built housing and condominiums, and to existing housing such as pre-owned homes and apartments. According to statistics published by the Institute for Building Technology and Safety ("IBTS") and the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, for the 2018 calendar year, manufactured housing wholesale shipments of homes constructed in accordance with the HUD code accounted for an estimated 10.5% of all new single-family homes starts.

According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute ("MHI"), industry home shipments continue to improve, increasing to approximately 93,377 HUD code (or 93,265 excluding FEMA) units shipped during fiscal year 2019, compared to the 95,044 (or 90,629 excluding FEMA) units shipped during fiscal year 2018 and 85,550 (or 81,346 excluding FEMA) units shipped in fiscal year 2017. Annual shipments have increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD code manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD code manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, the manufactured housing industry continues to operate at relatively low levels compared to historical shipment statistics.
 The market for factory-built housing is affected by a number of factors, including the availability, cost and credit underwriting standards of consumer financing, consumer confidence, employment levels, general housing market, interest rates and other economic conditions and the overall affordability of factory-built housing versus other forms of housing. In the past, a number of factors have restricted demand for factory-built housing, including, in some cases, less-favorable financing terms compared to site-built housing, the effects of restrictive zoning on the availability of certain locations for home placement and, in some cases, an unfavorable public image. Certain of these adverse factors have lessened considerably in recent years with the improved quality and appearance of factory-built housing. 
 Home Buyer Demographics. We believe the segment of the housing market in which manufactured housing is most competitive includes consumers with household incomes under $60,000. This segment has a high representation of young single persons and married couples, first time home buyers and elderly or retired persons. The comparatively low cost of manufactured homes attracts these consumers. People in rural areas, where fewer housing alternatives exist, and those who presently live in factory-built homes, also make up a significant portion of the demand for new factory-built housing. We believe higher-priced, multi-section manufactured and modular homes are attractive to households with higher incomes as an alternative to rental housing and condominiums, and are well suited to meet the needs of the retiree buyer in many markets.
 The two largest manufactured housing consumer demographics, Millennials (generally defined as those born between 1981 – 1996) and Baby Boomers (generally defined as those born between 1946 – 1964), comprise the fastest growing populations. Millennials are generally first-time home buyers who may be attracted by the affordability, and diversity of style choices of factory-built homes. Baby Boomers are similarly interested in the value proposition; however, they are also motivated by the energy efficiency and low maintenance requirements of factory-built homes, and by the lifestyle offered by planned communities that are specifically designed for homeowners that fall into this age group.
 Competition
 The factory-built housing industry is highly competitive at both the manufacturing and retail levels, with competition based upon several factors, including price, product features, reputation for service and quality, depth of distribution, and retail customer financing. Capital requirements for entry into the industry are relatively low.
 According to MHI, in 2018, there were 35 producers of manufactured homes in the U.S. operating an estimated 133 production facilities. For calendar year 2018, the top 3 companies had a combined market share of HUD-code homes of approximately 77%, according to data published by Statistical Surveys, Inc. We estimate that there were approximately 4,000 industry retail locations throughout the U.S. during calendar year 2018. 
 Based on industry data reported by IBTS, in calendar year 2018 our U.S. wholesale market share of HUD-code homes sold was 16.3%, compared to 13.9% in calendar year 2017. We compete with approximately 34 other producers of manufactured homes, as well as companies offering for sale homes repossessed from wholesalers or consumers. In addition, manufactured homes compete with new and existing site-built homes, as well as apartments, townhouses and condominiums.
 There are a number of other national manufacturers competing for a significant share of the manufactured housing market in the U.S., including Clayton Homes, Inc. and Cavco Industries. Certain of these competitors may possess greater financial, manufacturing, distribution and marketing resources.

Government Regulation
 Our manufactured homes are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations. The majority of our homes are built to comply with the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended, and the rules enacted thereunder.  Collectively known as the “HUD Code”, these regulations cover all aspects of manufactured home construction and installation, including structural integrity, fire safety, wind loads, thermal protection and ventilation. To the extent state and local regulations conflict with the HUD Code they are pre-empted. Our modular homes and commercial structures are built to comply with applicable state and local building codes.  Our park model RV’s are built in conformance with the applicable ANSI standards. 
 A variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture. The Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act ("Truth-in-Lending Act") and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder require written disclosure of information relating to such financing, including the amount of the annual percentage interest rate and the finance charge. A variety of state laws also regulate the form of financing documents and the allowable deposits, finance charge and fees chargeable pursuant to financing documents.
 In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act") was passed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act was a sweeping piece of legislation designed to reform credit and lending practices after the global credit crisis of 2008. Although many rules have been implemented, the full impact will not be known for years as rule revisions and the enforcement of the rules continue to evolve. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Reform Act") was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Reform Act revises portions of the Dodd-Frank Act, reduces the regulatory burden on smaller financial institutions, including eliminating provisions of the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 ("SAFE Act"), and protects consumer access to credit. With the elimination of certain provisions of the SAFE Act, manufactured housing retailers can now assist home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes; however, they may not assist in negotiating the financing terms. This may enable buyers to more easily find access to financing. 
 The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 requires the GSEs to facilitate a secondary market for mortgages on housing for very low, low and moderate-income families in under-served markets, including manufactured housing. On January 30, 2017, the Federal Housing Finance Agency issued a final rule specifying the scope of GSE activities that are eligible to receive credit for compliance with the "Duty to Serve" rule after January 2018. On December 18, 2017, Both GSEs published their final Underserved Markets Plans for activities for the years beginning January 1, 2018, and continuing through 2020. Both GSEs have introduced initiatives to facilitate increased purchases of real property mortgages with manufactured homes under their existing single-family programs.  In addition, both GSEs have announced plans for small-scale pilot programs for home-only (chattel) loans secured by manufactured housing.
 Governmental authorities enforcing these numerous laws and regulations can impose fines and/or seek injunctive relief for violations. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the requirements of these applicable laws and regulations. 
 Seasonality
 The housing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations based on home buyer purchasing patterns. We typically experience decreased home buyer traffic during holidays and popular vacation periods. Demand for our core single-family new home products typically peaks each spring and summer before declining in the winter, consistent with the overall housing industry, although this pattern was partially interrupted during the winter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, when we produced a limited number of disaster-relief homes for the FEMA. 
 The U.S. has experienced extreme weather events over the past few years resulting in widespread property damage. It has been widely reported that the overall economic toll in the affected market areas that have experienced severe weather events is substantial. There has been somewhat increased consumer demand for replacement of homes lost as a result of these events. This may include demand for additional disaster-relief manufactured home orders from federal and state agencies. The Company has initially participated by producing a limited number of disaster-relief homes for FEMA. These homes were built in factories located in unaffected regions of the country, primarily during the winter months, which lessened disruptions to existing order demand from our core customer base.

Employees
 We have approximately 7,000 employees. We deem our relationship with our employees to be generally good. Currently, our manufacturing facilities in Canada employ approximately 850 workers, of which 700 are subject to five separate collective bargaining agreements. Two agreements, covering 400 employees, expire in November 2019 and June 2020.
