ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 We are a Delaware limited partnership primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of motor fuel and the ownership and leasing of real estate used in the retail distribution of motor fuel. We also generate revenues from the operation of retail sites.
 On June 28, 2017, a wholly owned subsidiary of Circle K merged with and into CST, with CST surviving the Merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Circle K. Circle K is a wholly owned subsidiary of Couche-Tard.
 Circle K indirectly owns all of the membership interests in the sole member of our General Partner, as well as a 21.7% limited partner interest in the Partnership and all of the outstanding IDRs of the Partnership. Circle K, through its indirect ownership interest in the sole member of our General Partner, has the ability to appoint all of the members of the Board and to control and manage the operations and activities of the Partnership. 
 Our principal executive office address is 600 Hamilton Street, Suite 500, Allentown, PA 18101, and our telephone number is (610) 625-8000. Our common units trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “CAPL.”
 The financial statements reflect the consolidated results of the Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Our primary operations are conducted by the following consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries:

Operations
 Wholesale Segment
 Our primary operation is the wholesale distribution of motor fuel. Our Wholesale segment generated 2018 revenues of $2.2 billion. We are one of the ten largest independent distributors by motor fuel volume in the United States for ExxonMobil, BP and Shell, and we also distribute Chevron, Sunoco, Valero, Gulf, Citgo, Marathon and Phillips 66-branded motor fuels (approximately 81% of the motor fuel we distributed during 2018 was branded). We receive a fixed mark-up per gallon of motor fuel on approximately 82% of gallons sold to our customers. The remaining gallons are primarily DTW priced contracts with our customers. These contracts provide for variable, market-based pricing. An increase in DTW gross profit results from the acquisition cost of wholesale motor fuel declining at a faster rate as compared to the rate that retail motor fuel prices decline. Conversely, our DTW motor fuel gross profit declines when the cost of wholesale motor fuel increases at a faster rate as compared to the rate that retail motor fuel prices increase.
 Regarding our supplier relationships, a majority of our total gallons of motor fuel purchased are subject to discounts for prompt payment and other rebates and incentives, which are recorded within cost of sales. Prompt payment discounts are based on a percentage of the purchase price of motor fuel. As such, the dollar value of these discounts increases and decreases corresponding with motor fuel prices. Therefore, in periods of lower wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is negatively affected, and, in periods of higher wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is positively affected (as it relates to these discounts). Based on our current volumes, we estimate a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil would impact our overall annual wholesale motor fuel gross profit by approximately $2 million related to these payment discounts.
 The following table highlights the aggregate volume of motor fuel distributed by our Wholesale segment to each of our principal customer groups (in millions):

The following chart depicts how motor fuel is procured and distributed to our customer groups and how convenience merchandise items are procured and distributed to our company operated retail sites. The chart also depicts the relationship of our real estate activities to our customer groups.
 
Business Strategy and Objective
 Our primary business objective is to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and, over time, to increase our quarterly cash distributions. The amount of any distribution is subject to the discretion of the Board, and the Board may modify or revoke the cash distribution policy at any time. Our Partnership Agreement does not require us to pay any distributions.
 Our business strategy to achieve our objective of paying and, over time, increasing our quarterly cash distributions, is focused on the following key initiatives:
 
 
• | Expand within and beyond our existing markets through acquisitions, either on our own or as joint acquisitions with Circle K, as demonstrated by the Jet-Pep Assets acquisition. Since our IPO and through February 20, 2019, we have completed acquisitions for a total of approximately 600 fee and leasehold sites for total consideration of approximately $1.0 billion;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimize our value chain by leveraging the combined scale and strength of Circle K to gain procurement synergies with our vendors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance our real estate business’ cash flows by owning or leasing sites in prime locations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase our Wholesale segment by expanding market share and growing rental income over time;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain strong relationships with major integrated oil companies and refiners;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convert company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites to provide for more stable cash flows and maximize qualifying income; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10

 
• | Similar to the transaction described in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments—Asset Exchange Transaction with Circle K,” we intend, when favorable market conditions exist and subject to required approvals, including approval by the Board’s independent conflicts committee, to purchase certain assets from Circle K on mutually agreeable terms, which could include a portion of the independent dealer and lessee dealer wholesale business of Circle K and certain non-core retail convenience sites of Circle K with the intent to convert them to lessee dealer sites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our competitive strengths will allow us to capitalize on our strategic opportunities, including:
 
 
• | Stable cash flows from real estate rent income and wholesale motor fuel distribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Established history of acquiring sites and successfully integrating these sites and operations into our existing business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Long-term relationships with major integrated oil companies and other key suppliers; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prime real estate locations in areas with high traffic and considerable motor fuel consumption.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supplier Arrangements
 We distribute Branded Motor Fuel under the Exxon, Mobil, BP, Shell, Chevron, Sunoco, Valero, Gulf, Citgo, Marathon and Phillips 66 brands to our customers. Branded Motor Fuels are purchased directly or indirectly through Circle K from major integrated oil companies and refiners under supply agreements. For 2018, our Wholesale segment purchased approximately 26%, 26% and 13% of its motor fuel from ExxonMobil, BP and Motiva, respectively. We purchase the motor fuel at the supplier’s applicable terminal rack price, which typically changes daily. Certain suppliers offer volume rebates or incentive payments to drive volumes and provide an incentive for branding new locations. Certain suppliers require that all or a portion of any such incentive payments be repaid to the supplier in the event that the sites are rebranded within a stated number of years. We also purchase unbranded motor fuel for distribution at a rack price. As of December 31, 2018, our supply agreements had a weighted-average remaining term of approximately 6.2 years.
 From the time of the November 2017 Jet-Pep Assets acquisition through October 31, 2018, we purchased motor fuel for our Jet-Pep Assets from Circle K at Circle K’s cost plus terminal and administration fees of $0.015 per gallon. Circle K’s cost to supply these sites included price fluctuations associated with index-based motor fuel pricing for pipeline delivery and the generation and sale of RINs. Effective November 1, 2018, we amended our contract with Circle K such that our cost is based on a rack-based price, which reduces our exposure to price fluctuations inherent in the previous pricing methodology. We are in the process of rebranding substantially all of these sites to a major fuel supplier and anticipate a positive impact on volume and fuel margin.
 Competition
 Our Wholesale segment competes with other motor fuel distributors. Major competitive factors for us include, among others, customer service, price and quality of service and availability of products.
 The convenience store industry is highly competitive and characterized by ease of entry and constant change in the number and type of retailers offering products and services of the type we sell in our retail sites. We compete with other retail site chains, independently owned retail sites, motor fuel stations, supermarkets, drugstores, discount stores, dollar stores, club stores and hypermarkets. Major competitive factors include, among others, location, ease of access, product and service selection, motor fuel brands, pricing, customer service, store appearance, and cleanliness.
 Seasonality
 Our business exhibits substantial seasonality due to our wholesale and retail sites being located in certain geographic areas that are affected by seasonal weather and temperature trends and associated changes in retail customer activity during different seasons. Historically, sales volumes have been highest in the second and third quarters (during the summer activity months) and lowest during the winter months in the first and fourth quarters.
Trade Names, Service Marks and Trademarks
 We are a wholesale distributor of motor fuel for various major integrated oil companies and are licensed to market/resell motor fuel under their respective motor fuel brands.
 We are not aware of any facts that would negatively affect our continuing use of any trademarks, trade names or service marks.
