ITEM 1.    Business.
ScanSource, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries referred to as “the Company” or “ScanSource” or “we”) is at the center of the technology solution delivery channel, connecting businesses and providing solutions for their complex needs. Using a channel sales model, we provide technology solutions and services from the world’s leading suppliers of point-of-sale (POS), payments, barcode, physical security, unified communications and collaboration, telecom and cloud services to our customers. 
Our customers are businesses of all sizes that sell to end-customers across many industries. Our customer channels include value-added resellers (“VARs”), sales partners or agents, independent sales organizations (“ISOs”) and independent software vendors (“ISVs”). These customer channels provide us with multiple routes-to-market. We align our teams, tools and processes around all of our customers to help them grow through reducing their costs, creating efficiencies and generating end-customer demand for business solutions. We enable our customers to create, deliver and manage solutions for end-customers across almost every vertical market in the United States, Canada, Brazil, additional Latin American countries and Europe. 
ScanSource was incorporated in South Carolina in 1992 and serves approximately 38,000 customers. Net sales for fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 totaled $3.9 billion. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “SCSC.” 
Strategy
We rely on a channel sales model to offer hardware, software, services and connectivity from technology suppliers to our sales partners (resellers, agents, ISOs, ISVs) to solve end-customer needs. While we do not manufacture products, we provide technology solutions and services from leading technology suppliers. Our solutions may include a combination of offerings from multiple suppliers or access to additional services, such as custom configuration, key injection, integration support custom development and other services, to deliver solutions. We also offer the flexibility of on-premise, cloud or hybrid solutions for their end-customers.
As a trusted adviser to our sales partners, we provide more complete solutions through a better understanding of end-customer needs. In addition, we drive growth through enhancing our sales partners' capabilities to provide hardware, software, services and connectivity solutions to meet these needs. Our teams deliver value-added support programs and services, including education and training, assessments, provisioning, implementation, custom development and marketing, designed to help our sales partners' develop new technology practices and reach new end-customers and deliver new solutions to their current customers.
Part of our strategy is to expand in higher margin and adjacent markets to help our sales partners offer more products and services while building recurring revenue opportunities. In fiscal 2020, we acquired intY and its CASCADE cloud services distribution platform. With intY’s CASCADE solution, we are providing our sales partners with another route to market to enable key strategic cloud services. In fiscal 2019, we acquired Canpango, a global Salesforce implementation and professional services business with deep knowledge of customer relationship management ("CRM") and integration with telecom systems. With Canpango, we added capabilities to help our sales partners sell customer experience (CX) solutions, where CRM integrates with other communications offerings. In fiscal 2018, we acquired POS Portal, a leading provider of payments devices and services primarily to the small and medium-sized (“SMB”) business segment. POS Portal added to our offerings industry-leading services and capabilities in serving the U.S. payments channel. In fiscal 2017, we acquired Intelisys, an industry-leading technology services provider (also called a master agent) of business telecommunications and cloud services. Using a master agent business model, Intelisys acts as an intermediary connecting sales partners with service providers and suppliers who offer services to end-customers. Intelisys’ sales partners earn commission payments from those service providers or suppliers on end-customer sales, typically multi-year contracts. Intelisys earns a percentage of the commission streams, building more predictable, recurring revenues. Since our Intelisys business is a services model, the working capital requirements are very low and require no inventories.

Customers
Our customers, or sales partners are businesses of all sizes that sell to end-customers across industries ranging from manufacturing, warehouse and distribution, retail and e-commerce, hospitality, transportation and logistics, government, education and health care, among others. Our customers provide us with multiple routes-to-market through various channels, including: VARs, agents, ISOs, and ISVs. No single customer accounted for more than 5% of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. 
VARs
Within VARs, our customers include specialty technology VARs, direct marketers, IT system integrators and service providers. Specialty technology VARs focus on one or more technologies, providing specialized knowledge and expertise for technology solutions, such as tailored software or integrated hardware. Direct marketers provide a very broad range of technology brands to business, government, education and healthcare markets. IT system integrators develop computer and networking solutions for end-customers’ IT needs. Service providers deliver advanced multi-discipline services with customized solutions that bundle data, collaboration, cloud, network and digital telecommunication services for end-customers' needs. 
Agents
Agents focus on selling telecommunications and cloud services to end-customers, advising about various services, technologies and cost alternatives to help them make informed choices. Agents typically earn monthly commissions on multi-year contract sales as they build their recurring revenue business.
Independent Sales Organizations
ISOs focus on selling credit card processing and finding new merchant customers for credit card member banks. They offer on-going customer service and support and look to bundle hardware, software and processing services. 
Independent Software Vendors
ISVs develop software, apps and integrated solutions. They generally focus on cloud solutions and sell or certify bundled hardware, software and service solutions.
Suppliers
We provide products and services from approximately 550 suppliers, including Axis, AudioCodes, Avaya, Barco, Bematech, Bosch, CenturyLink/Level 3, Cisco, Comcast Business, Datalogic, Dell, Elo, Epson, Exacq, Extreme, Fortinet, Hanwha, HID, Honeywell, HP/Aruba, IBM, Ingenico, Jabra, Lifesize, Microsoft, Milestone, Mitel, NCR, Panasonic, Pioneer, Plantronics/Polycom (Poly), RingCentral, Ruckus, Samsung, Spectralink, Spectrum, Star Micronics, Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions, Ubiquiti, Verifone, Verizon, Windstream, Yealink and Zebra Technologies. We also offer customers significant choices in cloud services through our Intelisys business and our intY cloud services distribution platform, including offerings in contact center, infrastructure, unified communications, security, and Microsoft offerings.
We provide products and services from many of our key suppliers in all of our geographic markets; however, certain suppliers only allow distribution to specific geographies. We typically purchase products directly from the supplier and our supplier agreements generally do not restrict us from selling similar or competitive products or services. We have the flexibility to terminate or curtail sales of one product line in favor of another due to technological change, pricing considerations, product availability, customer demand or supplier distribution policies.
Products from two suppliers, Cisco and Zebra, each constituted more than 10% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.

• | We have two non-exclusive agreements with Cisco. One agreement covers the distribution of Cisco products in the United States and has a two year term; and one agreement covers distribution of products in Brazil and has a two year term. Each of these agreements must be renewed by written agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement upon 30 days' notice to the other party.


• | We have two non-exclusive agreements with Zebra. One agreement covers sales of Zebra products in North and South America, and the other agreement covers sales of Zebra products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"). The Zebra agreements each have a one year term that automatically renews for additional one year terms, and either party may terminate the agreement upon 30 days' notice to the other party.

In addition to the agreements mentioned above, we have written agreements with almost all of our other suppliers. These agreements generally include the following terms:

• | Non-exclusive distribution rights to resell products and related services in geographical areas (vendor agreements often include territorial restrictions that limit the countries in which we can sell their products and services).


• | Short-term periods, subject to periodic renewal, and provide for termination by either party without cause upon 30 to 120 days' notice.


• | Stock rotation rights, which give us the ability, subject to limitations, to return for credit or exchange a portion of the items purchased.


• | Price protection provisions, which enables us to take a credit for declines in inventory value resulting from the vendor's price reductions.

Along with our inventory management policies and practices, these stock rotation rights and price protection provisions are designed to reduce our risk of loss due to slow-moving inventory, vendor price reductions, product updates and obsolescence.
We participate in various rebate, cash discount and cooperative marketing programs offered by our suppliers to support expenses associated with selling and marketing the suppliers' products and services. These rebates and purchase discounts are largely influenced by sales volumes and are subject to change.
Our suppliers generally warrant their products we sell and allow returns of defective products, including those returned to us by our customers. For three of our product offerings, we offer a self-branded warranty program. We purchase contracts from unrelated third parties, generally the original equipment manufacturers, to fulfill our obligations to service or replace defective product claimed on these warranty programs. To maintain customer relations, we also facilitate returns of defective products from our customers by accepting for exchange, with our prior approval, most defective products within 30 days of invoicing. In addition, local laws may in some cases impose warranty obligations on the Company.
Offerings and Markets
We currently market over 100,000 products from approximately 550 hardware, software and service suppliers to approximately 38,000 customers. We sell products and services to the U.S. and Canada from our facilities located in Mississippi, California and Kentucky; into Brazil and other parts of Latin America principally from facilities located in Florida, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Chile; and into Europe principally from facilities located in Belgium, France and the United Kingdom. See "Risk Factors," for a discussion of the risks related to our foreign operations. We also have drop-shipment arrangements with some of our suppliers, which allow us to offer products to customers without taking physical delivery at our facilities. These drop-shipment arrangements represent approximately 17% of fiscal year 2019 net sales. 
Our offerings to our customers include hardware, software, services and connectivity from leading technology suppliers, including the flexibility of on-premise, cloud and hybrid solutions. We believe that sales partners want to offer end-customers complete technology solutions that solve real business needs and drive business outcomes. We align our teams, tools, and processes to help our sales partners grow by providing more complete solutions through a better understanding of end-customers’ need. We may provide a combination of offerings from multiple suppliers or give our sales partners access to additional services, such as configuration, key injection, integration support and others to deliver solutions. 
We provide our sales partners and suppliers an array of pre-sale business tools and value-added services, including market and technology solution expertise, education and training, product configuration tools, technical support, logistics and channel financial services. These services allow our sales partners to gain knowledge and experience on marketing, negotiation and selling, to improve customer service, to profitably grow their business and be more cost effective. Our business is enhanced by our ability and our willingness to provide the extra level of services that keeps both our sales partners and our suppliers satisfied.
We bring technology solutions and services that include the following offerings:

• | POS: We provide POS solutions for retail, grocery and hospitality environments to efficiently manage in-store sales and operations. POS solutions include computer-based terminals, tablets, monitors, payment processing solutions, receipt printers, pole displays, cash drawers, keyboards, peripheral equipment and fully integrated processing units. These solutions may include self-service checkout, kiosks and products that attach to the POS network in the store, including network access points, routers and digital signage.

Index to Financial Statements


• | Payments: We offer payment terminals, comprehensive key injection services, reseller partner branding, extensive key libraries, ability to provide point-to-point encryption (“P2PE”), and redundant key injection facilities. We have the resources to deliver secure payment devices that are preconfigured and ready for use. In addition, we partner with ISVs to deliver to merchants integrated tablet POS solution hardware that a merchant may purchase outright or “as a service,” and which includes merchant hardware support and next-day replacement of tablets, terminals and peripherals.


• | Barcode: We offer automatic identification and data capture (“AIDC”) technology that incorporates the capabilities for electronic identification and data processing without the need for manual input. These solutions consists of a wide range of products that include portable data collection terminals, wireless products, bar code label printers and scanners. As AIDC technology has become more pervasive, applications have evolved from traditional uses, such as inventory control, materials handling, distribution, shipping and warehouse management, to more advanced applications, such as health care.


• | Physical Security: We provide electronic physical security solutions that include identification, access control, video surveillance and intrusion-related products and networking infrastructure. Physical security products are used every day across every vertical market to protect lives, property and information. These technology solutions require specialized knowledge to deploy effectively, and we offer in-depth training and education to our sales partners to enable them to maintain the appropriate skill levels. 


• | Unified Communications and Collaboration: We provide unified communications and collaboration capabilities, such as voice, video, audio conferencing, web conferencing and messaging. These offerings combine voice, data, fax and speech technologies with computers, telecommunications and the internet to deliver communications solutions on-premise, from the cloud and as a hybrid. Software and hardware products include IP-based telephony platforms, Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") systems, private branch exchanges (“PBXs”), call center applications, video conferencing, desk phones and other endpoints. Cloud-delivered services, such as unified communications, contact center and video conferencing, enable end-customers to consume and pay for communications services typically on a monthly subscription basis.


• | Cloud and Telecom Services: We offer business communications services, including voice, data, access, cable collaboration, wireless and cloud. We focus on empowering and educating sales partners so they can advise end-customers in making informed choices about services, technology and cost savings. With the CASCADE cloud services platform, we offer sales partners another way to grow their recurring revenue practices. CASCADE takes the friction out of acquiring, provisioning and managing XaaS offerings. We have contracts with more than 150 of the world’s leading telecom carriers and cloud services providers.

Our People
The strength of our Company is our people, working together to help our customers grow their businesses. As of June 30, 2019, we had more than 2,700 employees, of which approximately 1,600 are in the United States and 1,100 are located internationally in Canada, Brazil, other parts of Latin America and Europe. We have no organized labor or trade unions in the United States. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Competition
We believe we are a leader in the specialty markets we serve. The market for technology products and solutions is highly competitive, both in the United States and internationally. Competitive factors include price, product availability, speed and accuracy of delivery, effectiveness of sales and marketing programs, credit availability, ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, quality and breadth of product lines and services, and availability of technical and product information. 
Our competitors include local, regional, national and international distributors, as well as suppliers that sell directly to resellers and to end-customers. In addition, our competitors include master resellers that sell to franchisees, third-party dealers and end-customers. Certain current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Certain smaller, regional competitors, who are specialty two-tier or mixed model master resellers, may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and local or regional changes in customer requirements from the specialized market focus. Competition has increased over the last several years as broad line and other value-added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets. Such competition could also result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of market share.
Index to Financial Statements

In our Worldwide Barcode, Networking & Security segment, we compete with broad-line distributors, such as Ingram Micro, Synnex and Tech Data in most geographic areas, and more specialized security distributors, such as ADI and Anixter. Additionally, we also compete against other smaller, more specialized AIDC and POS distributors, such as Azerty, BlueStar, Jarltech and Nimax. In our Worldwide Communications & Services segment, we compete against broad-line distributors, such as Ingram Micro, Synnex and Tech Data, and more specialized distributors, such as Jenne and Westcon. Additionally, for Intelisys' technology services, we also compete against other smaller, master agents, such as Avant and Telarus. For our intY business, we compete against other small developers of cloud software and services platforms such as CloudBlue and Pax8. As we seek to expand our business into other areas closely related to our offerings, we may encounter increased competition from current competitors and/or from new competitors, some of which may be our current sales partners.
Sales 
Our sales department consists of inside and field sales representatives located in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Belgium, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. The majority of our sales partners are assigned to a dedicated sales representative or team whose main focus is developing customer relationships and providing the sales partners with the solutions to meet their end-customer’s needs. Our sales teams are advocates for and trusted advisers to our sales partners. Sales teams are often responsible for developing technical expertise within broad product markets, recruiting sales partners, creating demand, negotiating pricing and reviewing overall product and service requirements of our sales partners. Our sales representatives receive comprehensive training with respect to the technical characteristics of suppliers’ products, supplemented by frequent product and service seminars conducted by vendor representatives and bi-weekly meetings among product, marketing and sales managers.
Our sales teams also provide sales partners with online ordering, API, EDI and other information systems, allowing sale partners to easily gain access to product specifications, availability, and customized pricing, as well as the ability to place and follow the status of orders. 
Marketing
We market our technology solutions and services through a range of digital and print channels, including online product catalogs customized for our North American, Brazilian, other Latin American and European markets; social media; search engine optimization and marketing; content marketing; content automation; e-commerce; email direct marketing, among others. Our marketing practices are tailored to fit the specific needs of our sales partners and suppliers - ensuring we help our partners create, deliver and manage solutions for end-customers across our vertical markets. Our comprehensive marketing efforts include sales promotions, advertisements, management of sales leads, trade show design and event management, advertorials, content creation, partner events, and training and certification courses with leading suppliers in an effort to recruit prospective sales partners. 
Operations
Information Technology Systems
Starting in 2015, we rolled-out a new, global SAP information system designed to replace the current existing systems. This new system is currently operating in the U.S. and Canada, excluding Intelisys, POS Portal and RPM; in Europe, excluding intY; and Latin America, excluding Brazil. Our information systems are scalable and capable of supporting numerous operational functions including purchasing, receiving, order processing, shipping, inventory management and accounting. Our sales partners and employees rely on our information systems for on-line, real-time information on pricing, inventory availability and reservation and order status. Our warehouse operations use bar code technology for receiving and shipping and automated systems for freight processing and shipment tracking, each of which is integrated with our multiple information systems. The customer service and technical support departments employ systems for documentation and faster processing of sales partner inquiries. To ensure that adequate inventory levels are maintained, our buyers depend on the system’s purchasing and receiving functions to track inventory on a perpetual basis. 
Warehouse and Shipping Strategy
We operate a 741,000 square foot distribution center in Southaven, Mississippi, which is located near the FedEx hub facility in Memphis, Tennessee, and serves primarily all of North America. We also acquired warehouses in California and Kentucky through our POS Portal acquisition. Our European operations utilize a limited number of distribution centers located in Belgium, France and the United Kingdom. Warehouses for our Brazil and other Latin American operations are located in Florida, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Chile. Our objective is to ship all orders on the same day, using technology to expedite shipments and minimize shipping errors. We offer reduced freight rates and flexible delivery options to minimize a sales partner’s need for inventory.
Index to Financial Statements

Financial Services
Our sales terms compete within our specific geographic areas to facilitate various third-party financing options, which include leasing, flooring and other secured financing for qualified sales partners. We believe this policy reduces the sales partner’s need to establish multiple credit relationships.
Trade and Service Marks
We conduct our business under the trade names "ScanSource POS and Barcode," "ScanSource Catalyst," "ScanSource Communications," "ScanSource Services," "ScanSource Networking and Security," "ScanSource KBZ," "ScanSource Europe," "ScanSource Europe Communications," "ScanSource Latin America," "ScanSource de Mexico," "ScanSource Brasil," "ScanSource Imago," "Network1, a ScanSource company," "Intelisys," "POS Portal," "Canpango," "RPM Software, a ScanSource company" and "intY, a ScanSource company." 
Certain of our tradenames, trademarks and service marks are registered, or are in the process of being registered, in the United States or various other countries. We have been issued registrations for many of our marks including, among others, "ScanSource," "Catalyst Telecom," and "Network1" in countries in our principal markets. Even though our marks are not registered in every country where we conduct business, in many cases we have acquired rights in those marks because of our continued use of them. These marks do not have value assigned to them and have a designated indefinite life. We do not believe that our operations are dependent upon any of our marks. We also sell products and provide services under various third-party tradenames, trademarks and service marks, some of which we reference in this report, and these tradenames, trademarks, and service marks are the property of their respective owners.
