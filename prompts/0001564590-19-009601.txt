ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in novel therapeutics to treat chronic, high-prevalence retinal diseases. Our most advanced product candidate is KSI-301, a biologic therapy built with our antibody biopolymer conjugate platform, or ABC Platform, which is designed to maintain potent and effective drug levels in ocular tissues. We believe that KSI-301, if approved, has the potential to become an important anti-VEGF therapy in retinal vascular diseases including wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, and diabetic retinopathy, or DR. KSI-301 and our ABC Platform were developed at Kodiak, and we own worldwide rights to those assets, including composition of matter patent protection for KSI-301. We have applied our ABC Platform to develop additional product candidates beyond KSI-301, including KSI-501, our bispecific anti-IL-6/VEGF bioconjugate. We intend to progress these and other product candidates to address high-prevalence ophthalmic diseases. We believe that the science underlying KSI-301's design and Kodiak's ABC Platform, in particular with regards to ocular durability, ocular target tissue penetration, high molar dose and stability constitute differentiating attributes that we believe will be important for a truly next-generation retinal disease therapy.
 We initiated our first-in-human, single ascending dose Phase 1a clinical study of KSI-301 in the United States in nine patients with severe diabetic macular edema, or DME, in July 2018. In this study, patients were administered a single dose of KSI-301 and followed for 12 weeks, with the primary safety endpoint measured at 2 weeks. We successfully dosed all patients at the pre-planned dose levels and the final 12-week last visit took place in November 2018. The twelve-week data demonstrated safety and durability of responses following the single dose of KSI-301. Notably:
  
• | Rapid high-magnitude and durable treatment responses were seen at all dose levels tested in a heavily pre-treated Phase 1 patient population.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Twelve weeks after a single dose, median vision improvement from baseline of almost two lines of vision (9 eye chart letters) and median improvement in retinal edema of 121 microns were achieved (pooled across all three dose levels tested).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No dose-limiting toxicities, drug-related adverse events, or intraocular inflammation were observed through each patient’s last visit at 12 weeks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 After a single dose, eight of nine patients responded to KSI-301, as assessed by improvement from baseline in vision, anatomy, or both. Rapid improvements were observed as early as one week after the injection. The treatment effect increased through four weeks resulting in a median Best Corrected Visual Acuity, or BCVA, improvement of 12.5 eye chart letters and median Central Retinal Thickness on optical coherence tomography, or OCT, improvement of 120 microns, pooled across all three dose levels.
 Among the responders to KSI-301, all had sustained improvements from baseline (vision, retinal anatomy, or both) at the twelve-week last visit. At twelve weeks after the single dose, a median BCVA improvement of nine eye chart letters (almost two lines of vision) and median OCT improvement of 121 microns were observed, pooled across all three dose levels. The single non-responder subject had previously failed to respond to a regimen of Lucentis and EYLEA treatments.
 Through the 12-week last visit, single doses of KSI-301 demonstrated no dose-limiting toxicities, no drug-related adverse events, and no signs of intraocular inflammation. The highest dose tested, 5 mg, has been selected for advancement into pivotal studies.
 We believe the depth and durability of treatment responses seen in the Phase 1 single-dose study are very encouraging. This study of KSI-301 was designed as a first-in-human, single-dose safety study but also demonstrated bioactivity and 12-week durability. DME can be a challenging retinal disease to treat due to high intraocular VEGF levels and concurrent retinal vascular inflammation. For example, the approved dosing regimen for EYLEA in DME commences with five monthly loading doses. In our Phase 1a study, we observed treatment responses after only a single dose.
 We believe KSI-301 has the potential to be a highly differentiated therapy that can address the heavy treatment burden and suboptimal real-world outcomes of current medicines. We are fully committed to the continued rapid clinical development of KSI-301 and intend to evaluate its potential broadly in the treatment of patients with retinal vascular diseases.

We are currently enrolling a Phase 1b open-label multiple-dose study of KSI-301 at multiple clinical trial sites in the United States.  The Phase 1b is in treatment naïve patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (approximately 20 patients), DME (approximately 20 patients), and macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion (approximately 10 patients). The trial is designed such that all patients receive three loading doses once a month, and then are followed monthly, with further KSI-301 treatment determined by disease-specific retreatment criteria. All patients are planned to be evaluated through 36-weeks. Given the results of the Phase 1a study, we intend to evaluate this study for bioactivity and durability signals and look for this study to continue to build our knowledge of KSI-301 as an important new therapeutic candidate. We plan to present on-going Phase 1b data at key medical and investor conferences in 2019 and 2020.
 The Phase 1a data in DME patients supports our plan to study the potential durability advantage of KSI-301 over other anti-VEGF biologics in wet AMD, because AMD is a more localized retinal disease with typically lower levels of VEGF compared to DME. For this reason, we have enhanced our wet AMD pivotal Phase 2 study design to include evaluation of our top dose of 5mg at 20-week along with 16-week and 12-week dosing intervals in comparison to EYLEA on its 8-week labeled regimen. We believe that, if successful, a regimen which provides nearly all patients with a 12-week or better treatment interval would be unique and a potentially differentiating characteristic. We anticipate that this study will begin enrollment in the second quarter of 2019.  
 Furthermore, the bioactivity and durability profile of the treatment responses seen so far, as well as the observed safety profile, support the evaluation of KSI-301 in earlier forms of diabetic eye disease such as non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or NPDR. We believe that identifying and treating the right NPDR patients (those at higher risk of vision-threatening complications) with an infrequent dose regimen before vision loss occurs could have a tremendous public health impact.
 We expect to be dosing patients in our global Phase 2 study of KSI-301 in the United States in the second quarter of 2019. This randomized, controlled study in approximately 400 treatment naïve wet AMD patients will evaluate the non-inferiority of intravitreal KSI-301 administered as infrequently as every 20 weeks versus EYLEA (aflibercept) administered on its every 8-week labeled regimen. 
 We additionally plan to initiate two Phase 2 studies in China, one in wet AMD and one in DME, and we are planning for these studies to have the same clinical design frameworks as our U.S. and European Union studies. We have submitted a pre-IND package to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation, or CDE, and hope to submit an IND, or Investigational New Drug application, in China later this year with an objective to begin enrollment in 2019.
 We continue to evaluate the timing and design of the planned global Phase 2 study in DME patients and also our clinical strategy in NPDR patients. At this time, we plan to initiate the global Phase 2 study in DME in the second half of 2019, but we may elect to shift out this study start depending on the tempo of our China Phase 2 study starts as well as our evolving NPDR strategy.
 As reported earlier and following from potential learnings in our Phase 1b study, in the future, we may also pursue other target indications for KSI-301 such as macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion, choroidal neovascularization due to pathologic myopia, or other diseases for which existing anti-VEGF therapies have been approved or may be beneficial. 
 Target Indications 
 Our initial target indications for KSI-301 are wet AMD and diabetic eye disease. Wet AMD is a chronic and progressive disease of the central portion of the retina, known as the macula, which is responsible for sharp central vision and color perception. It is caused by abnormal blood vessels that grow underneath the retina and leak blood and fluid into the macula, causing visual distortion and acute vision loss, which can be permanent. Wet AMD is the leading cause of severe vision loss in adults over the age of 50 in the United States and the European Union, or EU. We estimate the combined prevalence of wet AMD in the United States and the EU to be approximately 2.9 million people. Diabetic eye disease results from diabetes, in which chronically elevated blood sugar levels and other metabolic abnormalities cause progressive damage to blood vessels in the retina. Diabetic eye disease is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults in the United States and the EU. We estimate that the number of people in the United States and the EU with diabetic eye disease in 2015 was approximately 28.5 million.

Ongoing and Planned Clinical Development 
 The following chart summarizes our clinical development plan for our lead product candidate, KSI-301: 
 

For approval in the U.S. and the EU, we anticipate that one additional study would be required for each of wet AMD and DME and expect that the design framework for these studies would be similar to the planned Phase 2 studies. 
 Additional product candidates are in preclinical development. As reported earlier, a final lead candidate has been selected for KSI-501, a bispecific anti-IL-6/anti-VEGF antibody biopolymer conjugate being developed for diabetic eye disease and uveitis. Cell-line construction for CHO mammalian manufacturing is in progress, and we expect the cGMP cell bank to be completed this year. We are deprioritizing our KSI-401 product candidate for dry AMD, as it targets only a single biology and are instead interested to apply bispecific and/or other multi-biology inhibitors to address this multifactorial disease.
 Current Standard of Care for Wet AMD and DR 
 Overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, in ocular tissues is central to the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of wet AMD and DR. VEGF is a protein produced by cells that stimulates the formation of new blood vessels, a process called neovascularization, and induces vascular permeability. In wet AMD and DR, fluid that exits from blood vessels causes swelling, or edema, of the retina and loss of vision. This loss of vision can be reversed if treated early with an anti-VEGF agent to suppress VEGF signaling. Delayed treatment or undertreatment can result in permanent retinal damage and blindness. To reach effective ocular tissue concentrations, these agents must be injected into the vitreous humor, the jelly-like substance that fills the area between the lens and retina. These injections must occur at regular intervals in order to maintain anti-VEGF effects.

Lucentis (ranibizumab), marketed by Genentech, Inc., a subsidiary of the Roche Group, in the United States and by Novartis AG outside the United States, and EYLEA (aflibercept), marketed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the United States and by Bayer HealthCare LLC outside the United States, are anti-VEGF therapies that have become the standard of care for treating wet AMD and severe forms of DR based on pivotal clinical studies in which Lucentis was injected every four weeks and EYLEA was injected every eight weeks (after three initial monthly doses in the case of wet AMD and after five initial monthly doses in the case of DR with DME). Avastin (bevacizumab), marketed for non-ocular indications by Genentech in the United States and by Roche outside of the United States, is an anti-VEGF cancer therapy that shares structural characteristics with Lucentis and is commonly used off-label to treat wet AMD and DR through intravitreal injection dosed every four weeks. 
 Annual worldwide sales of Lucentis and EYLEA for all indications totaled approximately $10.5 billion in 2018. We believe that a substantial majority of these sales were in connection with the treatment of wet AMD and DR. Avastin, which is currently approved and marketed for the treatment of cancer, is also used off-label to treat wet AMD and DR. We estimate that off-label Avastin represents approximately 60% of the U.S. wet AMD market by volume. We believe that an improved anti-VEGF therapy could further increase both adoption of approved therapies and extend the duration patients remain on treatment, and thus the total addressable market opportunity in wet AMD and DR could be substantial. 
 Limitations of Current Anti-VEGF Therapies 
 The limitations of current anti-VEGF therapies include: 
  
• | Existing anti-VEGF therapies block VEGF activity effectively but have limited durability. We believe current anti-VEGF therapies maintain potent and effective drug levels in ocular tissues for three to six weeks after injection on average. But typical treatment intervals in real-world clinical practice are longer. When a patient’s dosing cycle is extended beyond the durability of the anti-VEGF agent, and the amount of drug remaining in the eye falls below therapeutic levels, the disease can progress and cause cumulative and permanent retinal damage. Most wet AMD and DR patients will require protracted anti-VEGF therapy, possibly for life. Under these circumstances, strict adherence to the manufacturer’s labeled treatment regimen of every four weeks for Lucentis and every eight weeks for EYLEA is challenging.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Real-world utilization of current anti-VEGFs results in undertreatment, which diminishes effectiveness. A divergence between the efficacy of Lucentis and EYLEA in pivotal clinical trials and in the real world is evidenced in multiple studies and is increasingly recognized as an important unmet medical need. A 2017 report by the Angiogenesis Foundation suggested that the burden involved in monthly visits for evaluation and treatment causes patients and physicians to extend treatment intervals, which in turn results in undertreatment and visual outcomes that fall short of the results seen in clinical trials. For example, Lucentis was tested and failed to successfully extend the treatment interval to 12-week dosing, with patients going back to pre-treatment baseline or even losing vision at the end of the first year of treatment, on average. The Lucentis U.S. product labeling refers to this regimen as an option which is “not as effective” as monthly dosing. Recently, the FDA allowed an update to EYLEA’s labeling to allow 12-week dosing, but only in the second year of treatment (after one full year of intensive treatment). The labeling refers to it as “not as effective as the recommended every 8-week dosing.” Even a small deviation from per label dosing can be devastating for vision. Missing as few as one or two injections in a year from EYLEA’s recommended dosing, results in almost one line of vision lost.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patients are not sustaining visual acuity gains over the long term. Following exit from tightly controlled clinical trials into the real-world environment, patients, on average, lose all the gains in visual acuity that had been previously achieved.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Damage caused by these retinal diseases may be irreversible if anti-VEGF therapy is not initiated early in the disease progression. A study in patients with diabetic macular edema, or DME, a severe form of DR, found that undertreatment in the early course of patients’ disease may reduce the patients’ ability to respond to anti-VEGF therapies.

KSI-301: Our Lead Product Candidate 
 Our lead product candidate, KSI-301, is a novel, clinical-stage anti-VEGF biological agent that combines inhibition of a known pathway with a potentially superior ocular durability profile compared to currently marketed drugs for wet AMD and DR.

KSI-301 is a bioconjugate comprised of two components. The first component is a humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody which binds to human VEGF. The antibody component is designed to be pharmacologically similar to Lucentis. The second component of KSI-301 is an optically clear phosphorylcholine-based biopolymer which is stably attached to the antibody and which is intended to augment the stability and residence time of the bioconjugate in the eye without compromising its anti-VEGF activity. 
 

We believe that KSI-301 can be a highly differentiated treatment with an improved durability profile compared to current anti-VEGF therapies because of its design features and the associated performance benefits we have observed with KSI-301 in pre-clinical studies. These design features include (1) an ultrahigh molecular weight of 950 kDa versus 48 kDa (Lucentis) and 115 kDa (EYLEA) to increase intraocular durability, (2) a phosphorylcholine-based antibody biopolymer conjugate to increase ocular tissue bioavailability while preserving bioactivity, along with increased stability, and (3) an increased formulation strength to deliver higher molar doses of anti-VEGF (7x versus Lucentis and 3.5x versus EYLEA). We believe these qualities of KSI-301 have the potential to translate into clinically meaningful advantages over currently available therapies. KSI-301 was designed to optimize both size and formulation strength to improve durability:
 

As a result, we believe that KSI-301 has the potential to (1) keep patients on mechanism for longer than currently available anti-VEGF therapies, thereby preventing repeated undertreatment through overextension of treatment intervals, (2) match the required frequency of injections to keep the patient’s disease quiescent with the frequency of visits that patient and physician behavior suggest is achievable in clinical practice and (3) sustain the strong visual acuity gains of the early intensive treatment phase over the long term and outside of clinical trial contexts. By addressing the primary causes of undertreatment, KSI-301 has the potential to improve and sustain visual acuity outcomes in patients with neovascular conditions of the retina such as wet AMD and DR.

Clinical Development 
 KSI-301 Phase 1 Clinical Study 
 We submitted our IND to the FDA in June 2018 for the use of KSI-301 in patients with retinal vascular diseases (including wet AMD and DR). We initiated our first-in-human, Phase 1, single ascending dose clinical study of KSI-301 in the United States in nine patients with center-involved diabetic macular edema in July 2018. Objectives of this study included assessment of ocular and systemic safety, tolerability, and establishment of a maximum tolerated dose. Three dose levels of KSI-301 were evaluated: 1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg, with 3 patients per cohort. The study design can be summarized as follows:
 

The demographics and ocular baseline characteristics of the study population were as follows:
 
We successfully dosed all patients at the pre-planned dose levels and reached the primary safety and tolerability endpoint of the study, which occurred after each patient reached the 14-day follow up period following the single injection of KSI-301. The patients were subsequently followed through a 12-week safety follow-up period. Single doses of KSI-301 demonstrated no dose-limiting toxicities, no drug-related adverse events, and no signs of intraocular inflammation. The highest dose tested, 5 mg, has been selected for advancement into pivotal studies.
 6

The treatment effect increased through four weeks resulting in a median BCVA improvement of 12.5 eye chart letters and median Central Retinal Thickness on OCT improvement of 120 microns, pooled across all three dose levels. At twelve weeks after the single dose, a median BCVA improvement of nine eye chart letters (almost two lines of vision) and median OCT improvement of 121 microns were observed, pooled across all three dose levels. Improvements in vision and retinal thickness after a single-dose of KSI-301 through 12 weeks were as follows:
 

To help contextualize our results, the figure below shows example color retinal photographs and OCT images from both normal patients and a patient with DME who did not participate in our study. The extent of pathology seen in patients with DME is readily visible when comparing to the normal photograph. 
 
7

The below figure demonstrates examples of the varying severity of DME visible on OCT imaging, again from patients with DME who did not participate in our study. In contrast to the normal OCT image, the OCT images from DME patients can demonstrate disease-related changes including intraretinal cysts, intraretinal edema, intraretinal lipid deposits, and subretinal fluid. 
 
8

Finally, the below images demonstrate an example image from a fluorescein angiogram, or FA, another imaging tool used to assess retinal disease. These are also from patients who did not participate in our study. Visible in the images from DME patients are varying degrees of ischemia, vascular leakage, and neovascularization. 
 
KSI-301 On-going Phase 1b Clinical Study 
 We have expanded the scope of our Phase 1 single-dose study into a Phase 1b multiple-dose study, to evaluate the treatment effect and safety of sequential doses of KSI-301. The Phase 1b is in treatment naïve patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (approximately 20 patients), DME (approximately 20 patients), and macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion (RVO; approximately 10 patients), another important but less-common retinal vascular disease for which both EYLEA and Lucentis are FDA-approved. In the Phase 1b study, we are conducting intensive ophthalmic imaging and ocular pharmacokinetic assessments over the 36-week treatment duration to define the profile of KSI-301 in the context of existing and emerging data in the field. All patients receive three loading doses once a month, and then are followed monthly, with further KSI-301 treatment determined by disease-specific retreatment criteria. All patients are planned to be evaluated through 36-weeks. Given the results of the Phase 1a study, we will study the bioactivity and durability signals that emerge in Phase 1b and expect this study to continue to build our knowledge of KSI-301 as a new therapeutic candidate. Recruitment for this study is currently ongoing and we plan to present on-going Phase 1b data at key medical and investor conferences in 2019 and 2020
KSI-301 Planned Phase 2 Clinical Studies 
 Having successfully reached the 12-week last visit in the Phase 1 study and having initiated dosing in our Phase 1b clinical study, with the additional observations around bioactivity, we plan to further evaluate the highest dose tested of KSI-301, 5 mg, in a series of global studies in wet AMD, DME, and DR. 
 We expect to be enrolling patients in a global Phase 2 study of KSI-301 in the United States in the second quarter of 2019. This randomized, controlled study in approximately 400 treatment naïve wet AMD patients will evaluate the non-inferiority of intravitreal KSI-301 administered as infrequently as every 20 weeks versus EYLEA (aflibercept) administered on its every 8-week labeled regimen (after three loading doses). FDA has indicated that a Phase 2 study with this type of design, if successful, can be supportive of a marketing application for KSI-301 as one of two pivotal studies in wet AMD required for approval in the United States. 
 9

We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 randomized controlled clinical study of KSI-301 in DME patients in the U.S. and E.U. We also expect this study to evaluate the non-inferiority of KSI-301 administered on an every 12 week or less frequent dosing schedule versus EYLEA administered on its every 8-week (labeled) regimen (after five loading doses). We plan to initiate dosing in this study by the end of 2019 or early 2020. 
 We additionally plan to initiate two Phase 2 studies in China, one in wet AMD and one in DME, and we are planning for these studies to have the same clinical design frameworks as our U.S./EU studies. We filed the regulatory pre-IND package to China’s Center for Drug Evaluation in January 2019, and we hope to file the IND in China in the first half of 2019 and initiate dosing in the second half of 2019. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases. The key elements of our strategy are: 

• | Complete clinical development of KSI-301 for wet AMD and DR. We are devoting a significant portion of our resources and business efforts to the manufacture and clinical development of KSI-301 for retinal vascular diseases. We anticipate initiating a Phase 2 wet AMD study of KSI-301 in the U.S. and EU in the second quarter of 2019 to evaluate the non-inferiority of intravitreal KSI-301 administered as infrequently as every 20-weeks versus EYLEA. The FDA has indicated this study, KSI-CL-102, if successful, can be supportive of a marketing application for KSI-301. We are thus designing and intend to execute this Phase 2 study as a pivotal study. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of KSI-301 in the U.S. and EU in DME patients and are formulating our strategy for evaluating KSI-301 in earlier Diabetic Retinopathy, or DR. We also plan to initiate two Phase 2 studies in China, one in wet AMD and one in DME, and we are planning for these studies to have the same clinical design frameworks as our U.S. and EU studies. We plan to perform an administrative interim analysis of our Phase 2 data after approximately 200 patients (100 on KSI-301 and 100 on EYLEA) have been treated for approximately 6 months, to evaluate the KSI-301 Q20W (once every 20 weeks), Q16W (once every 16 weeks), and Q12W (once every 12 weeks) durability proportion. We expect to undertake this administrative interim analysis in either or both of the global or China Phase 2 studies. We may use the results of this interim analysis to inform future activities related to KSI-301. In parallel to our Phase 2 programs, we have expanded the scope of our Phase 1 study into a Phase 1b open label design to evaluate the safety and treatment effect of sequential doses of KSI-301 in approximately 50 patients with retinal vascular disease including wet AMD, DME, and RVO.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish market acceptance of KSI-301 in wet AMD and diabetic eye disease. We believe that if KSI-301 is approved and is shown to have comparable efficacy and improved durability to other anti-VEGF therapies, it will compete favorably with other marketed products for retinal vascular disease. In addition, we believe KSI-301 may potentially expand the market reach to patients not currently on approved standard of care therapies or not currently on therapy at all.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seek to expand the use of KSI-301 in DR beyond DME. We intend to explore the use of KSI-301 in the treatment of all subtypes of DR patients. Currently marketed anti-VEGFs are used primarily to treat late and advanced manifestations of DR, particularly DME. We believe that the potential for improved durability of KSI-301 could not only improve the standard of care but also expand the patient population that receives anti-VEGF therapy to include patients with less severe forms of DR for whom frequent injections may be a barrier to adoption.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercialize KSI-301 with our own specialty sales force. KSI-301 is wholly-owned by us. If KSI-301 receives marketing approval, we plan to commercialize it in the United States with our own focused, specialty sales force. We believe that retinal specialists in the United States, who perform most of the medical procedures involving retinal diseases, are sufficiently concentrated that we will be able to effectively promote KSI-301 with a sales and marketing group of fewer than 200 people. We expect to explore collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize KSI-301 in markets outside the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance the development of our other ABC product candidates. We intend to continue deploying capital to selectively develop our own portfolio of product candidates based on our ABC Platform (including bispecific inhibitors such as KSI-501). We may partner with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to further develop our ABC Platform and product candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Discover and develop future product candidates for areas of unmet need. We intend to continue our discovery efforts and deepen our pipeline of medicines for high-prevalence ophthalmic diseases. We may opportunistically in-license or acquire the rights to complementary products, other product candidates and technologies to aid in the treatment of a range of ophthalmic diseases, principally diseases of the retina.

Market Opportunity 
 Wet AMD 
 Overview of Wet AMD 
 AMD is a common eye condition affecting people of age 55 years and older with a reported prevalence of approximately 11 million people in the United States and 170 million people globally. It is a progressive disease affecting the central portion of the retina, known as the macula, which is the region of the eye responsible for sharp, central vision and color perception. The likelihood of AMD progression and associated vision loss increases with age. 
 Wet AMD is an advanced form of AMD characterized by neovascularization and fluid leakage under the retina. It is the leading cause of severe vision loss in patients over the age of 50 in the United States and the EU, with a reported prevalence of approximately 1.25 million people and an annual incidence of approximately 200,000 people in the United States. The likelihood of disease progression increases with age, so the prevalence and incidence of wet AMD is projected to accelerate in countries with aging populations. It has additionally been observed that approximately 50% of patients presenting with wet AMD in one eye will develop wet AMD in the other eye within five years, leading to a relatively significant number of patients requiring treatment in both eyes. While wet AMD represents only 10% of the number of cases of AMD overall, it is responsible for 90% of AMD-related severe vision loss. In many eyes with wet AMD, the disease can progress quickly with rapid loss of central vision needed for activities such as reading and driving. Untreated or undertreated wet AMD results in blood vessel leakage, fluid in the macula, and ultimately scar tissue formation, which can lead to permanent vision loss, or even blindness, as a result of the scarring and retinal deformation that occur during periods of non-treatment or undertreatment. 
 Current Therapies for Wet AMD 
 The standard of care treatments for wet AMD are two anti-VEGF drugs, Lucentis (ranibizumab) and EYLEA (aflibercept). Lucentis (ranibizumab), marketed by Genentech, Inc., a subsidiary of the Roche Group, in the United States and by Novartis AG outside the United States, is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds to and inhibits VEGF proteins in the eye and was approved in the United States in 2006 and in Europe in 2007. EYLEA (aflibercept), marketed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the United States and by Bayer HealthCare LLC outside the United States, is a recombinant fusion protein containing portions of the human VEGF receptor that binds to soluble VEGF and was approved in the United States in 2011 and in Europe in 2012. These drugs became the standard of care for treating wet AMD based on pivotal clinical trials in which Lucentis was injected every four weeks and EYLEA was injected every eight weeks (after three initial monthly loading doses). Since its approval, EYLEA has been widely adopted largely due to a durability advantage compared to Lucentis, but both agents were effective in improving visual acuity in the first months of the treatment period and sustaining this gain throughout the duration of their respective clinical trials. Avastin (bevacizumab), marketed for non-ocular indications by Genentech in the United States and by Roche outside of the United States, is an anti-VEGF cancer therapy that shares structural characteristics with Lucentis and is commonly used off-label as a monthly, intravitreal injection for wet AMD. 
 Total Market for Wet AMD 
 Annual worldwide sales of Lucentis and EYLEA for all indications totaled approximately $10.5 billion in 2018. We believe a substantial majority of these sales were in connection with the treatment of wet AMD and DR. Avastin, which is currently approved and marketed for the treatment of cancer, is also used off-label to treat wet AMD and DR. We estimate that off-label Avastin represents approximately 60% of the U.S. wet AMD market by volume. We believe that an improved anti-VEGF therapy could further increase both adoption of approved therapies and extend the duration patients remain on treatment, and thus the total addressable market opportunity in wet AMD and DR could be substantial. 
 With an improved anti-VEGF therapy, we believe the total addressable market opportunity in wet AMD could be substantially greater than sales of Lucentis and EYLEA in wet AMD and DR. A clinically meaningful durability advantage over existing treatments could increase long-term compliance rates and maintain patients on a consistent and FDA approved treatment regimen for this chronic condition. Furthermore, we believe that an anti-VEGF therapy that is more durable than Avastin may reduce the relative weight of cost as a deciding factor for patients and providers who currently favor Avastin and expand the market for “branded” treatments.

Diabetic Retinopathy 
 Overview of Diabetic Retinopathy 
 DR is an eye disease resulting from diabetes, in which chronically elevated blood sugar levels cause damage to blood vessels in the retina. There are two major types of DR: 

• | Non-proliferative DR, or NPDR. NPDR is an earlier, more typical stage of DR and can progress into more severe forms of DR over time if untreated and if exposure to elevated blood sugar levels persists.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proliferative DR, or PDR. PDR is a more advanced stage of DR than NPDR. It is characterized by retinal neovascularization and, if left untreated, leads to permanent damage and blindness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DME, which occurs when fluid accumulates in the macula due to leaking blood vessels, can develop at any stage of DR. PDR, together with DME, are the primary causes of vision-threatening DR, or VTDR. VTDR is the leading cause of blindness among people with diabetes and the leading cause of blindness among working age adults in the United States and the EU. Patients with mild or moderate NPDR who have not developed DME are characterized as patients with non-vision threatening DR, or NVTDR. 
 Current Therapies for DR 
 PDR has historically been treated with laser therapy. In recent years, use of anti-VEGF therapies has emerged as a complementary first-line treatment for PDR. Lucentis and EYLEA are also approved for the treatment of DME with or without PDR. In April 2017, Lucentis’ approval was expanded to include all forms of DR, whether or not the patient also has DME. The approval was based on the demonstration that treatment with Lucentis results in more patients experiencing improvement of their diabetic retinopathy severity (disease regression). In March 2018, Regeneron announced results from its study in which EYLEA demonstrated it can reverse disease progression in patients with moderately severe to severe NPDR when administered on average 4.4 times over 24 weeks. An FDA decision on the potential approval of EYLEA for diabetic retinopathy is expected in May 2019.
 The first-line interventions for NVTDR are observation, lifestyle changes and treatment of underlying diabetes. In practice, anti-VEGF therapies are not commonly prescribed for patients with NVTDR. However, results from the RISE and RIDE trials for Lucentis showed that anti-VEGF therapies can slow disease progression in patients with NPDR as well as induce regression.

Total Market for DR 
 According to the Center for Disease Control, or CDC, and National Institutes of Health, or NIH, (1) an estimated 30 million people in the United States have diabetes, with approximately 1.5 million additional people in the United States diagnosed with diabetes each year, and (2) 285 million people worldwide have diabetes. We estimate that the number of people in the United States and the EU with DR in 2015 was approximately 28.5 million. According to the NIH, the number of Americans with DR is expected to nearly double from 2010 to 2050. The CDC estimates that approximately 900,000 Americans are affected by VTDR. We believe a substantial majority of the $10.5 billion in sales of Lucentis and EYLEA in 2018 were for the treatment of wet AMD and DR. Furthermore, we believe that the frequent injections required by current anti-VEGF therapies may dissuade patients with mild or asymptomatic forms of DR from accepting treatment. A more durable agent such as KSI-301 could be attractive for these untreated patients and extend the anti-VEGF market to include patients with NVTDR. 
 Limitations of Current Anti-VEGF Therapies 
 The underlying pathophysiology of both wet AMD and DR are responsive to anti-VEGF drugs. Both conditions suffer from the limitations of current anti-VEGF therapies such as limited on-mechanism durability and frequent dosing intervals. On-mechanism durability is a function of the time that therapeutic levels are sustained in the ocular tissues. Data suggest that the effectiveness of Lucentis and EYLEA in clinical practice is inferior to the results seen in well-controlled clinical studies, an observation attributed to insufficiently frequent dosing and resulting undertreatment even, in the case of EYLEA, with its labeled eight-week regimen. Other studies show that while patients may benefit from anti-VEGF therapies in the early treatment phase, they may fail to sustain their visual acuity gains over the long term. Clinical studies have also shown that non-treatment or undertreatment with anti-VEGF agents in the months or years after disease onset may reduce the benefit of anti-VEGF therapies once therapy is initiated. These factors contribute to permanent and unnecessary vision loss for many patients. 
 Existing anti-VEGF therapies block VEGF activity effectively but have limited durability. 
 Wet AMD and DR are chronic and progressive diseases that require protracted treatment, possibly for life. Currently available anti-VEGF agents have relatively short durability. To maintain effective drug levels in the eye, existing anti-VEGF treatments must be administered on a frequent and sustained schedule. Lucentis was approved based on a monthly dosing interval. EYLEA was approved based on a dosing interval of every eight weeks (following three initial, monthly loading doses). The most accepted sign of disease activity in wet AMD for retina specialists worldwide is recurrent accumulation of fluid in the macula, as determined by evaluating the retinal thickness and anatomic appearance with OCT. As can be seen in the figure below, when EYLEA or Lucentis are dosed on a Q4W (once every four weeks) regimen, the retinal thickness remains stable between doses, as measured on OCT. However, when EYLEA dosing is shifted to its Q8W (once every eight weeks) labeled regimen, the retina expands and contracts as it begins to swell with fluid before its next retreatment, exhibiting a seesaw pattern that we refer to as OCT flutter. This suggests that, although vision outcomes are comparable on average between fixed-interval 4-weekly and 8-weekly dosing, EYLEA’s durability and ability to maintain disease control as measured by OCT is less than the approved 8-week per-label dosing. 
 
Figure: Retinal thickness (y-axis), measured in nanometers, decreases upon treatment with EYLEA. Rq4 = Lucentis every four weeks; 0.5q4 = EYLEA 0.5mg every four weeks; 2q4 = EYLEA 2mg every four weeks; 2q8 = EYLEA 2mg every eight weeks. 
 The clinical implication is that when a patient’s dosing cycle is extended beyond the durability of the anti-VEGF agent and the amount of drug remaining in the eye falls below therapeutic levels, disease activity can recur. At this point, the disease can progress and begin to cause cumulative and possibly permanent retinal damage. To this point, the EYLEA product labeling in the United States notes that “some patients may need every 4-week (monthly) dosing after the first 12 weeks (3 months).” 
 13

Additional evidence of the recognition of limited durability is seen in the FDA’s evaluation of both Lucentis and EYLEA. Lucentis was tested for its potential to reach quarterly dosing in a Phase 3b study; it failed to successfully deliver the same efficacy results as monthly dosing. The FDA did accept dosing every three months after three initial monthly loading doses in the Lucentis product labeling, with the following wording: “Although not as effective, patients may be treated with 3 monthly doses followed by less frequent dosing with regular assessment. In the 9 months after three initial monthly doses, less frequent dosing with 4-5 doses on average is expected to maintain visual acuity while monthly dosing may be expected to result in an additional average 1-2 letter gain. Patients should be assessed regularly.” The loss of one line of vision translates into patients going back to baseline or even losing vision at the end of the first year of treatment, on average. Furthermore, the required wording of regular assessments means that the high burden of frequent office visits remains. For EYLEA, recently, the FDA updated the product labeling to allow 12-week dosing but only in the second year of treatment, after one full year of intensive treatment. The labeling refers to it as “not as effective as the recommended every 8-week dosing.” For both Lucentis and EYLEA, the recommended fixed interval dosing of monthly and bimonthly, respectively, appear to result in the best and most consistent visual acuity results, with all flexible or less-frequent dosing intervals labeled by FDA as “not as effective.” 
 Real-world utilization of current anti-VEGF therapies results in undertreatment which diminishes effectiveness. 
 Extended treatment intervals caused by the burden of frequent treatments causes undertreatment and visual outcomes that fall short of the results seen in pivotal clinical trials. 
 Compared to Lucentis’ pivotal trials in wet AMD, ANCHOR and MARINA, where initial vision gains are maintained with monthly dosing over two years, a variety of studies have shown that the initial gains (if achieved) are not maintained, on average, after the initial loading phase. 
 This is clearly seen in AURA, a multi-country real-world practice study of Lucentis. The visual acuity improvement seen in AURA falls significantly short of the visual acuity improvement that patients showed in MARINA and ANCHOR. A gradual loss of the initial vision gains can be seen as early as three months after initiation of treatment as depicted in the graph below. A key finding in AURA is that populations that received less frequent anti-VEGF treatment tended to experience less improvement in visual acuity, on average, as illustrated in the table below.

Consistent with the AURA study, an observational study following patients who completed the SEVEN UP and HORIZON trials for Lucentis in wet AMD showed a correlation between the number of injections and level of visual acuity benefit. Patients who received 11 or more injections during the period from four to eight years after they exited the pivotal clinical trial were more likely to experience improved vision (average gain of 3.9 letters) than patients who received six to ten injections during the same period (average loss of 6.9 letters).

 Table: Mean letter change from HORIZON to SEVEN UP by total number of anti-VEGF treatments. 
 The implication of these data is that in clinical practice and outside of clinical studies, patients are receiving fewer injections than the labeled regimens for Lucentis (12 per year) and EYLEA (seven to eight in the first year and six in subsequent years). In 2017, the Angiogenesis Foundation reported that in routine clinical practice, 65% of wet AMD patients receive six or fewer injections during the first year of treatment. Likewise, a recent publication from the American Academy of Ophthalmology’s IRIS (Intelligent Research In Sight) patient registry showed that, in 13,859 U.S. patients with wet AMD, the average number of injections in the first year of treatment was approximately six. 
 As illustrated in the top right of the figure below, data regarding long-term anti-VEGF treatment show that visual acuity outcomes are positively correlated with number of injections, with the greatest benefit seen when therapies are used at 10.5 or more injections per year reflecting high intensity, fixed Q4W or Q8W dosing. 
 
Figure: Five-year visual acuity outcomes versus injection frequency for three or more years in AMD.

In real-world practice, even a small deviation from per-labeled dosing can result in significant vision loss. In the PERSEUS Study, the real-world effectiveness of EYLEA was evaluated in patients treated per-label (regular treatment) compared to patients treated irregularly. Patients treated regularly received a mean of 7.4 injections compared to 5.2 in the irregular treatment group. The initial vision gains seen after the loading doses started to decrease at month four, with vision returning, on average, to almost baseline in the irregularly treated patients, as shown in the graph below. The difference in vision of 4.6 letters gained between the two groups is statistically significant, and, more importantly represents almost a line (five eye chart letters) of vision difference on average, which is recognized in the field as clinically meaningful. Additionally, in this study, the majority of patients (70.5%) did not receive regular treatment. 
 
Figure: mean change in visual acuity for regularly and irregularly treated patients in the PERSEUS Study (effectiveness set) 
 Real-world outcomes of anti-VEGF treatment in patients with DME show similar patterns to wet AMD. For instance, a recently published report of electronic health records real-world data from 15,608 DME patient eyes showed that patients on average receive fewer injections over 12 months and have meaningfully worse visual acuity outcomes compared to randomized controlled trials. 
 Patients are not sustaining visual acuity gains over the long term. 
 Patients treated with anti-VEGF agents can sustain visual acuity gains over time if they adhere to a tighter dose frequency. Results from the VIEW 1 extension study demonstrate that it is possible for patients treated with anti-VEGF agents to sustain visual acuity gains over time, as long as patients adhere to a tighter dose frequency that is closer to the labeled regimen. In the early intensive treatment phase, patients in VIEW 1 achieved a ten-letter visual acuity gain, which they then maintained over two years on a Q8W regimen. At the end of two years, patients shifted into a less-intensive clinical monitoring regimen and into a more flexible dosing regimen in which they were required to maintain at least Q12W dosing. In this hybrid setting, patients showed a slow but steady decrease in average visual acuity from ten letters to seven letters; however, their average visual acuity did not drop to pretreatment levels or below.

 Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials Follow-up Study: (A) overall and by drug assigned in the clinical 
 trial and (B) overall and by dosing regimen assigned in the clinical trial. PRN = “as needed.”

As mentioned above, AURA and many other real-world practice studies show that the vision gains seen in tightly controlled clinical trials are not transferrable to clinical practice. A United Kingdom study of approximately 93,000 Lucentis injections reviewed EMRs of thousands of patients treated outside the context of clinical trials. On average, patients received a median of 5, 4, and 4 injections of Lucentis over years one, two and three, respectively. The study found that although patients showed early improvement, they regressed, on average, to pretreatment levels by the end of year two with continued deterioration below their starting visual acuity by year three, as shown in the chart below. 
 
Figure: Mean visual acuity (VA), as measured by letter score, over time comparing patients with follow-up of at least 1, 2 or 3 years. 
 More importantly, with many patients losing vision, during the study follow-up many patients experienced new sight impairment (29.6%, 41%, 48.7% and 53.7% in years one, two, three and four, respectively) and even new cases of blindness (5.1%, 8.6%, 12% and 15.6% in years one through four, respectively). 
 In the United States, an EMR study of 7,650 eyes treated with Lucentis and EYLEA outside of the clinical trial setting showed that these therapies improved patients’ visual acuity less in practice than they do in clinical trials. Further, by the end of the first year of treatment, patients’ average visual acuity had deteriorated below their pretreatment levels. 
 
Figure: Mean change in visual acuity (VA) letter score at 3, 6 and 12 months in the first year of treatment. 
 VA was lower at 12 months than at the beginning of treatment. 
 17

When patients leave the tightly controlled clinical trial environment, their eyesight, on average, falls to pretreatment levels. In practice, anti-VEGF therapies are not delivering the level of benefit that their pivotal clinical trials suggested. In the pivotal Lucentis trials MARINA and ANCHOR, patients were able to gain and maintain vision gains with monthly dosing over two years. After exiting the clinical trials, patients were followed in the HORIZON study with as needed dosing (Pro Re Nata or PRN) for three more years. Gradual vision decline can be seen immediately after exiting the trials, returning to pre-treatment baseline vision before the end of the third year of follow-up in HORIZON. 
 
Figure: Mean change in visual acuity (VA) letter score in MARINA and ANCHOR 
 (years one and two) and in HORIZON (years three to five). 
 VA gradually decreased immediately after the patients exited monthly dosing in a clinical trial setting. 
 A study funded by the National Eye Institute followed patients who left the tightly controlled clinical trial environment into clinical practice and showed that these patients, on average, lost all the gains in visual acuity that they obtained while enrolled in the trial. 
 
18

Undertreatment in the early course of patients’ disease risks the patients’ ability to benefit from anti-VEGF therapies after the passage of time. 
 After disease onset, how soon patients receive appropriate treatment is important to whether they can respond to treatment. Failure to appropriately treat neovascularization in the early period may reduce patients’ ability to respond to anti-VEGF therapies as the disease progresses, possibly leading to irreversible damage. In the RIDE/RISE clinical studies of Lucentis in DR, patients who received Lucentis saw an increase in visual acuity of 10 to 12 letters at month 24. Patients who received sham treatment (a procedure that is intended to mimic a therapy in a clinical trial as closely as possible without having any actual efficacy) for 24 months saw no benefit. At the 24-month mark, the patient arms were crossed over, such that the patients who had initially received sham treatment now began to receive Lucentis. These patients were only able to improve by four letters by year three. The interpretation is that the unchecked disease progression in the initial period damaged the retina to such an extent that patients were subsequently unable to respond to Lucentis to the same degree as patients treated with Lucentis earlier in their disease process. 
 
Figure: At 36 months, patients who received Lucentis 0.5mg experienced a mean BCVA change from 
 baseline of 11.4 letters and 11.0 letters in RIDE and RISE, respectively. Patients who received sham treatment for 
 24 months and then crossed over to Lucentis 0.5mg experienced a diminished benefit in mean best corrected visual 
 acuity change from baseline at 36 months of 4.7 letters and 4.3 letters in RIDE and RISE, respectively. 
 Conclusions 
 There is a significant and urgent unmet medical need to find better therapeutic options for patients with neovascular diseases of the retina that can: 
  
• | keep patients on mechanism for longer than currently available anti-VEGF therapies, thereby preventing repeated undertreatment by overextending treatment intervals and thus avoiding latent recurrence of retinal edema;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | match the required frequency of injections to keep the patient’s disease quiescent with the frequency of visits that patient and physician behavior suggest is achievable in practice;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sustain the strong visual acuity gains of the early intensive treatment phase over the long term and outside of clinical trial contexts; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide a tolerable treatment regimen even for patients who are early in the course of their disease, so they can achieve the maximal benefit of anti-VEGF therapy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the 2018 Preferences and Trends Survey conducted by the American Society of Retina Specialists, retina specialists worldwide cited both reduced treatment burden and long-acting durability as the greatest unmet needs regarding wet AMD treatment. 
 Our Lead Product Candidate: KSI-301 
 Our lead product candidate, KSI-301, is a novel, clinical-stage anti-VEGF biological agent that combines inhibition of a known pathway with a potentially superior on-mechanism durability profile compared to currently marketed drugs for wet AMD and DR. By addressing the primary causes of undertreatment, KSI-301 has the potential to improve and sustain visual acuity outcomes in patients with neovascular conditions of the retina such as wet AMD and DR. 
 19

Components of KSI-301 
 KSI-301 is a bioconjugate comprised of two novel components. The first component is a recombinant, full-length humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody. The second component is a branched, optically clear phosphorylcholine biopolymer. The antibody is conjugated to the biopolymer in a one-to-one ratio through a stable and site-specific chemical linkage to form the antibody biopolymer conjugate. The molecular weight of KSI-301 is approximately 950,000 Daltons (Dalton is a standard measure of molecular weight), of which approximately 150,000 Daltons are attributable to the antibody component and 800,000 Daltons are attributable to the biopolymer component. It is well-established that substances, when injected intravitreally, with a smaller molecular weight will be cleared from ocular tissues more quickly than larger substances. 
 
Figure: Functional structure of the KSI-301 antibody biopolymer conjugate.
 Antibody Intermediate 
 The antibody intermediate of KSI-301 consists of a humanized anti-VEGF antibody. KSI-301 behaves pharmacologically similar to Lucentis by inhibiting VEGF-mediated neovascularization and vascular permeability. 
 Biopolymer Intermediate 
 The biopolymer component is a branched, optically clear phosphorylcholine biopolymer. Phosphorylcholine is a naturally occurring phospholipid head group present on the external surface of mammalian cellular membranes. Phosphorylcholine demonstrates physiological inertness that has been attributed to its molecular structure, where a permanent positive charge on the nitrogen group is equally balanced by a negative charge on the phosphate, yielding a net neutral charge over a wide range of conditions. Because of these biophysical properties, phosphorylcholine-based materials demonstrate super-hydrophilic properties in which they bind large amounts of water molecules very tightly, to create what we call “structured water.” Phosphorylcholine is used successfully in marketed medical materials as the key water control monomer, in particular as a hydrogel in certain contact lenses and as a polymeric surface coating in certain cardiac drug-eluting stents. In these applications, phosphorylcholine containing monomers are polymerized via “uncontrolled” free radical polymerization. For an external hydrogel application (contact lens) and an internal surface coating application (drug eluting stent), control of molecular weight and architecture are not important performance attributes. Kodiak’s objective was to incorporate phosphorylcholine into well-controlled biomaterials to use as conjugates for soluble, injectable medicines such as biopharmaceuticals. In such an application, control of molecular weight and architecture are important manufacturing and performance parameters. Therefore, we used controlled “living” polymerization techniques to build precise, star-shaped, high molecular weight, well-characterized phosphorylcholine-based biopolymers that preserve functional chemistry for subsequent conjugation to biologically active proteins and, once conjugated, bring a highly structured water environment into close proximity with the bioactive antibody’s target binding regions. We are also applying these controlled “living” polymerization techniques to develop phosphorylcholine-based biopolymers as copolymers of phosphorylcholine-containing and drug-containing comonomers to build chemistry-based product candidates that we believe may demonstrate high biocompatibility, high drug loading and sustained release of small molecule drugs for ophthalmology applications. 
 20

Characteristics of KSI-301 
 We believe that KSI-301 can be a highly differentiated treatment with an improved durability and bioavailability profile compared to current anti-VEGF therapies due to the following design features and resulting performance benefits we have observed with KSI-301 in our preclinical development: 
  
• | Design feature: KSI-301’s ultra-high molecular weight of 950,000 Daltons as compared to 115,000 for EYLEA, 48,000 for Lucentis and 27,000 for brolucizumab
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Associated performance benefits:
--+---------------------------------


• | 4x improvement in key ocular pharmacokinetic parameters of KSI-301, as compared to ranibizumab
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | >100x ocular concentration advantage at two months post-dosing of KSI-301, as compared to the standard of care anti-VEGF agents
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Design feature: KSI-301’s phosphorylcholine-based ABC Platform
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Associated performance benefits:
--+---------------------------------


• | 4x increase in key target ocular tissue bioavailability, as compared to EYLEA
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Same or increased bioactivity, as compared to the standard of care anti-VEGF agents
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased stability and resistance to degradation of bioconjugates compared to therapeutic proteins
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Design feature: KSI-301’s increased formulation strength of 50 mg/mL as compared to 40 mg/mL for EYLEA and 10 mg/mL for Lucentis, as measured by weight of protein moiety
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Associated performance benefits:
--+---------------------------------


• | 3.5x and 7x higher number of anti-VEGF binding sites per dose, as compared with EYLEA and Lucentis, respectively
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that the aggregated effects of these properties could afford KSI-301 a longer on-mechanism durability that will more closely match the frequency of physician visits that is realistic for patients in clinical practice. 
 We also believe that these properties along with KSI-301’s delivery by intravitreal injection position it favorably compared to other therapies being studied in the clinic with the aim of long-interval dosing in retinal vascular disease. For example, both gene therapy and an implantable drug reservoir require the patient to undergo surgery, which is generally riskier than an intravitreal injection. This need for surgery may reduce the likelihood that those technologies could be useful for or adopted by a broad range of physicians and patients, especially those patients with earlier-stage disease. An implantable drug reservoir also leaves a foreign body permanently in the eye, with an attendant increased risk of infection. Coated microsphere drug depots that deliver small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs into the eye may leave a foreign residual material, which may cause visual symptoms and/or other safety problems. Additionally, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs affect signaling through additional receptors other than VEGF receptor; the effects on the eye of this additional receptor inhibition, either good or bad, are not yet known. Finally, bispecific antibodies that target VEGF as well as other angiogenic signaling pathways are attempting to increase durability of treatment effect through targeting of yet-unvalidated biologic pathways, but the antibodies being used are the same size as typical monoclonal antibodies (~150 kDa) and we believe they do not have any unique size or half-life extending properties.

Trajectories in Field of Medicines Development for Retinal (Intravitreal) Therapies 
 Since the initial FDA approval of Lucentis in 2006 as a monthly therapy for wet AMD, efforts have been made to improve the durability of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Primarily, two parameters have been varied: size of molecule and amount of injected dose. First, increasing molecular weight, which can increase durability or ocular pharmacokinetics, or PK, in the eye because a larger molecule can lead to a slower exit from the eye. For example, Lucentis has a molecular weight of 48 kDa whereas EYLEA, approved in 2011, has a molecular weight of 115 kDa. The second parameter is increasing the formulation strength (concentration) to increase the effective dose of anti-VEGF, given the limited volume of medicine that can be injected intravitreally in a single administration. This increases effective durability by keeping drug concentrations in the eye above a minimal threshold for longer periods of time. For example, EYLEA has a 2x molar equivalence to Lucentis. In designing KSI-301, we addressed both parameters: first, increasing the molecular weight to 950 kDa through our ABC approach, and second, increasing the molar strength through a high concentration formulation of 50 mg/mL (by weight of protein). Of note, some recently developed therapeutic candidates have leveraged one parameter at the expense of the other. For example, brolucizumab was tested in Phase 3 (data available in 2017) at a high concentration and thus high injected dose level, giving it a high molar strength (22x of Lucentis), but with a molecular weight of only 27 kDa the duration of each molecule in the eye is less than that of Lucentis. Clinically, the Phase 3 result was that roughly half of patients were able to be maintained on 12 week dosing, and the remainder required 8 week (or more frequent) dosing. We believe our design decisions for KSI-301 may provide increased durability. The following figure illustrates these concepts. 
 

Affinity for and Inhibition of VEGF 
 The therapeutic activity of KSI-301 is driven by its antibody component, OG1950, which (1) binds to VEGF and (2) prevents VEGF from carrying out its functions that promote neovascularization and increase vascular permeability. Our preclinical tests have demonstrated that OG1950 and KSI-301 bind to VEGF with similar affinity, which indicates that, despite the size and complex architecture of the biopolymer intermediate, the biopolymer does not interfere with antibody binding.

 | KinExA(37°) | 2.69x105 | 1.82x10-6 | | 6.75

We have also tested OG1950 and KSI-301 in vitro alongside other anti-VEGF biologics to test their respective abilities to inhibit VEGF from binding to VEGF receptors. As shown in the figure and table below, while KSI-301 and OG1950 have similar IC50 (the concentration at which binding is reduced by half) compared to EYLEA, KSI-301 consistently demonstrates a higher maximal inhibition than EYLEA or Lucentis. Of note, KSI-301 improved maximal inhibition more than OG1950, suggesting that the special nature of our antibody biopolymer conjugate synergistically improves the bioactivity of the antibody intermediate acting alone.

Inhibition of VEGF-Mediated Processes 
 Based on its ability to bind and inhibit VEGF, KSI-301 is expected to behave pharmacologically similar to Lucentis, EYLEA and Avastin to decrease the leakage of blood proteins and fluid into the retina. In fact, in vitro testing of KSI-301 against Lucentis, EYLEA and Avastin in their respective ability to inhibit VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation (a key component of neovascularization) in primary human retina microvascular endothelial cells, or HRMVECs, showed that KSI-301 inhibited proliferation to approximately the same degree as EYLEA and with greater potency than Lucentis or Avastin. In addition, KSI-301 displayed a superior maximal inhibition of VEGF-mediated proliferation relative to EYLEA and Avastin.

Table: IC50 Values and maximal inhibition of anti-VEGF agents on VEGF-mediated proliferation of HRMVECs. IC50 values were 
 calculated from concentration of anti-VEGF agents. All values shown as average with standard deviation. 
 To mimic in vivo conditions where endothelial cells and pericytes coexist in blood vessels, a three-dimensional co-culture of HRMVECs and human mesenchymal pericytes, or HMPs, grown on beads was established. This model was then used to test the ability of KSI-301 to inhibit VEGF-mediated vascular sprouting compared to Lucentis and EYLEA. The average number of sprouts per bead and the length per sprout were analyzed under each treatment condition. 
 24

As shown in the figures below, at maximal anti-VEGF inhibition the average sprout length of cultures treated with KSI-301 was substantially less than that of the control (481 compared with 990 microns) and comparable to Lucentis and EYLEA (505 and 428 microns respectively). The average number of sprouts per bead for cultures treated with KSI-301 was 11.5, which was comparable to 13.3 and 13.0 sprouts per bead observed for the cultures treated with Lucentis and EYLEA, respectively. 
 
Figure: Effects of KSI-301 and other anti-VEGF molecules on length and number of vascular sprouts in 3-dimensional culture. 
 Extended Ocular Half-Life versus Standard of Care Agents 
 The addition of the biopolymer intermediate increases the size of the biologic, thereby extending the ocular half-life of the molecule beyond that of standard of care anti-VEGF agents. Preclinical studies with KSI-301 in the well-established rabbit ocular pharmacokinetics model have demonstrated that KSI-301 has ocular tissue half-lives of 10+ days in the retina and 12.5+ days in the choroid. This is in comparison to published data for ocular tissue half-lives for Lucentis of 2.9 days and EYLEA of 4-5 days. 
Enhanced Ocular Tissue Bioavailability versus EYLEA 
 The data also show that KSI-301, despite its large size, penetrates ocular tissues well and has a retina and choroid ocular tissue biodistribution that is more than four-fold higher than EYLEA. 
 
25

Modeling On-Mechanism Durability and Human Dose Frequency
In order to estimate the impact of high potency and extended ocular half-life on durability of effect, we used a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model that overlays rabbit ocular tissue pharmacokinetic profiles of intravitreally injected anti-VEGF therapeutics and correlates the drug levels with (1) human OCT data to define a rabbit minimal inhibitory concentration to maintain human on-mechanism durability that corresponds with human OCT outcomes, and (2) human dose frequency to define a rabbit minimal inhibitory concentration to support a dose frequency in humans which corresponds to the ability to maintain visual acuity outcomes over the long-term. Specifically, we overlay the ocular tissue pharmacokinetic profiles of Lucentis at 0.5 mg dose (the marketed dose in wet AMD), EYLEA at 2.0mg dose (the marketed dose), and bioconjugate KSI-301 at 5.0 mg dose (our selected dose), as separately tested. 
 
Our modeling suggests a single dose of KSI-301 can stay above both on-mechanism and “dosing” minimal inhibitory concentrations for longer than 12 weeks. A minimal inhibitory concentration is the minimum concentration of a drug that still has the desired therapeutic effect. The implication is that KSI-301 may on average keep the retina dry for longer than 12 weeks after dosing, allowing patients to be dosed in regular 12-week intervals or less frequently and still maintain anti-VEGF mediated visual acuity gains over the long term. This contrasts with overextending the treatment interval beyond a point where retinal swelling recurs as observed in EYLEA’s VIEW 2 Phase 3 clinical trial (as described above). 
 KSI-301 has demonstrated superior stability compared to typical protein therapeutics 
 Stability studies have shown that KSI-301 bioconjugate is stable in ex vivo vitreous for at least 4 months at 37°C. Further, forced degradation studies at the extreme condition of 64°C have shown that KSI-301 bioconjugate remains in solution and is optically clear for at least 48 hours whereas the precursor antibody protein precipitated forming an opaque white suspension within several hours. 
 Toxicology Profile 
 KSI-301 has demonstrated an attractive safety profile. In all GLP monkey toxicology studies conducted through ocular or systemic administration, KSI-301 has been well tolerated. In ocular studies, KSI-301 was dosed bilaterally via intravitreal injection at 2.5 or 5.0 mg per eye every four weeks up to seven doses and evaluated through 40 weeks. Findings were limited to a dose-related anterior segment and posterior segment mild inflammatory response, which was not associated with other ocular abnormalities. The anterior segment response declined during the interval between doses and generally the finding was not present one-week post dose. The posterior segment response was attributed to a mild immune mediated response typically observed to a humanized therapeutic in monkeys.  No drug related systemic toxicity was observed. Additionally, in a systemic administration study, KSI-301 was well tolerated up to the highest dose of 5 mg/kg when dosed intravenously every four weeks for ten weeks. In summary, the results of the toxicology studies strongly indicate that KSI-301’s well tolerated safety profile in monkeys is favorable compared to that reported for Lucentis and EYLEA.

KSI-301 Commercialization 
 We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company in marketing products. We intend to build our own commercialization capabilities over time. 
 If KSI-301 receives marketing approval, we plan to commercialize it in the United States with our own focused, specialty sales force. We believe that retinal specialists in the United States, who perform most of the medical procedures involving diseases of the back of the eye, are sufficiently concentrated that we will be able to effectively promote KSI-301 to these specialists with a sales and marketing group of fewer than 200 persons. 
 We expect to use a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize KSI-301 in markets outside the United States. 
 KSI-301 Manufacturing 
 We believe it is important to our business and success to have a reliable, high-quality clinical drug supply. As we mature as a company and approach commercial stage operations, securing reliable high-quality commercial drug supply will be critical. 
 We do not currently own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage, distribution or testing. 
 We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, or CMOs, to manufacture and supply our clinical materials to be used during the development of our product candidates. We have established relationships with several CMOs, including Lonza AG, or Lonza, for the manufacture of KSI-301, as well as certain of our other product candidates. 
 We currently do not need commercial manufacturing capacity. When and if this becomes relevant, we intend to evaluate both third-party manufacturers as well as building out internal capabilities and capacity. We may choose one or both options, or a combination of the two. 
 The process for manufacturing KSI-301 consists of conjugating our antibody intermediate with our biopolymer intermediate. Our antibody intermediate is produced in a recombinant GS-CHO (Glutamine Synthetase—Chinese Hamster Ovary) cell line in a protein-free and animal component-free medium. Our biopolymer intermediate is synthesized via a multi-step controlled “living” polymerization process, purified and formulated. Following conjugation of the intermediates, the bioconjugate drug substance is further purified, concentrated, and stored.
 To date, we have relied primarily on Lonza for the manufacture of KSI-301, and we believe we have sufficient cGMP drug substance to support our planned Phase 2 clinical development. The manufacture of KSI-301, like other biologic products, is complex and we have actively worked with Lonza to develop and refine our manufacturing process. As our need for KSI-301 increases in connection with future clinical trials and, if approved, commercial quantities, we anticipate continued interaction with Lonza to refine and scale our manufacturing process. Our agreement with Lonza for the manufacture of KSI-301 is effective until 2020, subject to customary termination provisions. We have also identified multiple other CMOs that we believe would be capable of implementing and validating our manufacturing process for KSI-301 should the need arise. 
 ABC Platform 
 We believe that our ABC Platform is well suited to extend the durability of soluble, injectable retinal medicines, while at the same providing for other useful benefits. We intend to develop additional drug candidates by applying our ABC Platform in other significant areas of unmet medical need in retina and ophthalmic disease. 
 We believe our ABC Platform differentiates us and has the potential to fuel a pipeline of differentiated, non-biosimilar product candidates in high-prevalence ophthalmic diseases. In addition to KSI-301, we have leveraged our ABC Platform to build a pipeline of potential product candidates, including: 
  
• | KSI-201, a recombinant, mammalian cell expressed dual inhibitor antibody biopolymer bioconjugate, for the treatment of wet AMD;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | KSI-401, a recombinant, mammalian cell expressed antibody biopolymer conjugate, for the treatment of dry AMD; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | KSI-501, a recombinant, mammalian cell expressed dual inhibitor antibody biopolymer conjugate, for the treatment of wet AMD and DR.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 cGMP master cell banks for both KSI-201 and KSI-401 have been completed, and we continue to evaluate each of the foregoing product candidates in various stages of development. Cell-line construction for CHO mammalian manufacturing of KSI-501is in progress, and we expect the cGMP cell bank to be completed this year.

Overview of KSI-501 
 In addition to angiogenesis, inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of retinal diseases. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as steroids have been effective in treating both uveitis (a spectrum of diseases with intraocular inflammation as a defining characteristic) and DME. Similarly, genetically inherited variations in the interleukin 6, or IL-6, gene have been associated with higher PDR incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, disease progression in AMD, DR and RVO have been reported to be associated with increased serum and/or ocular levels of IL-6. Additionally, chronic inflammatory cells have been seen on the surface of the basement membrane behind the retina in eyes with wet AMD. Interestingly, IL-6 has been implicated in resistance to anti-VEGF treatments in DME patients. This in part is believed to be an indirect result of IL-6 mediated upregulation of VEGF expression as well as more direct VEGF-independent angiogenic functions mediated by IL-6 signaling that occur in the presence of VEGF inhibitors. 
 Our KSI-501 product candidate is a dual inhibitor Trap-Antibody-Fusion, or TAF, bioconjugate molecule designed to target concurrent inflammation and abnormal angiogenesis observed in the pathogenesis of retinal vascular diseases. KSI-501 acts through an anti-VEGF mechanism similar to EYLEA and an anti-inflammatory mechanism that targets the potent cytokine IL-6. Similar to KSI-301, KSI-501 uses the ABC Platform and is a bioconjugate of the TAF protein conjugated to our phosphorylcholine-based biopolymer. Preclinical binding and functional studies demonstrate that the TAF protein binds specifically and simultaneously to its intended targets. We believe that this dual inhibition may provide a superior treatment option for patients with retinal vascular diseases and in particular those patients with diseases known to have a high inflammatory component such as DME, as well as in ocular inflammatory diseases such as uveitis.
 Components of KSI-501 
 KSI-501 is a bioconjugate of a dual inhibitor TAF protein and a phosphorylcholine-based biopolymer. The protein portion of KSI-501 has two VEGF binding domains from human VEGF receptors which together act as a trap or soluble receptor decoy to bind the most abundant isoforms of VEGF. The anti-VEGF trap domains are fused to a high-affinity IgG1 antibody that binds with high specificity and affinity to IL-6 and disrupts the ligand’s association with its cognate IL-6 receptor. Moreover, the Fc domain has been engineered to reduce immune effector function and facilitate site-specific conjugation to our phosphorylcholine-based biopolymer. 
 Notably, this IgG1 antibody sequence is identical to that from KSI-301, except for the six CDR regions that mediate target binding and which are specific for binding to the IL-6 target. Retaining the IgG1 frameworks across ABC Platform-derived product candidates enables “platform capability” which simplify manufacturing and product development. KSI-501, furthermore, uses the same cGMP biopolymer intermediate as KSI-301.

 Characteristics of KSI-501 
 We believe that KSI-501 can be a highly differentiated treatment due to its dual mechanism of action, with an improved durability and bioavailability profile due to the ABC Platform component. In addition, there are currently no IL-6 inhibitors approved for use in the eye. 
 28

We incorporated the following design features into KSI-501: 
  
• | Binds with high affinity to the most abundant isoforms of VEGF
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engineered to remove a protease hotspot to prevent cleavage in Chinese Hamster Ovary, or CHO, mammalian expression systems, which may improve potency and formulation stability
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design Feature: KSI-501’s anti-IL-6 domain 
  
• | Affinity matured, humanized anti-IL-6 IgG1 that binds with high affinity to IL-6 and inhibits binding of IL-6 to its cognate receptor
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IgG1 Fc domain engineered to reduce immune effector functions
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 Design Feature: KSI-501’s phosphorylcholine-based ABC Platform 
  
• | Ultra-high molecular weight of 1,000,000 Daltons for improved ocular pharmacokinetics
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Same IgG1 framework sequences and same phosphorylcholine-based biopolymer as KSI-301 and other ABC Platform-derived product candidates to simplify manufacturing and product development
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other benefits of the ABC Platform such as enhanced tissue access to key ocular tissues and bioconjugate stability
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note that the in vitro data shown below are generated using the TAF (protein) of KSI-501, without conjugation to our ABC biopolymer. Results using KSI-501 may be different, but experience with a structurally similar prior molecule, KSI-201, has shown that these individual components, i.e. trap antibody fusion protein and biopolymer, can function together simultaneously as a dual inhibitor bioconjugate. Prior experiences with bioconjugates KSI-201 and KSI-301 have also demonstrated that the biopolymer portion does not interfere with the bioactivity of the protein portion. 
 Affinity and concurrent binding to VEGF and IL-6 
 Preclinical studies indicate that the TAF portion of KSI-501 binds with high affinity to both VEGF and IL-6, as measured by SPR analysis (Table). Importantly, binding of each molecule has no effect on the binding of the other, and KSI-501 can bind to both molecules as shown below. Thus, we believe our dual inhibitor can simultaneously inhibit both of its targets with high potency. 
 Table: Binding kinetics of TAF portion of KSI-501 to huVEGF-A165 or IL-6 by SPR analysis.

IL-6 | 3.72x106 | 4.06x10-4 | | 109 
VEGF-A165 | 1.07x107 | 1.63x10-4 | | 15.2

Inhibition of VEGF and IL-6 
 KSI-501 was designed to inhibit both VEGF and IL-6 mediated signaling that occur after the ligands bind to their respective receptors. The figure below shows that the TAF protein of KSI-501 effectively prevents VEGF from stimulating downstream VEGFR2 signaling in a reporter assay in a comparable manner to EYLEA, while anti-IL-6 alone served as a negative control. 
 
Figure: VEGF stimulated reporter assay with increasing concentrations of anti-VEGF inhibitors 
 The figure below shows that the control anti-IL-6 antibody and TAF protein of KSI-501 effectively compete with IL-6R for binding to plate-bound IL-6 and therefore inhibit this specific antigen-receptor interaction. The IC50 values for the control anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody and the TAF protein are comparable (anti-IL-6 = 0.36 nM, KSI-501 = 0.47 nM), while EYLEA had no effect. 
 
Figure: ELISA measuring IL-6 binding to IL-6R in the presence of increasing concentrations of anti-IL-6 inhibitors 
 Together, these data indicate that the TAF protein of KSI-501 inhibits both VEGF and IL-6 from binding their cognate receptors as effectively as the monotherapies. Importantly, these data also demonstrate that the TAF protein of KSI-501 can simultaneously block downstream signaling mediated by both VEGF and IL-6. 
 30

IL-6 and VEGF mediated proliferation of HUVECs 
 The ability of the TAF protein of KSI-501 to inhibit IL-6 and VEGF mediated angiogenic functions was tested in a Human Vascular Endothelial Cell, or HUVEC, proliferation assay as shown in the figure below. Importantly, the concentrations of VEGF and IL-6 used to stimulate proliferation were below the saturation point for each individual stimulant and under these conditions VEGF and IL-6 showed some synergy for growth. The presence of TAF protein significantly attenuated proliferation to approximately 50% of maximal growth, while neither EYLEA nor control anti-IL-6 alone had quantifiable effects. These data provide supporting evidence that KSI-501 can synergistically abrogate endothelial cell proliferation that is driven by concurrent inflammatory and VEGF mediated signaling. 
 
Figure: VEGF/IL-6 mediated HUVEC proliferation in the presence of inhibitors 
 IL-6 and VEGF mediated tubule formation of HUVECs: 
 TAF protein of KSI-501 was also tested in an endothelial cell tubule formation assay. Treatment of HUVECs seeded on an extracellular basement membrane matrix (Matrigel) with VEGF and IL-6 together stimulate tubule formation to a higher degree than either treatment alone. The TAF protein of KSI-501 demonstrated superior inhibition of this tubule formation when compared to EYLEA or control anti-IL-6 antibody. 
 Furthermore, quantification of the effects of each inhibitor on twenty parameters of HUVEC tubule formation show that the TAF protein significantly inhibited 17 of 20 angiogenic parameters versus control (compared to 4 of 20 for EYLEA and 7 of 20 for control anti-IL-6 antibody). TAF protein was statistically better than EYLEA and anti-IL-6 control in 12 of 20 parameters.

 31

Together, these data show that the TAF protein of KSI-501 can simultaneously bind IL-6 and VEGF to inhibit their downstream angiogenic signaling pathways. We believe that this novel dual inhibitor can provide an alternative option for the treatment of retinal vascular diseases, especially those that have a high inflammatory component and/or that do not respond adequately to anti-VEGF treatments alone. 
 Research and Development 
 We have committed, and expect to continue to commit, significant resources to enhancing our ABC Platform and developing new product candidates. We have assembled experienced research and development teams at our Palo Alto, California location with scientific, clinical and regulatory personnel. As of December 31, 2018, we had 23 employees primarily engaged in research and development. Of these employees, 12 hold a Ph.D. degree or M.D. (or equivalent) degree. From time to time we engage individuals to assist with certain research and development activities on a contractual basis for limited time periods. Our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $18.8 million and $22.0 million, respectively. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic or biosimilar drug companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring products, product candidates or other technologies complementary to our programs. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of KSI-301, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, method and frequency of administration, on-mechanism durability of therapeutic effect, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. The method of administration of KSI-301, intravitreal injection, is commonly used to administer ophthalmic drugs for the treatment of severe disease and is generally accepted by patients facing the prospect of severe visual loss or blindness. However, a therapy that offers a less invasive method of administration might have a competitive advantage over one administered by intravitreal injection, depending on the relative safety of the other method of administration. 
 The current standard of care for wet AMD and advanced stages of DR is monotherapy administration of anti-VEGF drugs, principally Avastin, Lucentis and EYLEA, which are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Physicians, patients and third-party payors may not accept the addition of KSI-301 to their current treatment regimens for a variety of potential reasons, including: 
  
• | if they do not wish to incur the additional cost of KSI-301;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | if they perceive the addition of KSI-301 to be of limited benefit to patients;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if they wish to treat with more than an anti-VEGF drug;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | if sufficient coverage and reimbursement are not available;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | if they do not perceive KSI-301 to have a favorable risk-benefit profile.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 32

We are developing KSI-301 as an alternative to existing anti-VEGF drugs, including Avastin, Lucentis and EYLEA. Accordingly, KSI-301 would directly compete with these therapies. While we believe KSI-301 will compete favorably with existing anti-VEGF drugs, future approved standalone or combination therapies for wet AMD with demonstrated improved efficacy over KSI-301 or currently marketed therapies with a favorable safety profile and any of the following characteristics might pose a significant competitive threat to us: 
  
• | a mechanism of action that does not involve VEGF;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | a duration of action that obviates the need for frequent intravitreal injection;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a method of administration that avoids intravitreal injection; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | significant cost savings or reimbursement advantages compared to KSI-301 and other anti-VEGF therapies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if one or more of our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. A drug with greater convenience than KSI-301 might make such a drug more attractive to physicians and patients. An anti-VEGF gene therapy product might substantially reduce the number and frequency of intravitreal injections when treating wet AMD or DR, making KSI-301 unattractive to physicians and patients. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. 
 In addition to currently available therapies, we are aware of a number of products in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat wet AMD and DR. We expect that product candidates currently in clinical development, or that could enter clinical development in the near future, that inhibit the function of VEGF or inhibit the function of both VEGF and other factors, could represent significant competition if approved. These product candidates may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. For example, we are aware that Novartis is developing brolucizumab, an anti-VEGF single-chain antibody fragment for the treatment of wet AMD, which recently completed two Phase 3 studies versus EYLEA. In these trials, brolucizumab met the primary efficacy endpoint of noninferiority to EYLEA in mean change in best-corrected visual acuity from baseline to week 48. In addition, Allergan is developing a competing anti-VEGF therapy, abicipar, which is part of a new class of drugs called DARPin therapies that uses genetically modified antibody proteins. Positive efficacy data from Allergan’s Phase 3 studies for abicipar in wet AMD were reported in 2018, demonstrating non-inferiority to ranibizumab but with a 15% incidence rate of ocular inflammation in the abicipar groups. There are also several companies and research organizations pursuing treatments targeting other molecular targets, potential gene therapy treatments, stem cell transplant treatments and medical devices for the treatment of wet AMD and DR. 
 Because there are a variety of means to treat wet AMD and DR, our patents and other proprietary protections for KSI-301 will not prevent development or commercialization of product candidates that are different from KSI-301. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
 33

U.S. Drug Development 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Any future product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a new drug application, or NDA, or a biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
--+----------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The data required to support an NDA or BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. 
 Preclinical Studies and IND 
 The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. 
 34

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical Trials 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 
 Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap. 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 35

Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life. 
 NDA/BLA Review Process 
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for human drugs and biologics and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs and biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and 
 36

time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. 
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. 
 Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar or Interchangeable 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, or Affordable Care Act, or ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing, and thereby lower development costs and increase patient access to affordable treatments. An application for licensure of a biosimilar product must include information demonstrating biosimilarity based upon the following, unless the FDA determines otherwise: 

• | analytical studies demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the approved product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more conditions for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 37

In addition, an application must include information demonstrating that: 
  
• | the proposed biosimilar product and reference product utilize the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the proposed biosimilar product are the same as those for the reference product; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Biosimilarity means that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. In addition, the law provides for a designation of “interchangeability” between the reference and biosimilar products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that: 
  
• | the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | the proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the United States. However, complexities associated with the large and intricate structures of biological products and the process by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to the FDA’s implementation of the law that are still being worked out by the FDA. For example, the FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence—laboratory, preclinical and/or clinical—required to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product. 
 The FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence, provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, and recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. Biosimilar product applications thus may not be required to duplicate the entirety of preclinical and clinical testing used to establish the underlying safety and effectiveness of the reference product. However, the FDA may refuse to approve a biosimilar application if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same or to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in active ingredients do not affect the safety, purity or potency of the biosimilar product. In addition, as with BLAs, biosimilar product applications will not be approved unless the product is manufactured in facilities designed to assure and preserve the biological product’s safety, purity and potency. 
 The submission of a biosimilar application does not guarantee that the FDA will accept the application for filing and review, as the FDA may refuse to accept applications that it finds are insufficiently complete. The FDA will treat a biosimilar application or supplement as incomplete if, among other reasons, any applicable user fees assessed under the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 have not been paid. In addition, the FDA may accept an application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical or clinical studies and submit a BLA for licensure as a new biological product. 
 The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the branded product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for twelve years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. A reference product may also be entitled to exclusivity under other statutory provisions. For example, a reference product designated for a rare disease or condition (an “orphan drug”) may be entitled to seven years of exclusivity, in which case no product that is biosimilar to the reference product may be approved until either the end of the twelve-year period provided under the biosimilarity statute or the end of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period, whichever occurs later. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block biosimilarity applications from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension. 
 38

The first biological product determined to be interchangeable with a branded product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. This exclusivity period extends until the earlier of: (1) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (2) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (3) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing; or (4) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse experiences, and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 Other U.S. Regulatory Matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. 
 39

For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. 
 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 The distribution of biologic and pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (1) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (2) additions or modifications to product labeling; (3) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (4) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 40

A reference biological product is granted twelve years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. 
 European Union Drug Development 
 As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. 
 The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU. 
 European Union Drug Review and Approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations. 

• | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 People’s Republic of China Drug Regulation 
 China heavily regulates the development, approval, manufacturing and distribution of drugs, including biologics. The specific regulatory requirements applicable depend on whether the drug is made and finished in China, which is referred to as a domestically manufactured drug, or made abroad and imported into China in finished form, which is referred to as an imported drug, as well as the approval or “registration” category of the drug. For both imported and domestically manufactured drugs, China typically requires regulatory approval for a clinical trial, or CTA, prior to submitting an application for marketing approval. For a domestically manufactured drug, there is also a requirement for a drug manufacturing license for a facility in China. 
In 2017, the drug regulatory system entered a new and significant period of reform. The State Council and the China Communist Party jointly issued the Opinion on Deepening the Reform of the Regulatory Approval System to Encourage Innovation in Drugs and Medical Devices, or the Innovation Opinion. The expedited programs and other advantages under this and other recent reforms encourage drug manufacturers to seek market approval in China first, manufacture domestically, and develop drugs in high priority disease areas. 
 To implement the regulatory reform introduced by the Innovation Opinion, the China Drug Authority, or CDA, is currently revising the fundamental laws, regulations and rules regulating pharmaceutical products and the industry, which include the framework law known as the PRC Drug Administration Law, or DAL. The DAL is also generally implemented by a set of regulations issued by the State Council referred to as the DAL Implementing Regulation. The CDA has its own set of regulations implementing the DAL; the primary one governing clinical trial applications, marketing approval, and license renewal and amendment is known as the Drug Registration Regulation. However, the implementing regulations for many of the reforms in the Innovation Opinion had not been announced, and therefore, the details in the implementation of the regulatory changes remained uncertain in some respects. 
 Regulatory Authorities and Recent Government Reorganization 
 In the PRC, the CDA is the primary regulator for pharmaceutical products and businesses. It regulates almost all of the key stages of the life-cycle of pharmaceutical products, including nonclinical studies, clinical trials, marketing approvals, manufacturing, advertising and promotion, distribution, and pharmacovigilance (i.e., post-marketing safety reporting obligations). The CDE, which is under the CDA, conducts the technical evaluation of each drug and biologic application for safety and effectiveness. 
 The National Health and Family Planning Commission, or NHFPC, formerly known as the Ministry of Health, or MOH, is China’s chief healthcare regulator. It is primarily responsible for overseeing the operation of medical institutions, which also serve as clinical trial sites, and regulating the licensure of hospitals and other medical personnel. NHFPC plays a significant role in drug reimbursement. Furthermore, the NHFPC and its local counterparts at or below the provincial-level of local government also oversee and organize public medical institutions’ centralized bidding and procurement process for pharmaceutical products. This is the chief way that public hospitals and their internal pharmacies acquire drugs. 
 China has recently reorganized the agencies that regulate drugs, healthcare, and the state health insurance plans, although it is still not entirely clear what effect on policy these changes will ultimately have in terms of making the drug approval process more efficient. The drug regulatory agency, CFDA, is merged into a State Administration on Market Regulation, or SAMR, along with other agencies that regulate consumer protection, product quality and anti-monopoly. The drug, device and cosmetic regulatory functions of CFDA is put under the CDA, which is subordinate to the SAMR. The National Health Commission, or the NHC, will be the healthcare regulator replacing the NHFPC, and a new, separate State Medical Insurance Bureau will focus on regulating reimbursement under the state-sponsored insurance plans. 
 Pre-Clinical and Clinical Development 
 The CDA requires both pre-clinical and clinical data to support registration applications for imported and domestic drugs. Pre-clinical work, including pharmacology and toxicology studies, must meet the GLP, issued in July 2017. The CDA accredits GLP labs and requires that nonclinical studies on chemical drug substances and preparations and biologics that are not yet marketed in China be conducted there. There are no approvals required from the CDA to conduct pre-clinical studies. 
 42

Registration Categories 
 Prior to engaging with the CDA on research and development and approval, an applicant will need to determine the registration category for its drug candidate (which will ultimately need to be confirmed with the CDA), which will determine the requirements for its clinical trial and marketing application. There are five categories for small molecule drugs: Category 1 (“innovative drugs”) refers to drugs that have a new chemical entity that has not been marketed anywhere in the world, Category 2 (“improved new drugs”) refers to drugs with a new indication, dosage form, route of administration, combination, or certain formulation changes not approved in the world, Categories 3 and 4 are for generics that reference an innovator drug (or certain well-known generic drugs) marketed either abroad or in China, respectively, and Category 5 refers to originator or generic drugs that have already been marketed abroad but are not yet approved in China (i.e., many imported drugs). 
 Therapeutic biologics follow a similar categorization, with Category 1 being new to the world, but with fifteen product-specific categories. Like with small molecule drugs, Category 1 for biologics is also for innovative biologics that have not been approved inside or outside of China. A clear regulatory pathway for biosimilars does not yet exist, but the CDA may soon develop one in its revision of implementing rules pursuant to the Innovation Opinion. We have not yet discussed with the CDA the categorization of any of our product candidates, including KSI-301. 
 Expedited Programs – Priority Evaluation and Approval Programs to Encourage Innovation 
 The CDA has adopted several expedited review and approval mechanisms since 2009 and created additional expedited programs in recent years that are intended to encourage innovation. Applications for these expedited programs can be submitted after the CTA is admitted for review by the CDE. If admitted to one of these expedited programs, an applicant will be entitled to more frequent and timely communication with reviewers at the CDE, expedited review and approval, and more agency resources throughout the approval process. 
Clinical Trials and Marketing Approval 
 Upon completion of pre-clinical studies, a sponsor typically needs to conduct clinical trials in China for registering a new drug in China. The materials required for this application and the data requirements are determined by the registration category. The CDA has taken a number of steps to increase efficiency for approving CTAs, and it has also significantly increased monitoring and enforcement of GCP to ensure data integrity. 
Trial Approval 
 All clinical trials conducted in China must be approved and conducted at hospitals accredited by the CDA. For imported drugs, proof of foreign approval is required prior to the trial, unless the drug has never been approved anywhere in the world. In addition to a standalone China trial to support development, imported drug applicants may establish a site in China that is part of an international multicenter trial, or IMCT, at the outset of the global trial. Domestically manufactured drugs are not subject to foreign approval requirements, and in contrast to prior practice, the CDA has recently indicated its intent to permit those drugs to conduct development via an IMCT as well. 
 In 2015, the CDA began to issue an umbrella approval for all phases (typically three) of a new drug clinical trial, instead of issuing approval phase by phase. For certain types of new drug candidates, clinical trial applications may be prioritized over other applications, and put in a separate expedited queue for approval. Other trials that are not part of these expedited lines could still wait up to a year for approval to conduct the trial. 
 The Innovation Opinion also introduces a notification system for new drug clinical trial approval. In other words, trials can proceed if after certain fixed period of time (possibly 60 days), the applicant has not received any objections from the CDE, as opposed to the lengthier current clinical trial pre-approval process in which the applicant must wait for affirmative approval. The Innovation Opinion also promises to expand the number of trial sites by truncating the timeline for accreditation by converting it from a pre-approval procedure into a notification procedure. These reforms will require implementing law and regulations in order to proceed in practice. The CDA proposed implementing legislation in 2017 but it has not yet been finalized. 
 Clinical Trial Process and Good Clinical Practices 
 Typically drug clinical trials in China have three phases. Phase 1 refers to the initial clinical pharmacology and human safety evaluation studies. Phase 2 refers to the preliminary evaluation of a drug candidate’s therapeutic efficacy and safety for target indication(s) in patients. Phase 3 (often the pivotal study) refers to clinical trials to further verify the drug candidate’s therapeutic efficacy and safety on patients with target indication(s) and ultimately provide sufficient evidence for the review of drug registration application. The CDA requires that the different phases of clinical trials in China receive ethics committee approval prior to approval of the CTA and comply with GCP. The CDA conducts inspections to assess GCP compliance and will cancel the CTA if it finds substantial issues. 
 43

The CDA may reduce requirements for trials and data, depending on the drug and the existing data. The CDA has granted waivers for all or part of trials, but it is now planning to take a more official position on the acceptance of foreign data to support an application. The foreign data must meet the CDA’s requirements, including, for drugs that have never been approved before in China, having sufficient Chinese ethnic data. The precise requirements are not yet clear. 
 New Drug Application (NDA) and Approval 
 Upon completion of clinical trials, a sponsor may submit clinical trial data to support marketing approval for the drug. For imported drugs, this means issuance of an import license. Again, the applicant must submit evidence of foreign approval, unless it is an innovative drug that has never been approved anywhere in the world. 
 Domestically manufactured drugs must similarly submit data in support of a drug approval number. Under the current regime, upon approval of the registration application, the CDA will first issue a new drug certificate to the applicant. Only when the applicant is equipped with relevant manufacturing capability will the CDA issue a Drug Approval Serial Number, which is effectively the marketing approval allowing the holder to market/commercialize the drug in China. 
 Under the authorization of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, the State Council issued the Pilot Plan for the Drug Marketing Authorization Holder Mechanism on May 26, 2016, which provides a detailed pilot plan for the marketing authorization holder system, or MAH pilot program. Domestically established research institutions (including domestic companies) can apply through an MAH pilot program if they are established in one of 10 designated provinces (including Beijing and Shanghai) in China. The MAH pilot program permits research institutions and individuals to develop and hold the marketing approvals for drugs without holding a drug manufacturing license. The marketing authorization holders, or MAHs, may engage contract manufacturers and distributors. 
 The MAH pilot program is set to run until November 4, 2019. The Innovation Opinion indicates that China will strive to implement the MAH system nationally as soon as possible by amending the DAL. The CDA has proposed revisions to accomplish this purpose, but the timeline to finalize these proposals is still unclear. 
 New Drug Monitoring Period 
 Currently, new varieties of domestically produced drugs approved under Categories 1 or 2 in China may be placed under a monitoring period for three to five years. Category 1 innovative drugs will be monitored for five years. During the monitoring period, the CDA will not approve another CTA from another applicant for the same type of drug, except if another sponsor has an approved CTA at the time that the monitoring period is initiated it may proceed with its trial and become part of the period. Therefore, by blocking other CTAs, the monitoring period can act as a type of market exclusivity. 
Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Trial Studies 
 On July 10, 2018, the CDA issued the Technical Guidance Principles on Accepting Foreign Drug Clinical Trial Data, or the Guidance Principles, as one of the implementing rules for the Innovation Opinion. According to the Guidance Principles, sponsors may use the data of foreign clinical trials to support drug registration in China, provided that sponsors must ensure the authenticity, completeness and accuracy of foreign clinical trial data and such data must be obtained consistent with the relevant requirements under the Good Clinical Trial Practice (GCP) of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). Sponsors must also comply with other relevant sections of the Drug Registration Regulation when applying for drug registrations in China using foreign clinical trial data. 
 Post-Marketing Surveillance 
 The manufacturer or marketing authorization holder of marketing approval is primarily responsible for pharmacovigilance, including quality assurance, adverse reaction reporting and monitoring, and product recalls. Distributors and user entities (e.g., hospitals) are also required to report, in their respective roles, adverse reactions of the products they sell or use, and assist with the manufacturer of the product recall. A drug that is currently under the new drug monitoring period has to report all adverse drug reactions (as opposed to just serious adverse reactions) for that period. 
 Advertising and Promotion of Pharmaceutical Products 
 China has a strict regime for the advertising of approved medicines. No unapproved medicines may be advertised. The definition of an advertisement is very broad, and does not exclude scientific exchange. It can be any media that directly or indirectly introduces the product to end users. There is no clear line between advertising and any other type of promotion. 
 44

Other PRC national- and provincial-level laws and regulations 
 We are subject to changing regulations under many other laws and regulations administered by governmental authorities at the national, provincial and municipal levels, some of which are or may become applicable to our business. For example, regulations control the confidentiality of patients’ medical information and the circumstances under which patient medical information may be released for inclusion in our databases, or released by us to third parties. The privacy of human subjects in clinical trials is also protected under regulations, e.g., the case report forms must avoid disclosing names of the human subjects. 
 These laws and regulations governing both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information may become more restrictive in the future, including restrictions on transfer of healthcare data. The Cybersecurity Law that took effect in 2017 designates healthcare as a priority area that is part of critical information infrastructure, and China’s cyberspace administration is trying to finalize a draft rule on cross-border transfer of personal information. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs. 
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well. 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
 45

For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. In 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug prices are determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. 
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field. Although we are not party to any material in-license agreements as of the date of this annual report, we may in the future pursue in-licensing opportunities to strengthen our proprietary position in the field. We additionally rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions when available, and may seek and rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 
 We have prosecuted numerous patents and patent applications and possess know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our ABC Platform and product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology. As of December 31, 2018, we were the assignee of record for approximately three U.S. issued patents, and approximately ten U.S. pending patent applications directed to certain of our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements and our most advanced product candidates, as well as approximately 14 patents issued in jurisdictions outside of the United States and approximately 51 patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside of the United States that, in many cases, are counterparts to the foregoing U.S. patents and patent applications. We also have one pending PCT application. For example, these patents and patent applications include claims directed to: 
  
• | therapeutic proteins and biologically active agents conjugated to a biopolymer, which comprise our ABC Platform;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | specific therapeutics, including KSI-301; and
--+----------------------------------------------


• | components of our therapeutics.

In the normal course of business, we intend to pursue, when possible, composition, method of use, dosing and formulation patent protection, as well as manufacturing and drug development processes and technology. The patents and patent applications we have filed outside of the United States are in Europe, Japan, and various other jurisdictions. 
 Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. 
 Our issued U.S. patents will expire on dates ranging from 2027 to 2035. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2027 to 2038. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 47

We have filed 18 trademark applications. These include two applications that have matured to registration in the United States, both of which have been cancelled. Ten of our applications have matured to registration, of which six are in China, and one is in each of the European Union, Japan, Singapore and Switzerland. We have six pending trademark applications, of which five are in the United States and one is in Canada. We also may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section on “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
 We are also a party to an assignment and license agreement with a former collaborator, whereby we were assigned and non-exclusively licensed certain intellectual property relating to KSI-201 and related technology. Under this agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize KSI-201, and will owe milestone payments to our former collaborator upon the achievement of certain milestones related to KSI-201, as well as a low single digit percentage royalty on net sales of KSI-201. The assignment and license agreement includes customary termination provisions, including the right of the company to terminate for convenience and the right of either party to terminate for cause. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 28 employees, all of whom were full-time and 23 of whom were engaged in research and development activities. Approximately 12 of our employees hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. Substantially all our employees are located in Palo Alto, California. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. 
Facilities 
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Palo Alto, California, where we lease approximately 11,000 square feet of office, research and development, engineering and laboratory space pursuant to a lease agreement which commenced in October 2013 and would expire in October 2018. In March 2016, we executed a third lease amendment agreement that became effective March 31, 2016 and extended the lease term until October 31, 2023. This facility houses all our personnel. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our near-term needs but expect to need additional space as we grow. We believe that suitable additional or alternative space would be available as required in the future on commercially reasonable terms. 
Legal Proceedings 
 As of the date of this annual report, we are not a party to any material legal proceedings. In the normal course of business, we may be named as a party to various legal claims, actions and complaints. We cannot predict whether any resulting liability would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Corporate Information
 We were formed as a limited liability company on June 22, 2009 under the name Oligasis LLC, and subsequently changed our name to Kodiak Sciences Inc. and converted into a corporation which was incorporated in the state of Delaware on September 8, 2015. Our mailing address and executive offices are located at 2631 Hanover Street, Palo Alto, California. We maintain an internet website at the following address: https://kodiak.com.
