Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to December 31st of each year. Our fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 (“2022”) and January 1, 2022 (“2021”) included fifty-two weeks of operations.

Overview
We are a leading automotive aftermarket parts provider in North America, serving both professional installers (“professional”) and “do-it-yourself” (“DIY”) customers, as well as independently owned operators. Our stores and branches offer a broad selection of brand names, original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) and owned brand automotive replacement parts, accessories, batteries and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars, vans, sport utility vehicles and light and heavy duty trucks. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 4,770 total stores and 316 branches primarily under the trade names “Advance Auto Parts,” “Carquest” and “Worldpac.”
We were founded in 1929 as Advance Stores Company, Incorporated, and operated as a retailer of general merchandise until the 1980s. During the 1980s, we began targeting the sale of automotive parts and accessories to DIY customers. We initiated our professional delivery program in 1996 and have steadily increased our sales to professional customers since 2000. We have grown significantly as a result of strategic acquisitions, new store openings and comparable store sales growth. Advance Auto Parts, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 2001 in conjunction with the acquisition of Discount Auto Parts, Inc. In 2014, we acquired General Parts International, Inc. (“GPI”), a privately held company that was a leading distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket automotive replacement products for professional markets operating under the Carquest and Worldpac trade names. 
Stores and Branches
Key factors in selecting sites and market locations in which we operate include population, demographics, traffic count, vehicle profile, competitive landscape and the cost of real estate. During 2022, 144 stores and branches were opened and 30 were closed or consolidated, resulting in a total of 5,086 stores and branches as of December 31, 2022 compared with a total of 4,972 stores and branches as of January 1, 2022.
Through our integrated operating approach, we serve our professional and DIY customers through a variety of channels ranging from traditional “brick and mortar” store locations to self-service e-commerce sites. We believe we are better able to meet our customers’ needs by operating under several trade names, which are as follows: 
Advance Auto Parts — Our 4,440 stores, inclusive of 328 hubs, as of December 31, 2022 are generally located in freestanding buildings with a focus on both professional and DIY customers. The average size of an Advance Auto Parts store is approximately 7,800 square feet. These stores carry a wide variety of products serving aftermarket auto part needs for both domestic and import vehicles. Our Advance Auto Parts stores carry a product offering of approximately 23,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”), consisting of a custom mix of products based on each store’s unique market. Supplementing our stores’ inventory on-hand, less common SKUs are also available on a same-day or next-day basis from any of our larger hub stores.
Carquest — Our 330 stores as of December 31, 2022, including 148 stores in Canada, are generally located in freestanding buildings with a primary focus on professional customers, but also serve DIY customers. The average size of a Carquest store is approximately 7,300 square feet. These stores carry a wide variety of products serving the aftermarket auto part needs for both domestic and import vehicles with a product offering of approximately 25,000 SKUs. As of December 31, 2022, Carquest also serves 1,311 independently owned stores that operate under the Carquest name.
Worldpac — Our 316 branches, of which 135 are branded Autopart International (“AI”), as of December 31, 2022 principally serve professional customers utilizing an efficient and sophisticated online ordering and fulfillment system. Worldpac’s branches are generally larger than our other store locations, averaging approximately 18,400 square feet. Worldpac’s complete product offering includes over 285,000 SKUs for domestic and import vehicles and specializes in imported OEM parts. As part of our transformation efforts through December 31, 2022, we have converted all AI stores into the Worldpac technology format.

Store Development
The key factors used in selecting sites and market locations in which we operate include population, demographics, traffic count, vehicle profile, number and strength of competitors’ stores, and the cost of real estate.

Supply Chain
Our supply chain consists of a network of distribution centers, hubs, stores, and branches that enable us to provide same-day or next-day availability to our customers. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 50 distribution centers, ranging in size from approximately 57,000 to 943,000 square feet with total square footage of approximately 12.6 million, including one distribution center dedicated to reclamations. In 2022, we closed distribution centers in Riverside, California and Anchorage, Alaska.
Merchandise, Marketing and Advertising
In 2022, we purchased merchandise from over 1,400 vendors, with no single vendor accounting for more than 10% of purchases. Our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other provisions, including pricing, rebates, volume and payment terms.
Our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories that we believe will appeal to our professional customers and also generate DIY customer traffic. Some of our brands include Bosch®, Castrol®, Dayco®, Denso®, Fram®, Gates®, Meguiar’sTM, Mobil 1TM, Moog®, Monroe®, NGK®, Prestone®, Purolator®, Trico® and Wagner®. In addition to these branded products, we stock a wide selection of high-quality owned brand products with a goal of appealing to value-conscious customers. These categories of merchandise include chemicals, interior automotive accessories, batteries and parts under various owned brand names such as Autopart International®, Carquest®, DieHard®, Driveworks® and Wearever®. For the DieHard® brand, we own the right to sell batteries and to extend the DieHard® brand into other automotive and vehicular categories. We granted the seller an exclusive royalty-free, perpetual license to develop, market and sell DieHard® branded products in certain non-automotive categories.
Our marketing and advertising program is designed to drive brand awareness, consideration by consumers and omnichannel traffic by position in the aftermarket auto parts category. We strive to exceed our customers’ expectations end-to-end through a comprehensive online and in-store pick up experience, extensive parts assortment, quality brands, experienced parts professionals, professional programs that are designed to build loyalty with our customers and our DIY customer loyalty program. Our DIY campaign was developed around a multi-channel communications plan that brings together radio, television, digital marketing, social media, sponsorships, store execution, public relations and Speed Perks (our customer loyalty program).
Seasonality
Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months. In addition, our business can be affected by weather conditions. While unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods, extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate. Our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending trade-offs typically influence our professional and DIY sales.
Human Capital Management
We believe our People are Our Best Part, and we have adopted six Cultural Beliefs to help us foster a culture that fully engages our team members with our business: Speak Up, Be Accountable, Take Action, Move Forward, Grow Talent and Champion Inclusion. Our Cultural Belief of Grow Talent highlights the importance to us of developing our team members in their careers, and we seek to not only recruit the best talent, but also retain and promote the best talent. Through another Cultural Belief, Champion Inclusion, we seek to fully leverage the ideas and talents of all our team members in caring for our customers and each other. We encourage our team members to Speak Up and promote their engagement through a variety of programs and networks within our organization. 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 40,000 full-time team members and approximately 27,000 part-time team members. Our workforce consisted of 82% of our team members employed in store-level operations, 13% in distribution and 5% in our corporate offices. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 2% of our team members were represented by labor unions. 
Additional information about our human capital resources can be found in our Corporate Sustainability and Social Report, which is available on our website. Our Corporate Sustainability and Social Report is not, and will not be deemed to be, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Intellectual Property 
We own a number of trade names, service marks and trademarks, including “Advance Auto Parts®,” “Advance Same Day®,” “Autopart International®,” “Carquest®,” “CARQUEST Technical Institute®,” “DieHard®,” “DriverSide®,” “MotoLogic®,” “MotoShop®,” “speedDIAL®,” “TECH-NET Professional Auto Service®” and “Worldpac®” for use in connection with the automotive parts business. In addition, we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our owned brands. We believe that these trade names, service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy. We do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and trademarks and we actively defend and enforce them.
Competition 
We operate in both the professional and DIY markets of the automotive aftermarket industry. Our primary competitors are (i) both national and regional chains of automotive parts stores, including AutoZone, Inc., NAPA, O’Reilly Automotive, Inc., The Pep Boys-Manny, Moe & Jack and Auto Plus (formerly Uni-Select USA, Inc.), (ii) internet-based retailers, (iii) discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products, (iv) wholesalers or jobbers stores, including those associated with national parts distributors or associations, (v) independently owned stores and (vi) automobile dealers that supply parts. We believe that chains of automotive parts stores that, like us, have multiple locations in one or more markets, have competitive advantages in customer service, marketing, inventory selection, purchasing and distribution compared with independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers. The principal methods of competition in our business include brand recognition, customer service, product offerings, availability, quality, service with speed, price and store location.
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business, including those governing collection, transportation and recycling of automotive lead-acid batteries, used motor oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property. We sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business. In addition, our customers may bring automotive lead-acid batteries, used motor oil or other recyclable items onto our properties. We currently provide collection and recycling programs for used lead-acid batteries, used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers. Pursuant to agreements with third-party vendors, lead-acid batteries, used motor oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members, deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third-party vendors for recycling or proper disposal. The terms of our contracts with third-party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our third-party vendors who arrange for the removal, disposal, treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal, treatment or other site affected by such substances. Based on our experience, we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting lead-acid batteries, used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third-party vendors.
We own and lease real property. Under various environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. From time to time, we receive notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own, lease or operate or may have owned, leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible. Compliance with these laws and regulations and clean-up of released hazardous substances have not had, and do not anticipate to have, a material impact on our operations.
We are also subject to numerous regulations including those related to labor and employment, discrimination, anti-bribery/anti-corruption, product quality and safety standards, data privacy and taxes. Compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date. For more information, see the following disclosures in “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” elsewhere in this report.
