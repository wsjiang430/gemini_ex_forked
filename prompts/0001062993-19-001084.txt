 Item 1. Business
INTRODUCTION 
 SunOpta, a corporation organized under the laws of Canada in 1973, is a leading global company operating businesses focused on a healthy products portfolio that promotes sustainable well-being. We are focused on sourcing non-genetically modified (non-GMO) and organic ingredients and manufacturing healthy food and beverage products. We operate an integrated field-to-table business model leveraging our global ingredient sourcing platform to process and market non-GMO and organic ingredients for retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice operators. We also manufacture packaged products focused on the high growth healthy beverages, healthy fruit and healthy snacks categories for our retail, foodservice and branded food customers. We believe we are a North American market leader in non-dairy organic aseptic beverages, premium refrigerated private label orange juice, individually quick frozen (IQF) organic fruit, healthy premium fruit snacks, and the global sourcing and supply of non-GMO and organic raw materials and ingredients. Our scalable global sourcing platform makes us one of the leading suppliers of non-GMO and organic raw materials and ingredients in the food industry, and provides us leading insights into emerging food and beverage trends. Our product portfolio is strategically aligned with the fast-growing consumer demand for high quality, healthy non-GMO and organic food and beverage products.
 Our vertically integrated business model makes us a preferred partner to our retail (e.g., grocery, mass, club, natural and specialty chains), foodservice and branded food customers. We deliver a diverse, innovative portfolio of high quality food and beverage products supported by our global sourcing platform, scalable operating footprint, manufacturing expertise and commitment to innovation. This platform enables us to consistently supply our customers with a broad range of non-GMO and organic ingredients as well as high quality healthy food and beverage products that cater to the evolving demands of todays consumers. As a leading supplier of non-GMO and organic ingredients to the food industry, we leverage our insights into emerging consumer tastes and preferences to develop innovative new food and beverage products. 
 Our Product Portfolio
 Our diverse consumer products portfolio utilizes non-GMO and organic raw materials and ingredients that are sourced primarily by our vertically integrated global ingredients capabilities, and consists of three main commercial platforms:


Healthy Beverages  We offer a full line of aseptic beverages,
 comprising non-dairy beverages (including almond, soy, coconut, oat, hemp,
 rice and others), broths, teas and nutritional beverages. We also offer
 refrigerated premium juices, shelf-stable juices and functional waters. We
 believe we are the leading North American provider of non- dairy organic
 aseptic beverages and premium refrigerated private label organic orange juice.
 

Healthy Fruit  We offer IQF fruit for retail (e.g., strawberries,
 blueberries, mango, pineapple, blends and other berries and fruit), IQF and
 bulk frozen fruit for foodservice (e.g., purées, fruit cups and smoothies),
 and custom fruit preparations for industrial use. We believe we are the
 leading North American provider of private label non-GMO and organic IQF
 fruit. 

Healthy Snacks  We offer fruit snacks (including bars, twists,
 ropes and bite-sized varieties), and roasted grain and seed snacks. We believe
 we are a leading North American provider of premium healthy fruit snacks.
 During 2017, we exited our flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar product
 lines and operations, which were formerly part of the Healthy Snacks platform.
 
 Our global ingredients platform is focused on the procurement and sale of non-GMO and organic grains and seeds (including ancient grains and seeds), fruits, vegetables, sweeteners, coffees, nuts, cocoa and other products as ingredients in both raw material and processed ingredient forms. In addition to supplying ingredients for our own healthy food and beverage product portfolio, we are a leading supplier of raw materials and processed ingredients to a number of global food manufacturers and foodservice operators. Our vertically integrated model allows us to leverage our scalable and diverse supply of high quality non-GMO and organic ingredients, adding value to a product at multiple stages of the supply chain and delivering comprehensive non-GMO and organic food ingredients and packaged goods solutions to our customers evolving demands. This model allows us to generate additional revenue from our global ingredients customers by providing them with high quality healthy food and beverage products.
 Using our vertically integrated business model, we process non-GMO and organic food ingredients into consumer-packaged products. Our food ingredients are converted from raw materials, and our raw materials are sourced from approximately 5,000 suppliers encompassing approximately 10,000 growers in over 65 countries. Our employees and assets, which include 20 processing and packaging facilities, are principally located in North America and Europe, with smaller sourcing and processing operations in Africa and China. Our operations and capabilities provide the flexibility to modify our product portfolio to adapt to the changing consumer needs for non-GMO and organic food and beverage products. As a general principle, we do not own or operate our own farms, retail stores, or extensively market our own consumer brands.

-------------+---+-----------------------------


Our commitment and proactive approach to new product development and innovation drives our ability to introduce new higher margin food and beverage products to the market. The resources of our advanced innovation center in Edina, Minnesota, support our product development activities, with a dedicated team of food scientists, engineers and technicians, who proactively engage customers in creating and developing new products. Our innovation platform supports our leadership position in non-GMO and organic food and strengthens our relationships with our retail, foodservice and contract manufacturing customers. 
 Sale of Specialty and Organic Soy and Corn Business
 On February 22, 2019, our subsidiary, SunOpta Grains and Foods Inc., completed the sale of our specialty and organic soy and corn business to Pipeline Foods, LLC (Pipeline Foods) for $66.5 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The soy and corn business engaged in seed and grain conditioning and corn milling and formed part of our North American-based raw material sourcing and supply operating segment, included in the Global Ingredients reportable segment. The business included five facilities located in Hope, Minnesota, Blooming Prairie, Minnesota, Ellendale, Minnesota, Moorhead, Minnesota, and Cresco, Iowa. As part of the transaction, we entered into a multi-year supply agreement with Pipeline Foods for certain ingredients used in our consumer products business. We will continue to operate our other North American-based sourcing and supply operations, consisting of sunflower and roasting operations, as well as our European- and U.S.-based organic ingredient operations, which were not part of the sale.
 The sale of the soy and corn business was driven by the portfolio optimization strategy of the Value Creation Plan (see below), which is designed to simplify our business and exit product lines where we are not effectively positioned to drive long-term profitable growth. We intend to initially apply the net proceeds from the transaction to reduce debt, and over time redeploy this capital to further enhance our consumer products and international organic sourcing platforms.
 Additional financial information related to this transaction and the soy and corn business can be found at Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The sale of the soy and corn business was completed after the end of the periods covered by this report and did not affect our results of operations as reported herein for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. Unless otherwise stated, the disclosures in this report reflect our business as it was conducted during the periods covered by this report, without giving effect to the sale of the soy and corn business.
Value Creation Plan 
 On October 7, 2016, we entered into a strategic partnership with Oaktree Capital Management L.P., a private equity investor (together with its affiliates, Oaktree), and, on that date, Oaktree invested $85.0 million through the purchase of cumulative, non-participating Series A Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock) of our wholly-owned subsidiary, SunOpta Foods Inc. (SunOpta Foods).
 Following the strategic partnership, with the assistance of Oaktree, we conducted a thorough review of our operations, management and governance, with the objective of maximizing our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. As a product of this review our management and the Board of Directors implemented a Value Creation Plan built on four pillars: portfolio optimization, operational excellence, go-to-market effectiveness and process sustainability. The Value Creation Plan is a broad-based initiative focused on increasing shareholder value through strategic investments made to the people and assets of the Company to deliver sustained profitable growth. 
 In the first phase of the Value Creation Plan, implemented over 2017 and 2018, we have achieved $30 million of productivity-driven annualized enhancements to adjusted EBITDA. For 2017, the adjusted EBITDA benefits were offset by expenses associated with the Value Creation Plan, including structural investments made in the areas of quality, sales, marketing, operations and engineering resources, and non-structural third-party consulting support, severance and recruiting costs. For 2018, the adjusted EBITDA benefits were offset by a decline in profitability in the frozen fruit platform as a result of sales price reductions to improve competitive positioning, and higher costs including enhancements in sales, service and quality. The Value Creation Plan also calls for increased investment in capital upgrades at several manufacturing facilities to continue to enhance food safety and manufacturing efficiencies and capabilities. 


SUNOPTA INC. | 6 | December 29, 2018 10-K 
-------------+---+-----------------------------


During 2018, the following actions were taken under each of the four pillars of the Value Creation Plan: 
 Portfolio Optimization 
 

Completed an expansion project at our Mexican frozen fruit facility, which
 is expected to drive incremental cost savings, in addition to enhanced
 profitability from the addition of retail bagging capabilities while
 continuing to ensure high quality product and customer service. The increased
 freezing and storage capacity also enables further diversification of the
 fruit varieties sourced from Mexico, which is also expected to provide
 long-term cost advantages. 

Completed commissioning of a second roasting and processing line at our
 organic cocoa facility in the Netherlands. In addition to adding new
 capabilities at the facility, this expansion approximately doubled cocoa
 processing capacity. 

Completed the commissioning of new roasting equipment at our Crookston,
 Minnesota, facility. The new equipment is designed to increase production
 efficiencies and add incremental capacity and roasting capabilities in support
 of demand for on-trend healthy snacks including roasted grains, seeds and
 legumes. 

Progressed with the commissioning of a new oil processing line at our
 Bulgarian sunflower facility, which is expected to drive incremental margins
 through growth and production efficiency. 

Initiated an expansion project at our Allentown, Pennsylvania, aseptic
 beverage facility to add processing and packaging capacity. This investment is
 also designed to add enhanced mixing and processing capabilities that should
 enable us to bring further innovation to the plant-based beverage market. The
 additional processing and filling capacity is also expected to provide
 increased flexibility and cost advantages across our network of aseptic
 plants, while creating needed capacity to continue to grow our organic and
 conventional aseptic beverage offerings. 
Operational Excellence 
 

Continued to advance food safety and quality efforts across our entire
 manufacturing footprint, which has resulted in positive trends in third-party
 audit scores versus the prior year, including an approximately one-third
 reduction in consumer complaints in the Healthy Fruit platform year-over-year.
 

Achieved approximately $20 million of productivity-driven margin
 enhancements in 2018 through our SunOpta 360 continuous improvement
 initiative in the areas of manufacturing, purchasing and supply chain
 management. 

Invested considerable time and resources into pack plan readiness
 initiatives across our California and Mexico fruit facilities in preparation
 for the 2018 strawberry harvest, resulting in high scores for fruit quality
 from enhanced sorting and handling processes, and a rebalancing of inventory
 levels. 

Approved a significant capital enhancement project to bring new automation
 and technology to our California fruit facilities and negotiated a long-term
 lease at the Santa Maria, California, location, which will involve the
 construction by the landlord of an adjacent public cold storage facility.
 These enhancements are designed to lower cost and increase productivity and
 improve quality in the Healthy Fruit platform. 

Continued to improve operational performance across the network of aseptic
 facilities, with overall capacity utilization exceeding 80% in the fourth
 quarter of 2018. 
 Go-To-Market Effectiveness 
 

Achieved commercial wins including the introduction of an innovative
 oat-based, non-dairy beverage into retail and industrial channels, expanded
 distribution of traditional non-dairy products into retail and broadline
 foodservice channels, expanded distribution of everyday broth with a large
 mass retailer, a new agreement to provide private label frozen fruit for a
 specialty retailer, increased orders for private label frozen fruit items
 following a category reset, and increased sales of co-manufactured fruit
 snacks. 

Successfully commercialized over 100 new and refreshed everyday broth and
 frozen fruit products with large mass and traditional retailers. 

 Retained a retail frozen fruit account that was being
 re-bid plus a 14% increase in distribution, and secured a multi- year
 supply agreement with a large foodservice operator for aseptic beverage
 products. 
Maintained a strong pipeline of commercial opportunities
 in Consumer Products, and grew the overall contract book for organic
 ingredients both in Europe and the U.S. versus prior year levels.

 | Completed an enterprise resource planning system implementation project at the Mexican frozen fruit facility. 

 In 2019, we intend to continue to make the necessary strategic business decisions and structural investments that we believe will deliver sustained profitable growth and deliver long-term value. The four pillars of the Value Creation Plan will continue to be framework that guides all of our enterprise-wide objectives. Our focus for 2019 will be in the following two key areas:
 Operational Efficiency and Expansion 
 
 | Continued execution of critical efficiency and expansion projects, including: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | New fruit margin optimization plan, which includes the installation and commissioning of new automation and quality improvement equipment in our California fruit facilities ahead of the 2019 and 2020 strawberry pack seasons, and construction of the new public cold storage facility adjacent to our Santa Maria facility, all designed to drive margin improvement over the 2019 and 2020 crop seasons through lower labor and conversion costs, improved yield, and lower overall storage and freight costs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | Addition of new filling and processing capacity and capabilities at our Allentown beverage facility by the third quarter of 2019. 
o | Opening of a new organic avocado oil facility located in Ethiopia during the second half of 2019. 


 | Through the SunOpta 360 continuous improvement initiative in 2019, we are targeting $10 million of in-year productivity-driven margin enhancement in the areas of manufacturing, purchasing and supply chain, with a significant portion of this target coming from the fruit margin optimization plan. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customer Service, Revenue Growth and Margin Accretive Innovation
 
 | Relentless focus on food safety, quality, and service including continued enhancements to our sales and operations planning processes and capacity planning capabilities.

SUNOPTA INC. | 8 | December 29, 2018 10-K 
-------------+---+-----------------------------


 | Continued growth across the Healthy Fruit, Beverage, and Snack consumer products categories, with a focus on bringing margin-accretive innovation to market to increase the number of value-added products we offer to our customers and targeting approximately 80% capacity utilization inside the aseptic network by the end of 2019, which includes new capacity expected to come online in the third quarter of 2019. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Targeted growth in our Global Ingredients segment, driving our mix of certified organic ingredients to represent over 80% of the sales in the portfolio, and achieving 85% capacity utilization in the recently expanded organic cocoa processing facility by the end of the 2019. 

 The statements we make in this Form 10-K about the expected results of the Value Creation Plan, including the expected improvements in earnings and adjusted EBITDA, as well as future actions to drive growth and deliver long-term value including the fruit margin optimization plan, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K are based on certain factors and assumptions regarding expected growth, results of operations, performance, and business prospects and opportunities. While we consider these assumptions to be reasonable, based on information currently available, they may prove to be incorrect. Forward-looking statements are also subject to certain factors, including risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we currently expect. These factors are more fully described in the Risk Factors section at Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses when assessing the performance of our operations. See footnote (3) to the Consolidated Results of Operations for Fiscal Years 2018 and 2017 table in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations at Item 7 of this Form 10-K for a discussion on the use of this non-GAAP measure and for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA from loss from continuing operations, which we consider to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. 
 Changes in Directors and Executive Officers
 On February 21, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) terminated David Colo as President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Company. In accordance with the terms of Mr. Colos employment agreement, his service as a member of the Board also terminated. On February 22, 2019, Katrina Houde, a member of the Board since December 2000, was appointed to the role of interim CEO. Ms. Houde was interim CEO for the Company from November 11, 2016 through February 6, 2017. Ms. Houde has agreed to serve in this capacity until the Boards election of a new, permanent CEO. The Board has initiated a search process for a permanent CEO. 
 Regretfully, Gregg Tanner, a member of the Board since January 2017, passed away on January 24, 2019.

SUNOPTA INC. | 9 | December 29, 2018 10-K 
-------------+---+-----------------------------


Consumer Products consists of three main commercial platforms: Healthy
 Beverages, Healthy Fruit and Healthy Snacks. Healthy Beverages includes
 aseptic packaged products including non-dairy beverages, broths and teas;
 refrigerated premium juices; and shelf-stable juices and functional waters.
 Healthy Fruit includes IQF fruits for retail; IQF and bulk frozen fruit for
 foodservice; and custom fruit preparations for industrial use. Healthy Snacks
 is focused on fruit snack offerings, and formerly included our flexible
 resealable pouch and nutrition bar product lines, which we exited in 2017.
 
 In 2018, we transferred certain of our specialty ingredient operations from Global Ingredients to the Healthy Beverages platform of Consumer Products. These operations produce liquid bases, including for our non-dairy aseptic beverage operations, as well as spray-dried ingredients 
 Financial information for each reportable segment describing revenues from external customers, a measure of profit or loss, and total assets for the last three fiscal years, as well as financial information about geographic areas for the last three fiscal years, is presented in note 23 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Global Ingredients 
 Operations and Product offeringsGlobal Ingredients
Global Ingredients aggregates our North American and international raw material sourcing and supply operating segments focused on the procurement, processing and sale of specialty and organic grains, seeds, fruits, grain- and cocoa-based ingredients, and other commodities, which are used primarily in applications serving the natural and organic food industry. Its operations are centered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Edina, Minnesota; and Scotts Valley, California. 
 Global Ingredients sources raw materials, ingredients and certain grain-based food products from approximately 65 countries around the world, which include: 
 

Organic fruit- and vegetable-based raw materials and ingredients,
 sweeteners, cocoa, coffees, ancient grains, nuts, seeds and pulses and other
 organic food products. 

Identity preserved (IP), non-GMO and organic seeds and grains including
 soy, corn and sunflower for food applications, with control maintained at
 every stage of production, from seed selection and growing through storage,
 processing and transportation. 

Seed- and grain-based animal feed and pet food products that originate from
 select organic and non-GMO soy, corn, sunflower and other commodities.
 
 Global Ingredients also engages in processing and contract manufacturing services that include: 
 

Seed and grain conditioning services for soy, corn and sunflower. 

Grain milling for corn, with various granulations and batch sizing. 

Cocoa, coffee and sesame seed processing. 

Dry and oil roasting and packaging, including in-shell sunflower and
 sunflower kernels, corn, soy- and legume- based snacks. 

Processing of crude sunflower oil and sunflower cakes. 
 CompetitionGlobal Ingredients 
 Food ingredients are considered niche items often sourced, developed or processed for specific customers or industry segments. Global Ingredients competes with large seed, grain, raw material and specialty ingredient suppliers for customers and competes with other companies active in the international commercial seed, grain and raw material procurement market for supply. Its non-GMO and organic specialty products compete in the smaller niche commercial non-GMO and organic seed, grain and raw material markets. Key to competing in these markets is access to transportation, supply and relationships with producers. Competitors include major food companies with food ingredient divisions, other food ingredient and sourcing companies, and consumer food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources, as well as production and marketing capabilities that are greater than our own. 
 

SUNOPTA INC. | 10 | December 29, 2018 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------


The international organic food industry is very competitive due primarily to the limited worldwide supply of organic raw materials. Global Ingredients competes with worldwide brokers, traders and food processors for the limited supply of organic raw material ingredients. In many cases, it will enter into exclusive arrangements with growers and/or processors of key strategic commodities to control the reliability of its supply chain.
 Distribution, Marketing, and SalesGlobal Ingredients
 As a leading provider of IP, non-GMO and organic, grains, seeds, grain- and cocoa-based ingredients, and other raw materials, Global Ingredients has well established sales and marketing capabilities, including technically oriented sales teams strategically located close to specific geographic sourcing and/or sales regions. Its specialty grains, seeds and other raw materials and ingredients are sold to food manufacturers and producers worldwide, including some of the largest U.S. consumer-packaged food companies. In addition, in our estimation, it maintains one of the largest organic raw material ingredient sourcing and supply networks in the world, working closely to develop and manage global organic supply and link these supplies with diverse customer needs. It also provides procurement and ingredient processing support to the Consumer Products operating segment.
 No customers accounted for more than 10% of revenues from our Global Ingredients segment in 2018.
 SuppliersGlobal Ingredients 
 Global Ingredients has an extensive established IP, organic soy, corn and sunflower grower network in North America, with many relationships existing for over 25 years. It also has a network of growers in Europe, South America, Africa and Asia. Because weather conditions and other factors can limit the availability of raw materials in a specific geography, it continues to focus on expanding production and sourcing capabilities to other parts of the world to ensure supply in years when local production is below normal levels. By diversifying supply, it also has the ability to divert available product based on market demand and customer requirements in order to maximize return.
Organic raw material ingredient suppliers include growers, processors and traders of organic fruit- and vegetable-based ingredients, sweeteners and other food products. The diversity of our supplier base helps to ensure continual supply by providing contra-seasonal solutions to mitigate crop and quality risks. Organic food suppliers are required to meet stringent organic certification requirements equivalent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Organic Program, European Union (EU) standards, or others.
Consumer Products 
 Operations and Product OfferingsConsumer Products 
 Consumer Products provides healthy and organic food products that are primarily consumer-packaged to retailers, foodservice distributors and major global food manufacturers with a variety of branded and private label products. Consumer Products packaged food products are categorized into the following three main commercial platforms: 

 | Healthy Beverages
--+------------------


 | Aseptic beverages including almond, soy, coconut, oat, hemp, rice and other non-dairy beverages, as well as adjacent categories such as broths, teas and nutritional beverages. Specializing in aseptic product offerings, Consumer Products produces a variety of pack sizes, including multi-serve and single-serve formats, all shelf stable with long shelf lives. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Organic and conventional beverage products, including shelf stable and refrigerated juices, specialty beverages, and functional waters. Consumer Products partners with third-party fillers to provide extended shelf life refrigerated packaging formats to its customers.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Our Healthy Beverage platform operates from an east to west network of three aseptic beverage processing facilities and one specialty ingredient facility, as well as co-manufacturing relationships that allow us to minimize distribution costs for our customers, maintain redundant back-up plans, and offer reliable, year- round programs. 


 | Healthy Fruit
--+--------------


 | IQF natural and organic frozen fruits and vegetables, including strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, mango, peppers, broccoli, blends and many other items. Consumer Products produces a variety of packaging formats, including tubs, stand-up pouches, cups and polybags to address the needs of its retail and foodservice customers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Specialty fruit toppings and bases, which are custom formulated to provide unique flavor and texture profiles for a wide range of specialized applications.

 | Our frozen fruit operations consist of five facilities that extend from central Mexico to California, as well as a production facility in Kansas. Strategically our north to south footprint on the west coast allows us to maximize access to supply of fruit over the course of the full growing season, while our operation in the Midwest serves as a lower-cost launching pad to deliver product to the east coast. Our fruit ingredient operations are located in California. 


 | Healthy Snacks
--+---------------


 | Natural and organic fruit-based snacks in bar, twist, rope and bite size shapes, with the ability to add a variety of ingredients. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Our healthy snack platform maintains bi-coastal production which helps to minimize delivery costs to our customers. 

 CompetitionConsumer Products 
 Consumer Products healthy beverage and healthy snack offerings compete with major food manufacturing companies, as well as a number of other regional manufacturers. Its healthy fruit offerings face competition from both branded and private label fruit providers. It faces competition when securing fruit and vegetable raw materials; however, due to the location of its processing facilities, it is able to source these raw materials from a number of growing regions and suppliers. Integrated sourcing through Global Ingredients, which supplies a number of core raw materials, combined with in-house processing and packaging capabilities, provides Consumer Products with a low-cost advantage over many of its competitors. 
 Distribution, Marketing and SalesConsumer Products 
 Consumer Products supplies the private-label retail market, including large retailers and club stores, branded food companies, food manufacturers, foodservice distributors, quick service and casual dining restaurants located principally in North America. In addition, it markets branded food products under SunOpta-controlled brands, including Sunrich® Naturals and Pure Nature. Consumer Products generally conducts its business with customers on the basis of purchase orders and price quotations, without other formal agreements related to minimum or maximum supplies or pricing. 
 In 2018, Starbucks Corporation and two other customers accounted for approximately 18%, 16% and 10%, respectively, of revenues from our Consumer Products operating segment and approximately 10%, 9% and 6%, of our consolidated revenues, respectively. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of revenues from our Consumer Products operating segment in 2018.


SUNOPTA INC. | 12 | December 29, 2018 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------


SuppliersConsumer Products 
 Consumer Products raw materials are subject to the availability of fruit and vegetable supply, which is based on conditions that are beyond our control. Fresh and frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables are sourced directly from a large number of suppliers throughout the U.S., Mexico and globally, or through Global Ingredients. We believe our scale and location close to growing areas makes Consumer Products an attractive customer for fruit growers.
 Consumer Products also relies on its packaging suppliers to ensure delivery of often unique, portable, and convenient consumer packaging formats. In our aseptic packaging facilities, we specialize in the use of Tetra Pak equipment in a variety of pack sizes and also offer a variety of opening types and extended shelf life (ESL) options. Consumer Products also partners with third party fillers to provide ESL and refrigerated packaging formats to its customers. 
 Corporate Services 
 Our corporate headquarters is located in Mississauga, Ontario. In addition, centralized information technology, human resources, operations, research and development, legal and financial shared services groups are located in Edina, Minnesota. Employees of Corporate Services provide support services across the organization including management, finance, legal, operations, business development, information technology, research and development, human resources and administrative functions.
REGULATION 
 We are subject to a wide range of governmental regulations and policies in various countries and regions where we operate, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, throughout the rest of the EU, China and Ethiopia. Outside of the U.S., regulations concerning the sale or characterization of food ingredients vary substantially from country to country, and we take appropriate steps to comply with such regulations. These laws, regulations and policies are implemented, as applicable in each jurisdiction, on the national, federal, state, provincial and local levels. For example, we are affected by laws and regulations related to: seed, fertilizer and pesticides; the purchasing, harvesting, transportation and warehousing of grain and other products; the processing, packaging and sale of food, including wholesale operations; and product labeling and marketing, food safety and food defense. We are also affected by government-sponsored price supports, acreage set aside programs and a number of environmental regulations.
 U.S. Regulations 
 Our activities in the U.S. are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the USDA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the Departments of Commerce and Labor, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies. Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities. 
 USDA National Organic Program and Similar Regulations 
 We currently manufacture and distribute a number of organic products that are subject to the standards set forth in the Organic Foods Production Act and the regulations adopted thereunder by the National Organic Standards Board. In addition, our organic products may be subject to various state regulations. We believe that we are in material compliance with the organic regulations applicable to our business, and we maintain an organic testing and verification process. Generally, organic food products are produced using: 


agricultural management practices intended to promote and enhance ecosystem
 health; 

no genetically engineered seeds or crops, sewage sludge, long-lasting
 pesticides, herbicides or fungicides; and 

food processing practices intended to protect the integrity of the organic
 product and disallow irradiation, genetically modified organisms or synthetic
 preservatives. 
 After becoming certified, organic operations must retain records concerning the production, harvesting, and handling of agricultural products that are to be sold as organic for a period of five years. Any organic operation found to be in violation of the USDA organic regulations is subject to enforcement actions, which can include financial penalties or suspension or revocation of their organic certificate.

Food Safety, Labeling and Packaging Regulations 
 As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA and the FTC. This regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the U.S.
 State and local statutes and regulations may impose additional food safety, labeling, and packaging requirements. For instance, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (commonly referred to as Proposition 65) requires, with a few exceptions, that a specific warning appear on any consumer product sold in California that contains a substance, above certain levels, listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. We believe we are in material compliance with state and local statutes and regulations as they apply to our business. 
Environmental Regulations 
 We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental regulations. Some of the key environmental regulations in the U.S. include, but are not limited to, the following: 


Air quality regulations  air quality is regulated by the EPA and certain
 city/state air pollution control groups. Emission reports are filed annually.
 

Waste treatment/disposal regulations  solid waste is either disposed of by
 a third-party or, in some cases, we have a permit to haul and apply the sludge
 to land. Agreements exist with local city sewer districts to treat waste at
 specified levels of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solids
 (TSS) and other constituents. This can require weekly/monthly reporting as
 well as annual inspection. 

Sewer regulations  we have agreements with the local city sewer districts
 to treat waste at specified limits of BOD and TSS. This requires
 weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. 

Hazardous chemicals regulations  Various reports are filed with local
 city/state emergency response agencies to identify potential hazardous
 chemicals being used in our U.S. facilities. 

Storm water  all U.S. facilities are inspected annually and must comply
 with an approved storm water plan to protect water supplies. 
Employee Safety Regulations 
 We are subject to certain safety regulations, including OSHA regulations. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations applicable to our business. 
 Canadian and Other Non-U.S. Regulations 
 Outside of the U.S., regulations concerning the sale or characterization of food ingredients vary substantially from country to country, and we take appropriate steps to comply with such regulations.
 In Canada, the sale of food is currently regulated under various federal and provincial laws, principally (but not limited to) the Safe Food for Canadians Act (SFCA), the Food and Drugs Act (FADA), the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA), the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act (CFIAA) and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA), along with their supporting regulations. The following is a brief summary of each of these statutes to the extent that they apply or potentially apply to the Company and its operations:
 
Safe Food for Canadians Regulations (SFCR) (under the SFCA)  the
 SFCR came into effect on January 15, 2019 and consolidated 14 sets of existing
 food regulations into a single set of regulations which governs all imported,
 exported, or inter-provincially traded food products. Some provisions of the
 SFCA and SFCR also apply intra-provincially. Notably,SFCR replaced
 the Organic Products Regulations, 2009, the Processed Products
 Regulations and, to the extent that they related to food products, the
 Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act and its supporting regulations.
 Principal elements of the SCFR which may impact the Company include licensing
 requirements, preventative controls, traceability requirements, commodity
 specific requirements, reporting requirements and timelines, an export
 certificate request process, packaging and labeling requirements to ensure
 food safety and prevent false or misleading labeling, regulation of the use of grades and grade
 names, standards of identity and expansion of the certification process for
 organic products, and other requirements.

Timelines for complying with
 the new requirements vary by food, activity, and size of the food business.
 Many requirements came into effect immediately while others allow a grace
 period of up to three years from January 15, 2019 for compliance. 

Food and Drug Regulations (under the FADA)  food and drugs are
 subject to specific regulatory requirements, including composition (such as
 food additives, fortification, and food standards), packaging, labeling,
 advertising and marketing, and licensing requirements. New requirements
 regarding nutrition and ingredient labeling and food color were introduced on
 December 14, 2016. To the extent the new labeling requirements apply to
 products manufactured and sold by the Company, we will have a five-year
 transitional period to adopt them. Amendments dealing with food color
 specifications and the removal of synthetic color certification requirements
 came into effect immediately. 

Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)  the CCPSA provides
 oversight and regulation of consumer products with respect to manufacturers,
 importers, and retailers. It includes, without limitation, the ability to
 require product recalls, mandatory incident reporting, document retention
 requirements, increased fines and penalties, and packaging and labeling
 requirements. While the CCPSA does not apply to food, it does apply to its
 packaging with respect to safety. It is possible that there will be amendments
 introduced to the FADA, to capture the essence of the regulatory oversight
 found in the CCPSA. We have no way of anticipating if and when that may occur.
 

Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act (CFIAA)  the CFIAA grants
 power to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (the CFIA), which is tasked
 with the administration and enforcement of certain Canadian food legislation.
 By virtue of the CFIAA and the SFCA, the CFIA has the power to inspect and, if
 deemed necessary, recall certain products, including fresh fruit and
 vegetables, processed foods and organic foods, if the Minister of Health
 believes that such products pose a risk to the public, animal or plant health.
 

Substance Regulations  Various regulations under CEPA regulate the
 importation and use of certain substances in Canada. For example, prior to the
 importation and use in products, the importer must ensure that all ingredients
 are found on the Domestic Substances List (DSL) maintained by Environment
 and Climate Change Canada. In the event that an ingredient is not found on the
 DSL, then subject to the amount of the substance imported into Canada and used
 in products sold in Canada, a filing may become necessary under the New
 Substances Notification Regulations. 
 We are subject to Dutch and European Commission (EC) regulations and policies. Our European subsidiary, The Organic Corporation (TOC), is involved in the sourcing, supplying, processing, marketing, selling and distribution of organic food products and, as such, is subject to standards for production, labeling and inspection of organic products contained in EC Regulation 2092/91 (and its subsequent amendments). TOC is certified by Skal, the inspection body for the production (trading and selling) of organic products in the Netherlands. Products certified as organic by an EU-recognized inspection body, such as Skal, can be marketed within the entire EU. In addition, under the terms of an equivalency arrangement between the U.S. and the EU, organic operations certified to the USDA organic or EU organic standards may be labeled and sold as organic in both the U.S. and EU. 
 TOC is also affected by general food legislation both at EU and Dutch level relating to product safety and hygiene, among others. TOC is BRC Agents and Brokers certified in the Netherlands and manages a fully computerized system that manages the traceability of each product. In addition, TOC also considers and abides by EU and local legislation with regard to packaging and packaging waste. TOC is also subject to the regulations and policies of the countries outside of the EU in which it operates, including China and Ethiopia. 
 Our frozen fruit processing facility in Mexico is subject to Mexican regulations, including regulations regarding processing, packaging and sales of food products, labor relations and profit-sharing with employees. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development and new product, process and packaging innovation are key priorities of our Company and initiatives are focused on continuous improvement of our existing product portfolios and continuing efforts to improve production processes to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, as well as the development of innovative new products. Innovation is a key pillar for us and a necessity in the natural and organic foods categories. We believe our commitment and proactive approach to new product development and innovation is important to our ability to introduce new higher-margin food and beverage products to the market.

We are also continually looking to develop new value-added products for our customers that leverage our global sourcing platform.
  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
  The nature of a number of our products and processes requires that we create and maintain patents, trade secrets and trademarks. Our policy is to protect our technology, brands and trade names by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of our business in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions, registering trademarks in the U.S., Canada and selected foreign jurisdictions where we sell products, and maintenance of confidentiality agreements with outside parties and employees. 
  Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our products, trade names and technology under U.S. and international patent laws and other intellectual property laws. We believe that we own or have sufficient rights to use all of the proprietary technology, information and trademarks necessary to manufacture and market our products; however, there is always a risk that patent applications relating to our products or technologies will not result in patents being issued, or, if issued, will be later challenged by a third party, or that current or additional patents will not afford protection against competitors with similar technology.
  We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain technologies and processes. However, even with these steps taken, our outside partners and contract manufacturers could gain access to our proprietary technology and confidential information. All employees are required to adhere to internal policies, which are intended to further protect our technologies, processes and trade secrets. 
  PROPERTIES 
  We operate 20 processing facilities in seven U.S. states, as well as Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, and Ethiopia. In addition, we also own and lease a number of office and distribution locations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe, Ethiopia and China, and lease and utilize public warehouses to satisfy our storage needs. We also lease farmland that we sublease to fruit growers. For more details see Item 2. Properties, included elsewhere in this report. 
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS
  We believe that, with respect to both our operations and real property, we are in material compliance with environmental laws at all of our locations.
  EMPLOYEES
  As at December 29, 2018, we had a total of approximately 2,000 full-time employees (December 30, 2017 – 1,800). We also employ up to 2,100 seasonal employees in the U.S. and Mexico during peak fruit seasons each year. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations. 
  AVAILABLE INFORMATION 
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), are available free of charge on our website at www.sunopta.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such information electronically with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and applicable Canadian Securities Administrators (the CSA).
