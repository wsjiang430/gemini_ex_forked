     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
 ﻿
 Overview
 ﻿
 RGP is a global consulting firm that enables rapid business outcomes by bringing together the right people to create transformative change. As a human capital partner for our clients, we specialize in solving today’s most pressing business problems across the enterprise in the areas of Business Transformation, Governance, Risk and Compliance and Technology and Digital Innovation. Our engagements are designed to leverage human connection and collaboration to deliver practical solutions and more impactful results that power our clients, consultants and partners’ success.    ﻿
 RGP was founded in 1996 to help finance executives with operational needs and special projects created by workforce gaps. Our first-to-market, agile human capital model disrupted the professional services industry at a time when traditional talent models prevailed. Today’s new ecosystem for work embraces our founding principle – quickly align the right resources for the work at hand with a premium placed on value, efficiency and ease of use. 
 ﻿
 Our pioneering approach to workforce strategy uniquely positions us to support our clients on their transformation journeys. With more than 3,800 professionals, we annually engage with over 2,400 clients around the world from more than 70 practice offices. We are their partner in delivering on the future of work. Headquartered in Irvine, California, RGP is proud to have served 86 of the Fortune 100.
 ﻿
 Industry Background
 ﻿
 Changing Market for Project- or Initiative-Based Professional Services
 ﻿
 RGP’s services respond to a growing marketplace trend: namely, corporate clients are increasingly choosing to plan for their workforce needs in more flexible ways. We believe the growing trend in the future of work will be project-based and not role based. Permanent headcount is being reduced as clients purposely engage agile talent for project initiatives and transformation work.
 ﻿
 While the market for professional services is broad and fragmented and independent data on the size of the market is not readily available, we believe companies may be more willing to choose alternatives to permanent headcount and traditional professional service providers because of evolving economic competitive pressure and continuing compliance with increases in government-led regulatory requirements. We believe RGP is positioned as a viable alternative to traditional accounting, consulting and law firms in numerous instances because, by using project consultants, companies can:
    
· Strategically access specialized skills, expertise for projects of set duration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Move quickly
--------------


· Blend independent and fresh points of view
--------------------------------------------


· Effectively supplement internal resources
-------------------------------------------


· Increase labor flexibility
----------------------------


· Reduce their overall hiring, training and termination costs
-------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Typically, companies use a variety of alternatives to fill their project needs. Companies outsource entire projects to consulting firms, which provides them access to the expertise of the firm but often entails significant cost and less management control of the project. Companies also supplement their internal resources with employees from the Big Four accounting firms or other traditional professional services firms. Companies use temporary employees from traditional and Internet-based staffing firms, although these employees may be less experienced or less qualified than employees from professional services firms. Finally, some companies rely solely on their own employees who may lack the requisite time, experience or skills.
     Supply of Project Consultants
 ﻿
 Based on discussions with our consultants, we believe the number of professionals seeking to work on an agile basis has historically increased due to a desire for:
· More flexible hours and work arrangements, coupled with a professional culture that offers competitive wages and benefits
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· The ability to learn and contribute in different environments
---------------------------------------------------------------

· Challenging engagements that advance their careers, develop their skills and add to their experience base
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· A work environment that provides a diversity of, and more control over, client engagements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Alternate employment opportunities in regions throughout the world
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The employment alternatives available to professionals may fulfill some, but not all, of an individual’s career objectives. A professional working for a Big Four firm or a consulting firm may receive challenging assignments and training; however, may encounter a career path with less choice and less flexible hours, extensive travel and limited control over work engagements. Alternatively, a professional who works as an independent contractor faces the ongoing task of sourcing assignments and significant administrative burdens, including potential tax and legal issues.
 ﻿
 Resources Global Professionals’ Solution
 ﻿
 We believe RGP is positioned to capitalize on the confluence of the industry trends described above. We believe, based on discussions with our clients, that RGP provides the agility companies desire in today’s competitive and quickly evolving environment. We are able to combine all of the following:
· A relationship-oriented and collaborative approach with our clients
---------------------------------------------------------------------


· A professional dedicated talent acquisition and management team who excel at developing a project-based workforce
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Client service teams with Big Four, consulting and/or industry backgrounds to assess our clients’ project needs and customize solutions to meet those needs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Highly qualified consultants with the requisite expertise, experience and points of view
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Competitive rates on an hourly, rather than project, basis
------------------------------------------------------------


· Significant client control of their projects with effective knowledge transfer and change management
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Resources Global Professionals’ Strategy
 ﻿
 Our Business Strategy
 ﻿
 We are dedicated to serving our clients with highly qualified and experienced talent in support of projects and initiatives in a broad array of functional areas, including:
 ﻿

﻿ | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Business strategy and transformation  Program and project management  Change management  Transaction advisory  Executive search  Human resources  Supply chain  Legal | Finance and accounting  Lease accounting  Revenue recognition  Financial operations  Equity administration and accounting  Tax 
Risk and compliance  Information security and privacy  Internal audit and compliance  Operational risk management | Technology and digital.  Business technology  Data analytics  Robotics process automation 

  Our objective is to build RGP’s reputation as the premier provider of agile consulting services for companies facing transformation, change and compliance challenges. We have developed the following business strategies to achieve our objectives:
    
· Hire and retain highly qualified, experienced consultants. We believe our highly qualified, experienced consultants provide us with a distinct competitive advantage. Therefore, one of our priorities is to continue to attract and retain high-caliber consultants who are committed to solving problems. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified professionals by providing challenging work assignments, competitive compensation and benefits, and continuing professional development and learning opportunities, while offering flexible work schedules and more control over choosing client engagements.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Maintain our distinctive culture. Our corporate culture is the foundation of our business strategy and we believe it has been a significant component of our success. Our senior management, virtually all of whom are Big Four, management consulting and/or Fortune 500 alumni, has created a culture that combines the commitment to quality and the client service focus of a Big Four firm with 4 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


the entrepreneurial energy of an innovative, high-growth company. Our culture continues to evolve to meet the new challenges facing consultants, clients and management and so our original acronym “TIEL” (talent, integrity, enthusiasm and loyalty), representing the traits expected of our people, has evolved. In today’s marketplace, we believe that focus and accountability are key traits that help to strengthen our team and support our ability to provide clients with high-quality services and solutions. Thus, our culture has evolved to “LIFE AT RGP”, representing Loyalty, Integrity, Focus, Enthusiasm, Accountability and Talent. We believe our culture has created a circle of quality; our culture is instrumental to our success in hiring and retaining highly qualified employees who, in turn, attract quality clients. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Build consultative relationships with clients. We emphasize a relationship-oriented approach to business rather than a transaction-oriented or assignment-oriented approach. We believe the professional services experience of our management and consultants enables us to understand the needs of our clients and deliver an integrated, relationship-based approach to meeting those needs. Client relationships and needs are addressed from a client, not office, perspective. We regularly meet with our existing and prospective clients to understand their business issues and help them define their project needs. Once our revenue team helps define the client’s project needs, our talent team identifies consultants with the appropriate skills and experience to meet the client’s objectives. We believe that by establishing relationships with our clients to solve their professional service needs, we are more likely to identify new opportunities to serve them. The strength and depth of our client relationships is demonstrated by two key statistics: 1) during fiscal 2019, 46 of our 50 largest clients in terms of revenue engaged our consultants in more than one practice area and 40 of those largest 50 clients used three or more practice areas; and 2) 44 of our largest 50 clients in fiscal 2013 remained clients in fiscal 2019 while 38 of our largest 50 clients in 2008 were still clients in 2019.

· Build the RGP brand. Our objective is to build RGP’s reputation as the premier provider of agile consulting services for companies facing transformation, change and compliance challenges. We want to be the preferred provider in the future of work. Our primary means of building our brand is by consistently providing high-quality, value-added services to our clients. We have also focused on building a significant referral network through our 2,965 consultants and 931 management and administrative employees working from offices in 20 countries as of May 25, 2019. In addition, we have global, regional and local marketing efforts that reinforce the RGP brand.

 Our Growth Strategy
 ﻿
 Since inception, our growth has been primarily organic rather than via acquisition. We believe we have significant opportunity for continued organic growth in our core business and also to grow opportunistically through strategic acquisitions as the global economy strengthens and economic uncertainties decrease. In both our core and acquired businesses, key elements of our growth strategy include:
· Expanding work from existing clients. A principal component of our strategy is to secure additional work from the clients we have served. We believe, based on discussions with our clients, the amount of revenue we currently receive from many of our clients represents a relatively small percentage of the amount they spend on professional services, and, consistent with historic industry trends, they may continue to increase the amount they spend on these services as the global economy evolves. We believe that by continuing to deliver high-quality services and by further developing our relationships with our clients, we can capture a significantly larger share of our clients’ expenditures for professional services. Near the end of fiscal 2017, we launched our Strategic Client Program to serve a number of our largest clients with dedicated global account teams. We believe this focus enhances our opportunity to develop in-depth knowledge of these clients’ needs and the ability to increase the scope and size of projects with those clients. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Growing our client base. We will continue to focus on attracting new clients. We strive to develop new client relationships primarily by leveraging the significant contact networks of our management and consultants and through referrals from existing clients. We believe we can continue to attract new clients by building our brand name and reputation, supplemented by our global, regional and local marketing efforts. We anticipate our growth efforts this year will focus on identifying strategic target accounts especially in the large and middle market client segments. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Expanding geographically. We have expanded geographically to meet the demand for agile professional services around the world and currently have offices in 20 countries. We believe, based upon our clients’ requests, there are future opportunities to promote growth globally. Consequently, we intend to continue to expand our international presence on a strategic and opportunistic basis. We may also add to our existing domestic office network when our existing clients have a need or if there is a significant new client opportunity. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Strategic acquisitions. Since fiscal 2009, we grew organically, as we had not identified a target acquisition that fit one of our primary acquisition goals: either addressing an identified gap in our geographic presence or in our solution offerings. In fiscal 2018, we identified and acquired -taskforce, Management on Demand AG (“taskforce”) and substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of Accretive Solutions, Inc. (“Accretive”). The acquisitions of taskforce and Accretive satisfied the need to better penetrate the vibrant economic market in Germany and gaps in serving middle market companies in the United States, respectively, while also harmonizing well with RGP’s culture.

· Providing additional professional service offerings. We will continue to develop and consider entry into new professional service offerings. Since our founding, we have diversified our professional service offerings from a primary focus on accounting and finance to other areas in which our clients have significant needs such as human capital; information management; governance, risk and compliance; supply chain management; legal and regulatory services; and corporate advisory, strategic communications and restructuring services. In fiscal 2017, we formed our Integrated Solutions group to identify project opportunities that we can market at an enterprise level with talent, tools and methodologies. This group commercializes projects into solution offerings. Currently, our solutions practice is focused on business technology, data analytics and robotic process automation. When evaluating new solutions offerings to market to current and prospective clients, we consider (among other things) cultural fit, growth potential, profitability, cross-marketing opportunities and competition.

  ﻿
 Consultants
 ﻿
 We believe an important component of our success has been our highly qualified and experienced consultants. As of May 25, 2019, we employed or contracted 2,965 consultants engaged with clients. Our consultants have professional experience in a wide range of industries and functional areas. We provide our consultants with challenging work assignments, competitive compensation and benefits, and continuing professional development and learning opportunities, while offering more choice concerning work schedules and more control over choosing client engagements.
 ﻿
 Almost all of our consultants in the United States are employees of RGP. We typically pay each consultant an hourly rate for each consulting hour worked and for certain administrative time and overtime premiums, and offer benefits, including: paid time off and holidays; a discretionary bonus program; group medical and dental programs, each with an approximate 30-50% contribution by the consultant; a basic term life insurance program; a 401(k) retirement plan with a discretionary company match; and professional development and career training. Typically, a consultant must work a threshold number of hours to be eligible for all of these benefits. In addition, we offer our consultants the ability to participate in the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which enables them to purchase shares of the Company’s stock at a discount. We intend to maintain competitive compensation and benefit programs. To a much lesser extent, we utilize a “bench model” for consultants with specialized in-demand skills and experience. These consultants are paid a weekly salary rather than for each consulting hour worked and have bonus eligibility based upon utilization.
 ﻿
 Internationally, our consultants are a blend of employees and independent contractors. Independent contractor arrangements are more common abroad than in the United States due to the labor laws, tax regulations and customs of the international markets we serve. A few international practices also utilize the partial “bench model” described above.
 ﻿
 Clients
 ﻿
 We provide our services and solutions to a diverse client base in a broad range of industries. In fiscal 2019, we served over 2,400 clients from offices located in 20 countries. Our revenues are not concentrated with any particular client. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the 2019, 2018 an 2017 fiscal years, and in fiscal 2019, our 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 15% of our revenues.    ﻿ Operations
 ﻿
 We generally provide our professional services to clients at a local level, with the oversight of our market vice presidents and consultation of our corporate management team. The vice presidents and client development directors in each market are responsible for initiating client relationships, ensuring client satisfaction throughout engagements, coordinating services for clients on a national and international platform and maintaining client relationships post-engagement. Throughout this process, the corporate management team and regional vice presidents are available to consult with the vice presidents with respect to client services. Market revenue leadership and their teams identify, develop and close new and existing client opportunities, often working in a coordinated effort with other markets on multi-national/multi-location proposals.  
 ﻿
 Market revenue leadership works closely with our regionalized talent management team, who are responsible for identifying, hiring and cultivating a sustainable relationship with seasoned professionals fitting the RGP profile of client needs. Our consultant recruiting efforts are regionally or nationally based, depending upon the skill set required; talent management handles both the identification and hiring of consultants specifically skilled to perform client projects as well as monitoring the satisfaction of consultants during and post-completion of assignments. Talent focuses on getting the right talent in the right place at the right time. 
 ﻿
 We believe a substantial portion of the buying decisions made by our clients are made on a local or regional basis and that our offices most often compete with other professional services providers on a local or regional basis. As the marketplace for professional services has evolved, we continue to believe our local market leaders are in the best position to understand the local and regional outsourced professional services market. However, the complexity of relationships with many of our multinational clients also dictates that in some circumstances a hybrid model, bringing the best of both locally driven relationships as well as global focus, is important for employee and client satisfaction.

﻿
 For projects requiring intimate knowledge and thought leadership on particular client concerns, our integrated solutions group consists of individuals with requisite skills and tools to work with clients.
 ﻿
 We believe our ability to deliver professional services successfully to clients is dependent on our leaders in the field working together as a collegial and collaborative team, often working jointly on client projects. To build a sense of team effort and increase camaraderie among our leaders, we have a program for field personnel that awards annual incentives based on specific agreed-to goals focused on the performance of the individual and potential reward tied to the performance of the Company. We also share across the Company the best and most effective practices of our highest achieving offices and use this as an introductory tool with new vice presidents and directors. New leadership also spend time in other markets, partnering with experienced sales and recruiting personnel to understand, among many skills, how best to serve current clients, expand our presence with prospects and identify and recruit highly qualified consultants. This allows the veteran leadership to share their success stories, foster the culture of the Company with new vice presidents and directors and review specific client and consultant development programs. We believe these team-based practices enable us to better serve clients who prefer a centrally organized service approach.
 ﻿
 From our corporate headquarters in Irvine, California, we provide centralized administrative, marketing, finance, HR, IT, legal and real estate support. Our financial reporting is also centralized in our corporate service center. This center handles invoicing, accounts payable and collections, and administers HR services including employee compensation and benefits administration for North American offices. We also have a business support operations center in our Utrecht, Netherlands office to provide centralized finance, HR, IT, payroll and legal support to our European offices. We share our Salesforce software platform world-wide, providing a common database of identified opportunities, prospective new clients, and existing client proposals for additional projects. In addition, in North America, we have a corporate networked IT platform with centralized financial reporting capabilities and a front office client management system. These centralized functions minimize the administrative burdens on our office management and allow them to spend more time focused on client and consultant development.
 ﻿
 Business Development
 ﻿
 Our business development initiatives are composed of:
 ﻿

· local and global initiatives focused on existing clients and target companies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· national and international targeting efforts focused on multinational companies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· brand marketing activities
----------------------------


· national and local advertising and direct mail programs
---------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Our business development efforts are driven by the networking and sales efforts of our management. While local senior management focus on market-related activities, they are also part of the regional, national and international sales efforts, especially when the client is part of a multinational entity. In certain markets, sales efforts are also enhanced by management professionals focused solely on business development efforts on a market and national basis based on firm-wide and industry-focused initiatives. These business development professionals, teamed with the vice-presidents and client service teams, are responsible for initiating and fostering relationships with the senior management and decision makers of our targeted client companies. During fiscal 2018, we completed our implementation of software from Salesforce.com on a world-wide basis, to serve as a tool to enhance our local and worldwide business development efforts. 
 ﻿
 We believe our national marketing efforts have been effective in generating incremental revenues from existing clients and developing new client relationships. Our brand marketing initiatives help develop RGP’s image in the markets we serve. Our brand is reinforced by our professionally designed website, print, and online advertising, direct marketing, seminars, initiative-oriented brochures, social media and public relations efforts. We believe our branding initiatives, coupled with our high-quality client service, help to differentiate us from our competitors and to establish RGP as a credible and reputable global professional services firm.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 We operate in a competitive, fragmented market and compete for clients and consultants with a variety of organizations that offer similar services. Our principal competitors include:
· consulting firms
------------------


· local, regional, national and international accounting and other traditional professional services firms
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· independent contractors
-------------------------


· traditional and Internet-based staffing firms
-----------------------------------------------

 
 
7


 


· the in-house or former in-house resources of our clients
----------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 We compete for clients on the basis of the quality of professionals, the knowledge base they possess, the timely availability of professionals with requisite skills, the scope and price of services, and the geographic reach of services. We believe our attractive value proposition, consisting of our highly qualified consultants, relationship-oriented approach and professional culture, enables us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Although we believe we compete favorably with our competitors, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition than we do.
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 As of May 25, 2019, we had 3,896 employees, including 931 management and administrative employees and 2,965 consultants. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
