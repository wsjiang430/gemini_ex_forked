Item 1. Business
Mobile Satellite Services Business
Globalstar, Inc. (“we,” “us” or the “Company”) provides Mobile Satellite Services (“MSS”) including voice and data communications services in addition to wholesale capacity services through its global satellite network. We offer these services over our network of in-orbit satellites and our active ground stations (“gateways”), which we refer to collectively as the Globalstar System. In addition to supporting Internet of Things ("IoT") data transmissions in a variety of applications, we provide reliable connectivity in areas not served or underserved by terrestrial wireless and wireline networks and in circumstances where terrestrial networks are not operational due to natural or man-made disasters. By providing wireless communications services across the globe, we meet our customers' increasing desire for connectivity. 
Business Strategy
Our competitive advantages are leveraged through a strategy that relies primarily on four pillars to drive increasing shareholder value: wholesale satellite capacity, terrestrial spectrum, IoT and legacy services. The four pillars are outlined below.
Wholesale Satellite Capacity
Wholesale satellite capacity services include satellite network access and related services using our satellite spectrum and network of satellites and gateways. 
In September 2022, Apple Inc. (“Partner”) announced new satellite-enabled services for certain of its products (the “Services”). We are the satellite operator for the Services pursuant to the agreement (the “Service Agreement”) and certain related ancillary agreements (such agreements, together with the Service Agreement, as each is amended from time to time, the “Service Agreements”). The Services constitute the service which was previously described and disclosed as the Terms Agreement. 
Since execution of the Service Agreements in 2020 and prior to the commencement of the Services in 2022, the parties completed several milestones, including (i) a feasibility phase, (ii) material upgrades to our ground network, (iii) construction of 10 new gateways around the world, (iv) the successful launch of the ground spare satellite, and (v) rigorous in-field system 
testing. The Service Agreements generally require us to allocate network capacity to support the Services, and Partner to enable Band 53/n53 for use in cellular-enabled devices designated by Partner for use with the Services. 
Partner made the Services available to its customers beginning in November 2022 (the “Service Launch”). In consideration for the Services provided by us, Partner will make payments to us under the Service Agreements, such as a recurring service fee, payments relating to certain Service-related operating expenses and capital expenditures, including under the satellite procurement agreement with Macdonald, Dettwiler and Associates Corporation ("MDA" or, the "Vendor"), and potential bonus payments subject to satisfaction of certain licensing, service and related criteria.
In addition to the services provided under the Service Agreements, we intend to continue to develop wholesale customer opportunities over our retained satellite capacity (discussed below) for IoT and other initiatives.
We retain 15% of network capacity to support our existing and future Duplex, SPOT and IoT subscribers. This capacity can support a substantial increase in our own subscriber base, particularly following recent and planned investments in our space and ground segments. The retained satellite capacity can be used by us directly or through additional wholesale arrangements.
Terrestrial Spectrum
We have terrestrial licenses in 11 countries resulting in approximately 10.0 billion MHz-POPs (megahertz of our spectrum authority in each country multiplied by a total population of approximately 797 million over the covered area). Prospective spectrum partners, including cable companies, legacy or upstart wireless carriers, system integrators, utilities and other infrastructure operators, all benefit from access to uniform and increasingly “borderless” spectrum working across geographies. Our expanding portfolio of terrestrial spectrum represents a substantial opportunity for us. Given our senior status as the incumbent operator in the Big LEO band, we believe that our valuable assets include our extensive portfolio of domestic and international licenses to access the globally harmonized spectrum that is essential to all of the services that we offer today and into the future. The Service Agreements significantly enhance the device ecosystem for Band 53/n53.
IoT
Satellite IoT connectivity has become more critical to a growing number of sectors and use cases. We plan to continue to evolve and develop our IoT initiatives. In June 2022, we introduced the Realm Enablement Suite, an innovative portfolio of satellite asset tracking hardware and software solutions featuring a powerful application enablement platform for processing smart data at the edge, which improves processing time and reliability in remote locations. With Realm, partners can accelerate new solutions to market with smart applications that generate an advanced level of telematics data. The Realm Enablement Suite includes Integrity 150, the first solar-powered, deployment-ready satellite asset tracking device with an application enablement platform; ST150M, a satellite modem module that drastically simplifies product development; and the Realm application enablement platform, which will offer tools and an extensive library for quickly accessing and developing smart applications at the edge for vertical-specific solutions. 
We also continue to expand deployments that support environmentally friendly initiatives, including remote monitoring of fluid levels and tanks, which replaces the need for motor vehicles to access these assets, as well as asset monitoring solutions for solar lighting and other renewable energy sources. 
In 2023, we expect to introduce a two-way commercial IoT product which would significantly expand our opportunities in the IoT Market because this technology would have capabilities that include both tracking as well as command control.
Legacy Services
We remain committed to our legacy satellite business and serving our current subscriber base while offering future innovations in MSS. Our existing Duplex and SPOT customers are expected to benefit from expanded capacity through additional ground infrastructure and satellites which improve service levels.
Communications Products and Services
We currently provide the following communications services: 
•two-way voice communication and data transmissions via our GSP-1600 and GSP-1700 phone ("Duplex");
•one-way or two-way communication and data transmissions using mobile devices, including our SPOT family of products, such as SPOT X ®, SPOT Gen4TM and SPOT Trace®, that transmit messages and the location of the device ("SPOT");
•one-way data transmissions using a mobile or fixed device that transmits its location and other information to a central monitoring station, including our commercial IoT products, such as our battery- and solar-powered SmartOne, STX-3, ST100, ST-150 and Integrity 150 ("Commercial IoT"); 
•satellite network access and related services utilizing our satellite spectrum and network of satellites and gateways ("Wholesale Capacity Services"); and 
•engineering and other communication services using our MSS and terrestrial spectrum licenses ("Engineering and Other").

We compete aggressively on price. We offer a range of price-competitive products to the industrial, governmental and consumer markets. We expect to retain our position as a cost-effective, high-quality leader in the MSS industry. 
As technological advancements are made, we continue to explore opportunities to develop new products and provide new services over our network to meet the needs of our existing and prospective customers. We have pursued and continue to pursue initiatives that we expect will expand our satellite communications business and even more intensively utilize our network assets. These initiatives include evaluating our product and service offerings in light of the shift in demand across the MSS industry from full Duplex voice and data services to direct-to-handset and IoT-enabled devices. Integrated with this assessment is the development of a two-way reference design module to expand our Commercial IoT offerings, which is among our other current initiatives. In recent years, we have considered the value of maintaining our second-generation Duplex services in light of alternative uses for our capacity, including uses under the Service Agreements. As previously disclosed, in September 2022, we abandoned our second-generation Duplex assets, including gateway property, prepaid licenses and royalties, and inventory. We will continue to support first-generation Duplex services, including voice communications and data transmissions using our satellite phones and data modems. 
Globalstar System
Satellite Network
Our constellation of Low Earth Orbit ("LEO") satellites includes second-generation satellites and certain first-generation satellites. We designed our satellite network so that at least one satellite is visible from any point on the Earth's surface between the latitudes 70° north and 70° south. We designed our second-generation satellites to last twice as long in space, have 40% greater capacity and be built at a significantly lower cost compared to our first-generation satellites. 
Our goal is to provide service levels and call or message success rates equal to or better than our MSS competitors so our products and services are attractive to potential customers. We believe that our system outperforms geostationary (“GEO”) satellites used by some of our competitors. GEO satellite signals must travel approximately 42,000 additional miles on average, which introduces considerable delay and signal degradation to GEO calls. 
In February 2022, we entered into a satellite procurement agreement with MDA pursuant to which we expect to acquire 17 satellites that will replenish our existing constellation and ensure long-term continuity of our mobile satellite services. We are acquiring the satellites to provide continuous satellite services to Partner under the Service Agreements, as well as services to our current and future customers. We have committed to purchase these new satellites for a total contract price of $327.0 million and have the option to purchase additional satellites at a lower per unit cost, subject to certain conditions. The technical specifications and design of these new satellites are similar to our current second-generation satellites. Rocket Lab USA, Inc. is the Vendor’s satellite bus subcontractor. The satellite procurement agreement requires the Vendor to deliver 17 new satellites by 2025, all of which are expected to be launched by the end of 2025. Under the Service Agreements, subject to certain terms and conditions, Partner has agreed to make service payments equal to 95% of the approved capital expenditures under the satellite procurement agreement (to be paid on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the satellites) and certain other costs incurred for the new satellites, as adjusted based on certain provisions, beginning with the Phase 2 Service Period.
In June 2022, we successfully launched our on-ground spare second-generation satellite. This satellite is expected to remain as an in-orbit spare and will only be raised to its operational orbit at a future date if needed.
Ground Network
Our satellites communicate with a network of gateways, each of which serves an area of approximately 700,000 to 1,000,000 square miles. A gateway must be within line-of-sight of a satellite and the satellite must be within line-of-sight of the subscriber to provide services. We have positioned our gateways to provide coverage over most of the Earth's land and human population and continue to evaluate and expand our gateway footprint to optimize coverage.
Each of our gateways has multiple antennas that communicate with our satellites and pass communications seamlessly between antenna beams and satellites as the satellites traverse the gateways, thereby reflecting the signals from our users' terminals to our gateways. Once a satellite acquires a signal from an end-user, the Globalstar System authenticates the user and establishes the voice or data channel to complete the call to the public switched telephone network (“PSTN”), a cellular or another wireless network or the internet for data communications including Commercial IoT. Over the past few years, we have procured and installed new antennas at our new and existing gateways around the world.
We believe that our network's design enables faster and more cost-effective system maintenance and upgrades because the system's software and much of its hardware are located on the ground. Our multiple gateways allow us to reconfigure our system quickly to extend another gateway's coverage to make up for lost coverage from a disabled gateway or to handle increased call capacity resulting from surges in demand.
Our ground network includes our ground equipment, which uses patented CDMA technology to permit communication to multiple satellites. Our system architecture provides full frequency re-use. This maximizes satellite diversity (which maximizes quality) and network capacity as we can reuse the assigned spectrum in every satellite beam in every satellite. In addition, we have developed a proprietary technology for our SPOT and Commercial IoT services.
Throughout the past few years, we have commenced leases for additional gateways around the world. We also made significant progress on our initiative to upgrade certain gateway equipment, including new antennas and appliques, to improve our ability to pursue significant new opportunities to deploy our network assets as technologies and customer needs evolve and to ensure our network performance continues to excel as these opportunities increase demand on our capacity.
Customers

For our subscriber driven revenue, the specialized needs of our global customers span many industries. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 769,000 subscribers worldwide, principally within the following markets: recreation and personal; government; public safety and disaster relief; oil and gas; maritime and fishing; natural resources, mining and forestry; construction; utilities; animal tracking; and transportation. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, during the first quarter of 2022, we disconnected satellite services to gateways in Russia that were operated by an independent gateway operator. Accordingly, approximately 25,000 subscribers that previously received satellite services through these gateways were removed from our subscriber count. Our subscriber count does not include our Partner's subscribers. Our system is able to offer our customers cost-effective communications solutions completely independent of cellular coverage. Although traditional users of wireless telephony and broadband data services have access to these services in developed locations, our customers often operate, travel and/or live in remote regions or regions with under-developed telecommunications infrastructure where these services are not readily available or are not provided on a reliable basis. Our top revenue-generating markets in the United States and Canada are government (including federal, state and local agencies), public safety and disaster relief, oil and gas, recreation and personal telecommunications. In recent years, the number of Commercial IoT devices on our network has increased significantly. 
In addition to our subscribers, we also provide services to our Partner under the Service Agreements as discussed above in the Wholesale Capacity Services section. Our FCC license allows us to provide service over our network to up to 250 million users in the United States. Our subscriber count does not include our Partner's subscribers. 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, our Partner under the Service Agreements was responsible for 24% of our revenue with no other customer responsible for more than 10% of our revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no one customer was responsible for more than 10% of our revenue. The loss of a large customer, such as our Partner under the Service Agreements, could have an adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Duplex Two-Way Voice and Data Products

Mobile Voice and Data Satellite Communications Services and Equipment

We provide mobile voice and data services to a variety of commercial, government and individual customers for remote business continuity, recreational usage, safety, emergency preparedness and response and other applications. We offer our services for use only with equipment designed to work on our network.

SPOT Consumer Retail Products

The SPOT product family has been used to initiate over 9,000 rescues since its launch in 2007. SPOT delivers affordable and reliable satellite-based connectivity and real-time GPS tracking to hundreds of thousands of users, completely independent of cellular coverage. 
We differentiate ourselves from other MSS providers by offering affordable, high-utility mobile satellite products that appeal to both businesses and the mainstream consumer market. We believe that we are the only vertically-integrated mobile satellite company. Our vertical integration results in decreased pre-production costs, greater quality assurance and shorter time to market for our retail consumer products. 

We currently sell SPOT Gen4TM, SPOT X® and SPOT Trace®. SPOT Gen4TM offers enhanced tracking features and is also water resistant. The product enables users to transmit predefined messages to a specific preprogrammed email address, phone or data device, including requests for assistance and “SOS” messages in the event of an emergency. SPOT X® is a two-way SPOT device with keyboard functionality allowing subscribers to send and receive SMS messages. SPOT X® connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth® wireless technology through the SPOT X® app to send and receive satellite messages. SPOT Trace® is a cost-effective, anti-theft and asset-tracking device. SPOT Trace® ensures cars, motorcycles, boats, ATVs, snowmobiles and other valuable assets are where they need to be, notifying owners via email or text anytime movement is detected, using 100% satellite technology to provide location-based messaging and emergency notification for on or off the grid communications.
We target our SPOT devices to recreational and commercial markets that require personal tracking, emergency location and messaging solutions that operate beyond the reach of terrestrial wireless and wireline coverage. Using our network and web-based mapping software, these devices provide consumers with the ability to trace a path geographically or map the location of individuals or equipment. SPOT products and services are available through our product distribution channels and our direct e-commerce website. 

Product Distribution

We distribute and sell our SPOT products through a variety of distribution channels. We have distribution relationships with a number of "Big Box" retailers and other similar distribution channels, including Amazon, Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's, Camping World, REI, Sportsman's Warehouse, Academy and West Marine. We also sell SPOT products and services directly using our existing sales force and through our direct e-commerce website, www.findmespot.com.
Commercial IoT Transmission Products

Commercial IoT service is currently a one-way data service from an IoT device over the Globalstar System that can be used to track and monitor assets. Our subscribers use our Commercial IoT devices for a host of applications: to track assets, such as cargo containers and rail cars; to monitor utility meters; and to monitor oil and gas assets. At the heart of the Commercial IoT service is a demodulator and RF interface, called an appliqué, which is located at a gateway and an application server in our facilities. The appliqué-equipped gateways provide coverage over vast areas of the globe. The small size of the IoT devices makes them attractive for use in tracking asset shipments, monitoring unattended remote assets, trailer tracking and mobile security. We provide Commercial IoT services to customers operating in a variety of industries, including primarily government, transportation, construction, agriculture and forestry. Current users include various governmental agencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Forest Service and U.K. Ministry of Defence, as well as other organizations, such as BP, Shell and The Salvation Army.

We designed our Commercial IoT service to address demand in the market for a small and cost-effective solution for sending data, such as geographic coordinates, from assets or individuals in remote locations to a central monitoring station. Customers realize an efficiency advantage from tracking assets on a single global system as compared to several regional systems. 

Satellite Transmitter Modules and Chips
We offer small satellite transmitter modules, such as the STX-3, ST-150 and ST100, and chips, such as our proprietary ASIC, which enable an integrator’s products to access our network. We have sales arrangements with major resellers to market our IoT services, including some value-added resellers that integrate our modules into their proprietary solutions designed to meet certain specialized niche market applications. The STX3 provides additional opportunities to integrate satellite connectivity into products used for vehicle and asset tracking, remote data reporting and data logger reporting that have limited size requirements. Affordable pricing, low power consumption and its small size make the STX3 a highly efficient device ready for integration in a wide variety of applications. The ST100, or ST100 Satellite Transmitter, is a small, lightweight and low power IoT board with embedded antennas. The ST100 offers a customizable approach to new commercial IoT product innovations and can be used by simply adding power, a mechanical enclosure and configuring the settings within the device firmware. For more advanced technical requirements, third parties can write their own firmware on the ST100 and utilize Bluetooth® wireless technology and the serial connector to expand the use of the board and integrate it with other devices or hardware. The ASIC provides a single chip one-way solution that can be embedded in a customer's own solution.
SmartOne Asset Managers
We also offer complete products that utilize the STX-3 transmitter module and our ASIC chip. Our Commercial IoT units, including the enterprise-grade SmartOne family of asset-ready tracking units, are used worldwide by industrial, commercial and government customers. These products provide cost-effective, low-power, ultra-reliable, secure monitoring that help solve a variety of security applications and asset tracking challenges. Partnering with existing third party technology providers, we are developing IoT products to connect existing and new users and accelerate deployment of an expanded Globalstar IoT product suite. 
We also offer SmartOne Solar™, which is solar-powered and supports similar functionality to our SmartOne suite of products without the need to recharge batteries or line power the device over an expected life of up to ten years. These features will result in a longer field life than existing devices. Solar-powered devices also take advantage of our network's ability to support multiple billions of daily transmissions. The SmartOne Solar™ also has unparalleled safety and environmental certifications including ATEX, IECEx, North America (NEC & CEC), IP68/69K, and HERO. 
Realm Enablement Suite
The Realm Enablement Suite is an innovative portfolio of satellite asset tracking hardware and software solutions featuring a powerful application enablement platform for processing smart data at the edge. With Realm, partners can accelerate new solutions to market with smart applications that generate an advanced level of telematics data.

Future Developments
We have other initiatives underway to expand our Commercial IoT offerings, including the development of a two-way reference design module, which we expect will complete our lineup of competitive product offerings. Operating on our Realm Enablement Suite, the two-way module and finished product will provide the fundamentals to effectively pursue sales opportunities with carriers, enterprises, large resellers, system integrators, and any party looking to extend their business models with satellite connectivity.
Product Distribution

The reseller channel for Commercial IoT equipment and service is comprised primarily of value-added resellers and commercial communications equipment companies that retain and bill clients directly, outside of our billing system. Many of our resellers specialize in niche vertical markets where high-use customers are concentrated. We expect that demand for our Commercial IoT products and services will increase as more applications are developed and deployed that utilize our technology.
Wholesale Capacity Services
Wholesale satellite capacity services include satellite network access and related services using our satellite spectrum and network of satellites and gateways. 
Engineering and Other 
We provide engineering services to assist certain customers in developing new applications to operate on our network and to enhance our ground network. These services include hardware and software designs to develop specific applications operating over our network, as well as the installation of gateways and antennas.
Spectrum and Regulatory Structure

We benefit from a worldwide allocation of radio frequency spectrum in the international radio frequency tables administered by the International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”). Access to this globally harmonized spectrum enables us to design satellites, networks and terrestrial infrastructure enhancements more cost effectively because the products and services can be deployed and sold worldwide. In addition, this broad spectrum assignment enhances our ability to capitalize on existing and emerging wireless and broadband applications.
Satellite Network

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") has authorized us to operate between 1610-1618.725 MHz for “Uplink” communications from mobile earth terminals to our satellites and between 2483.5-2500 MHz for “Downlink” communications from our satellites to our mobile earth terminals. The FCC has also authorized us to operate our domestic gateways with our first and second-generation satellites in the 5091-5250 and 6875-7055 MHz bands. 
We licensed and registered our second-generation satellites in France. We also obtained all authorizations necessary from the FCC to operate our domestic gateways with our second-generation satellites. In accordance with our authorization to operate the second-generation satellites, we completed the enhancements to the existing gateway operations in Aussaguel, France to include satellite operations and control functions. We have redundant satellite operation control facilities in Covington, Louisiana, Milpitas, California and Aussaguel, France.
During 2020, our French authorizations to provide MSS and operate the gateway in Aussaguel, France were renewed for an additional 10-year term. We have also filed applications in both Germany and France to operate a substantially larger satellite constellation than we have today; these applications have been accepted by the ITU and have an established date.
Terrestrial Authority for Globalstar's Licensed 2.4 GHz Spectrum
In December 2016, the FCC unanimously adopted a Report and Order permitting us to seek modification of our existing MSS licenses to provide terrestrial broadband services over 11.5 MHz of our licensed Mobile Satellite Services spectrum at 2483.5 to 2495 MHz throughout the United States of America and its Territories. In August 2017, the FCC modified Globalstar's MSS licenses, granting us authority to provide terrestrial broadband services over the 11.5 MHz portion of our licensed MSS spectrum. Specifically, the FCC modified our space station authorization and our blanket mobile earth station license to permit a terrestrial network using 11.5 MHz of our licensed mobile-satellite service spectrum. 
In December 2018, we successfully completed the Third Generation Partnership Project (“3GPP”) standardization process for the 11.5 MHz of our licensed MSS spectrum terrestrially authorized by the FCC. The 3GPP designated the band as Band 53. Additionally, in March 2020, we announced that the 3GPP approved the 5G variant of our Band 53, which is known as n53. This new band class provides a pathway for our terrestrial spectrum to be integrated into handset and infrastructure ecosystems. Additional follow-on 3GPP specifications and approvals are expected in the future. During 2019, we executed a spectrum manager lease agreement with Nokia in order to permit Nokia to utilize Band 53 within its equipment domestically and have such equipment type-certified for sale and deployment. 
In February 2021, Qualcomm Technologies announced its new Snapdragon X65 modem-RF System, which includes support for Band n53. By having global 5G band support for n53 in Qualcomm Technologies’ 5G solutions, our potential device ecosystem expands significantly to include the most popular smartphones, laptops, tablets, automated equipment and other IoT modules. In September 2022, we announced the Service Agreements, which require Partner to enable Band 53/n53 for use in cellular-enabled devices designated by Partner for use with the Services, subject to certain terms and conditions; we believe this inclusion significantly enhances the device ecosystem for Band 53/n53. 
We believe our MSS spectrum position provides potential for harmonized terrestrial authority across many international regulatory domains and have been seeking approvals in various international jurisdictions. To date, we have received additional terrestrial authorizations in various countries including Brazil, Canada and South Africa, among others. We expect this global effort to continue for the foreseeable future while we seek additional terrestrial approvals to internationally harmonize our S-band spectrum across the entire 16.5 MHz authority for terrestrial mobile broadband services.
We expect our terrestrial authority will allow future partners to develop high-density dedicated networks using the TD-LTE and 5G protocols for private networks as well as the densification of cellular networks. We believe that our offering has competitive advantages over other conventional commercial spectrum allocations. Such other allocations must meet minimum population coverage requirements, which effectively prohibit the exclusive use of most carrier spectrum for dedicated small cell deployments. In addition, low frequency carrier spectrum is not physically well suited to high-density small cell topologies, and mmWave spectrum is subject to range and attenuation limitations. We believe that our licensed 2.4 GHz band holds physical, regulatory and ecosystem qualities that distinguishes it from other current and anticipated allocations, and that it is well positioned to balance favorable range, capacity and attenuation characteristics. 
Industry

We compete in the MSS sector of the global communications industry. MSS operators provide voice and data services using a network of one or more satellites and associated ground facilities. Mobile satellite services are usually complementary to other forms of terrestrial communications services and infrastructure and are intended to allow for connectivity beyond the reach of cellular. Customers typically use satellite voice and data communications in situations where existing terrestrial wireline and wireless communications networks are impaired or do not exist.

Government organizations, military, natural disaster aid associations, event-driven response agencies and corporate security teams across the world depend on mobile and fixed voice and data communications services on a regular basis. Businesses with global operations require communications services when operating in remote locations. MSS users span the forestry, maritime, government, oil and gas, mining, leisure, emergency services, construction and transportation sectors, among others. 

Over the past two decades, the global MSS market has experienced significant growth. Increasingly, better-tailored, improved technology products and services are creating new channels of demand. Growth in demand for mobile satellite services is driven by the declining cost of these services, the diminishing size and lower cost of the devices, as well as heightened demand by governments, businesses and individuals for ubiquitous global voice and data coverage. Growth in mobile satellite data services is driven by the rollout of new applications requiring higher bandwidth, as well as low-cost data collection and asset-tracking devices and technological improvements permitting integration of mobile satellite services over smartphones and other Wi-Fi enabled devices.
Communications industry sectors that are relevant to our business include:

•MSS, which provide customers with connectivity to mobile and fixed devices using a network of satellites and ground facilities;
•fixed satellite services, which use geostationary satellites to provide customers with voice and broadband communications links between fixed points on the earth's surface; and
•terrestrial services, which use a terrestrial network to provide wireless or wireline connectivity and are complementary to satellite services.
Additionally, the emergence of satellite to cellular technology has brought with it an increased number of satellite providers working in collaboration with mobile providers to extend smart phone messaging capability. 
Within the major satellite sectors, fixed and MSS operators differ significantly from each other. Fixed satellite services providers, such as Intelsat Ltd., Eutelsat Communications and SES S.A., and aperture terminal companies, such as Hughes and Gilat Satellite Networks, are characterized by large, often stationary or "fixed," ground terminals that send and receive high-bandwidth signals to and from the satellite network for video and high speed data customers and international telephone markets. On the other hand, MSS providers, such as Globalstar, ORBCOMM, Inmarsat PLC (“Inmarsat”) and Iridium Communications Inc. (“Iridium”), focus more on voice and/or data services (including data services which track the location of remote assets such as shipping containers), where mobility or small-sized terminals are essential. As mobile satellite terminals begin to offer higher bandwidth to support a wider range of applications, we expect MSS operators will increasingly compete with fixed satellite services operators.

LEO systems reduce transmission delay compared to a geosynchronous system due to the shorter distance signals have to travel. In addition, LEO systems are less prone to signal blockage and, consequently, we believe provide a better overall quality of service.
We are also a provider of licensed wireless spectrum for use in terrestrial networks. As more and more devices are connected wirelessly and as their applications increase in bandwidth intensity, more terrestrial spectrum is required. In the United States, there are a number of other current licensed spectrum providers, including Anterix, Nextwave and Terrastar as well as various other licensed spectrum holders. We also provide an alternative to unlicensed spectrum used with Wi-Fi or lightly licensed spectrum like CBRS. 
Each spectrum band is unique due to its propagation or ecosystem development; accordingly, some bands suit needs that others may not. Our spectrum band offers partners an international resource that has a robust and growing ecosystem.
Competition

The global communications industry is highly competitive. We currently face substantial competition from other service providers that offer a range of mobile and fixed communications options. Our most direct competition comes from other global MSS providers. Our largest global competitors are ORBCOMM, Inmarsat and Iridium. We compete primarily on the basis of coverage, quality, portability and pricing of services and products. In recent years, advancements in technology have also encouraged non-traditional companies to enter the market.

Inmarsat owns and operates a fleet of geostationary satellites. Due to its multiple-satellite geostationary system, Inmarsat's coverage area extends to and covers most bodies of water more completely than our system. Accordingly, Inmarsat is the leading provider of satellite communications services to the maritime sector. Inmarsat also offers global land-based and aeronautical communications services. We compete with Inmarsat in several key areas, particularly in our maritime markets. Inmarsat markets mobile handsets designed to compete with both Iridium’s mobile handset service and our GSP-1700 handset service.

Iridium owns and operates a fleet of low earth orbit satellites. Iridium provides voice and data communications to businesses, the United States government as well as foreign governments, non-governmental organizations and consumers. Iridium markets products and services that are similar to those marketed by us. Additionally, Garmin's inReach devices provide two-way tracking with SOS capabilities, Honeywell Global Tracking has a personal tracking unit that enables a smartphone with satellite tracking and messaging capabilities and Somewear has a satellite hotspot; these products work on Iridium's satellite network.
ORBCOMM owns and operates a fleet of low earth orbit satellites. ORBCOMM primarily provides asset tracking, monitoring and control solutions for its customers in the IoT market, which directly compete with our IoT products and services. 

We compete with regional mobile satellite communications services in several markets. In these cases, our competitors serve customers who require regional, not global, mobile voice and data services, so our competitors present a viable alternative to our services in certain markets. All of these competitors operate geostationary satellites. Our principal regional MSS competitor in the Middle East and Africa is Thuraya. 
Our direct to device service also faces competition from newly announced service providers, including SpaceX, Iridium and a number of new market entrants. While our service is currently the most robust service providing satellite capabilities to smartphones, other satellite service providers are expected to provide similar satellite services in the near-term to competitive smartphone devices.

In some of our markets, such as rural telephony, we compete directly or indirectly with very small aperture terminal (“VSAT”) operators that offer communications services through private networks using very small aperture terminals or hybrid systems to target business users. VSAT operators have become increasingly competitive due to technological advances that have resulted in smaller, more flexible and less expensive terminals.

We compete indirectly with terrestrial wireline (“landline”) and wireless communications networks. We provide service in areas that are inadequately covered by these ground systems. To the extent that terrestrial communications companies invest in underdeveloped areas, we will face increased competition in those areas. 

Our SPOT products compete indirectly with Personal Locator Beacons (“PLBs”). A variety of manufacturers offer PLBs to industry specifications. 

Our industry has significant barriers to entry, including the cost and difficulty associated with obtaining spectrum licenses and successfully building and launching a satellite and ground network. In addition to cost, there is a significant amount of lead-time associated with obtaining the required licenses, designing and building the satellite constellation and synchronizing the network technology. 

For terrestrial spectrum opportunities, our primary competition is other licensed and unlicensed spectrum alternatives and, to a lesser extent, lightly licensed bands. Anterix, a licensed spectrum holder, is also a successful competitor for use cases that require low data over longer distances. We may be able to address certain of these use cases with spectrum provided by our satellite network.
Governmental Regulations 
Please refer to Item 1A: Risk Factors - "Risks Related to Government Regulations" for further discussion of the impact of governmental regulations on our business.
United States International Traffic in Arms Regulations and United States Export Administration Regulations
The United States International Traffic in Arms regulations under the United States Arms Export Control Act authorize the President of the United States to control the export and import of articles and services that can be used in the production of arms. The President has delegated this authority to the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. United States Export Administration Regulations enforced by the United States Bureau of Industry and Security, as well as regulations enforced by the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control regulate the export of certain products, services, and associated technical data. Among other things, these regulations limit the ability to export certain articles and related technical data to certain nations. Some information involved in the performance of our operations falls within the scope of these regulations. As a result, we may have to obtain an export authorization or restrict access to that information by international companies that are our vendors or service providers. We have received and expect to continue to receive export licenses for covered articles and technical data shared with approved parties outside the United States. We also are subject to restrictions related to transactions with persons subject to United States or foreign sanctions. These regulations, enforced by the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control, limit our ability to offer services and equipment to certain parties or in certain areas.
Environmental Matters

We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety (including those governing the management, storage and disposal of hazardous materials). Some of our operations require continuous power supply. As a result, current and historical operations at our ground facilities, including our gateways, include storing fuels and batteries, which may contain hazardous materials, to power back-up generators. As an owner or operator of property and in connection with our current and historical operations, we could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of violations of or in connection with liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.
Foreign Operations

We supply services and products to a number of foreign customers. Although most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to currency risk for sales in Canada, Europe, Brazil and various other countries. In 2022, approximately 27% of our sales were generated in foreign countries, which generally are denominated in local currencies. See Note 2: Revenue in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding revenue by country. For more information about our exposure to risks related to foreign locations, see Item 1A: Risk Factors - "We face special risks by doing business in international markets and developing markets, including currency and expropriation risks, which could increase our costs or reduce our revenues in these areas."
Intellectual Property

We hold various U.S. and foreign patents and patents pending that expire between 2023 and 2039. These patents cover many aspects of our satellite system, our global network and our user terminals. In recent years, we have reduced our foreign filings and decided to allow some previously granted foreign patents to lapse based on (a) the relative significance of the patent, (b) our assessment of the likelihood that someone would infringe in the foreign country, and (c) the probability that we could or would enforce the patent in light of the expense of filing and maintaining the foreign patent which, in some countries, is quite substantial. We continue to maintain all of the patents in the United States, Canada and Europe that we believe are important to our business. Our intellectual property is pledged as security for our obligations under our credit facility agreement we entered into in 2019 (the "2019 Facility Agreement").
Human Capital

As of December 31, 2022, we had 332 employees in fourteen countries around the world; 22 of our employees were located in Brazil and subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. We are an equal opportunity employer and comply with labor and employment laws in all of the countries in which we operate.
Our compensation and benefit packages are designed to attract and retain employees and were developed using market research. We attract employees through various platforms, such as online job portals, recruiters, in-person job fairs, local universities and employee referrals. Salaries are competitive and based on job position, physical location, experience and skills. In addition to base salary, certain employees participate in longer-term incentive programs, which include awards of stock-based compensation. Our benefits packages include, but are not limited to, health insurance, a retirement plan, an employee stock purchase plan, flexible spending accounts, life and accidental injury insurance, long- and short-term disability, and paid time off for holidays, vacation, personal choice holidays, sick time and parental leave.
We also encourage training and development through Globalstar University, which is an online platform that hosts a variety of training programs ranging from leadership and management programs to technical, on the job training. Employee engagement is also important for us, and includes an interactive wellness program, corporate communications and employee surveys. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is part of our worldwide culture, which our employees confirmed in our most recent employee survey as "Diversity and Inclusion" continues to be one of the highest rated culture categories.
In response to COVID-19 mitigation measures, we remain focused on the health and safety of our employees. We continue to support hybrid working arrangements and accommodate flexible work schedules, as needed.
Seasonality

Usage on the network and, to some extent, sales are subject to seasonal and situational changes. April through October are typically our peak months for usage-based service revenues and equipment sales. We also experience event-driven revenue fluctuations in our business. Most notably, emergencies, natural disasters and other sizable projects where satellite-based communications devices are the only solution may generate an increase in revenue. In the consumer area, SPOT devices sales are influenced by outdoor and leisure activity opportunities, as well as our holiday promotions.
Services and Equipment

Sales of services accounted for approximately 89%, 85% and 88% of our total revenues for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We also sell the related voice and data equipment to our customers, which accounted for approximately 11%, 15% and 12% of our total revenues for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Global Chip Shortage
In recent years, the global chip shortage has negatively impacted our manufacturing processes, including causing delays in and increased costs of sourcing certain component parts. We have mitigated some of the impact of these shortages through strategic changes in our manufacturing process and supply chain.
