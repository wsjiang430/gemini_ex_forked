FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
The information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our capital needs, business plans and expectations. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding our planned business, availability of funds, government regulations, common share prices, operating costs, capital costs, our ability to deploy our planned business and generate revenues and other factors. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may", "will", "should", "expect", "plan", "intend", "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "predict", "potential" or "continue", the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by our management in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors they believe are appropriate in the circumstances. Actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks outlined below, and, from time to time, in other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”). These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update these statements, or disclose any difference between its actual results and those reflected in these statements. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
Overview
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 16, 1977, as “Turinco, Inc.” to engage in any legal undertaking. On July 24, 2006, the Company’s name was changed from Turinco, Inc. to Arvana Inc. to reflect the acquisition of Arvana Networks, Inc., a telecommunications business. We discontinued efforts related to our telecommunications business as of December 31, 2009. We have since been in the process of seeking other business opportunities.
 
Our office is located at 299 S. Main Street, 13th Floor, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, and our telephone number is (801) 232-7395. Our registered agent is JAD Communications LLC., 5209 West Gowan Road, Las Vegas, Nevada 89130.

Company
 
On March 17, 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with CaiE Food Partnership Ltd. (“CaiE”) for the purpose of acquiring CaiE as a wholly-owned subsidiary. CaiE is in the business of manufacturing and distributing fresh Dim Sum food products from a facility based in Sparks, Nevada.

The MOU anticipates that the Company will issue a fully diluted sixty-seven percent (67%) interest in its common stock to acquire CaiE. The MOU further provides that CaiE lend the Company fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) on a convertible basis prior to the consummation of the transaction. The anticipated transaction will require the Company to convert existing debt into shares of its common stock, increase the number of authorized common shares, elect a new board of directors and change its name to reflect the new business. Due to delays in obtaining CaiE’s business and financial information, the terms of the MOU are likely to change in the event the parties determine to move forward with the transaction. The delays have caused CaiE to make additional loans to the Company. CaiE has loaned the Company $113,400 as of the filing date of this report.
 
In the event that the Company does not complete the acquisition of CaiE, its intention will be to identify and evaluate alternative business opportunities that might be a good match for the Company. We will not be able to develop any business opportunities without additional financing. Management is actively pursuing financing to maintain operations.
 
Selection of a Business
 
Should the Company not acquire CaiE, it will not restrict consideration to any particular business or industry segment, and could consider opportunities in finance, brokerage, insurance, transportation, communications, research and development, biotechnology, service, natural resources, manufacturing or high-technology. Management recognizes that the Company’s inadequate financial resources limit the scope and number of business venture candidates that might otherwise be available.
 
The decision to participate in a specific business opportunity will be made upon management’s analysis of the quality of management and personnel (if any), the prospects for new products or marketing concepts, the merit of technological changes and other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze through the application of any objective criteria. We also understand that the historical operations of a specific venture may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for future operations due to any changes in management, marketing, operations, products and services, or other changes.
 
We will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained. Further, we understand that any new opportunity would present risks to our shareholders. Risks could include the effectiveness of management, the success of marketing of products or services, and whether the opportunity has realized net income from operations. Many more risks may not be adequately identified prior to the selection of a specific opportunity, and our shareholders must, therefore, depend on the ability of management to identify and evaluate such risks.
 
Acquisition of Business
 
We may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, franchise or licensing agreement with another entity or may purchase the stock or assets of an existing business. On the consummation of any given transaction, it is likely that present management and shareholders would no longer control the Company. Further, management may resign and be replaced by new officers and directors without a vote of the Company’s shareholders. Securities issued in any reorganization would be issued in reliance on exemptions from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of any transaction, the Company may agree to register securities either at the time the transaction is consummated, or at a specified time thereafter. The issuance of additional securities and potential sale into our trading market could have a depressive effect on our stock price.

While the actual terms of a transaction to which the Company may be a party cannot be predicted, it may be expected that the parties to the business transaction would find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure an acquisition in a so called “tax-free” reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”). However, in order to obtain tax-free treatment under the Code, it may be necessary for the owners of the acquired business or business opportunity to own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such event, the shareholders of the Company would retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Any merger or acquisition effected by the Company can be expected to have a substantial dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by the Company’s present shareholders.
 
Operation of Business after Acquisition
 
The Company's operation following a merger with or acquisition of a business would be dependent on the nature of the business and the interest acquired. We are unable to determine at this time whether the Company would be in control of the business or whether present management would be in control of the Company following any acquisition. We could expect that any future business would present various challenges that cannot be predicted at the present time.
 
Competition
 
Whatever the business opportunity is that we do ultimately acquire or develop, we are almost certain to be involved in intense competition with other business entities, many of which will have a competitive edge over us by virtue of their stronger financial resources and prior business experience.
Employees
 
The Company currently has one part time employee. Ruairidh Campbell, our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and one of our directors who manages the Company. The Company looks to Mr. Campbell for his entrepreneurial skills and talents. Management uses consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary and does not plan to engage any full-time employees in the near future.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements and Labor Contracts
 
The Company owns no patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, or royalty agreements. We are not subject to any labor contracts.
 
Governmental and Environmental Regulation 
 
General
 
The Company cannot at this time anticipate the government regulations, if any, to which the Company may be subject following a merger or acquisition. However, we can be certain that the conduct of any business subjects us to environmental, public health and safety, land use, trade, or other governmental regulations and state or local taxation. In selecting a business in which to acquire an interest, management would endeavor to ascertain the effects of such government regulation on a prospective business opportunity. In certain circumstances, however, such as the acquisition of an interest in a new or start-up business activity, it may not be possible to predict with any degree of accuracy the impact of government regulation.The Company believes that it is currently in compliance in all material respects with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements that affect its business. Further, we believe that compliance with such applicable laws, rules, regulations and requirements does not impose a material impediment on our ability to conduct business.
