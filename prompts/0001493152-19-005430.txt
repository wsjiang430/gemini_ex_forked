------------+---------

 
Global Diversified Marketing Group, Inc. (the “Company”) is a food and snack manufacturer, marketer and distributor through its subsidiary Global Diversified Holdings, Inc (“GDHI”) in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The Company operates through snacks segments offering Italian Wafers, French Madeleines, Wafer Pralines, Mini Honey Wafers, Puffs Bites, Coconut Rolls and other wholesome snacks.
 
The Company (through its subsidiary GDHI) is a successfully operating snack and gourmet food company. The Company travels the world and attends global food trade shows to look for unique products and snacks. When it locates exciting and suitable products, the Company will enter into a non-exclusive manufacturing contract with a factory to produce the product under the Company’s own trademarked brands for sale in the United States and global markets.
 
The products are chosen based on the trend of consumer interests as garnered by the Company as well as certain requests from the buyers as to what they are looking for to add to their product offerings. If the product sales are not within the projected targets, then the Company will discontinue that product. To date, the Company has not discontinued a product for failure to meet its projected targets.
 
Although the Company does not have long-term contracts with any of retail chains, it has been supplying its current chain retail stores for several years. In the food industry, there are no on-going contracts. A buyer will place a Purchase Order with the Company and the Company will deliver on it. If the product does well, the buyer typically will continue to reorder the product. Typical payment schedule for the Company’s products are net 30 day terms.
 
Vending Operations
 
In addition to placing its products with large retail chains, the Company places its products in vending machines throughout the United States. These vending machines are located in malls, service stations and schools. The Company works with vending companies that have, in the aggregate, more than 100,000 machines nationwide. The Company supplies vending companies with product. The Company works directly with some vending companies and with others through its food service distributors. The broker pre-sells the products and the distributor services the accounts. When the distributor services the accounts, the distributor buys product directly from the Company and pays on a net 10 day term.
Products and Trademarked Brands
 
The Company currently has five trademark brands. Each brand encompasses numerous SKUs which are brought to market from time to time. The Company produces its products primarily on an “on request” basis from its retail chain buyers for sale through such chains.

Retail Chain Buyers
 
The primary distribution of the Company’s products are through several major retail chains. The Company works with the buyers who place orders for the Company’s products. The retail chain represented by these buyers will then distribute the product to its retail outlets.
Marketing
 
The Company’s products appeal to a wide range of consumers, including most all age brackets. The young snackers, classified as those being between the ages of 18-34, tend to consume more snacks then average adult but the gourmet foods reach the broader adult market. The senior market tends to reduce snacks and gourmet foods.
 
The Company sells its products throughout the United States and global markets to buyers which typically represent recognized large retail chain stores. The products are then distributed by the chains to their local outlets. The Company locates and develops snacks and gourmet foods to brand under its trademarks based on feedback and demand. The Company works closely with buyers to determine what products to locate and produce and to supply to the buyers.
 
The Company intends to continue to develop additional gourmet foods and snack products under its own trademarked brands expanding the Company’s offering portfolio. Management believes that the acquisition of small brands that have regional success and adding these to the Company’s national distribution can immediately generate additional revenue streams for the Company.
 
Product Activations 
 
The Company will set up blind taste test at neutral locations, in stores, malls and snack shops to let consumers sample products and to determine consumer preferences, and most importantly, find out the basis for those preferences. Is it the taste, the packaging, or Company image? This will also serve as an opportunity for the Company to highlight its products directly to the consumer.
 
The Company anticipates that it will primarily target teens and adults up to age 65. The primary target market is “Young Snackers” that are 18-34 years old and tend to eat more snacks than other age groups. The trend of snacks between meals is especially strong with millennial and younger Americans. A quarter of American millennials, age 23 to 40, report eating four or more times a day, compared to just 10% of Gen X and 9% of Baby Boomers. The Company believes that the senior age bracket (over 65) is not a strong snack market.
 
Competition
 
The snack food industry in the United States is very competitive, particularly in the savory and salty snack segment. Snacks are satisfying consumer cravings around the world with the snacking business growing to US$3.4 billion globally in 2017. In the United States, a study conducted by the Packaging Strategies reported that snacks account for 51% of all food sales, and 92% of adults in the US have snacked within the last 24 hours.
 
The snack industry has experienced an increase demand for “healthy” snacks. In the United States, companies are finding success in the “snackable” fruit and vegetable category, such as grapes or baby carrots. These portable-produce items are then repackaged into individual serving such as dried fruit and nut snack packs, small fresh smoothies and fruit cups. Consumers has shown a very positive response to this snacking sub-category making it a billion dollar industry with an compounded annual growth rate of 10% between 2012 and 2016.
 
A challenge facing entrants is snack and gourmet food market is the dominance of leading snack food producers, particularly the industry leader PepsiCo. Large producers experience a high degree of brand and consumer loyalty and possess sufficient capital to invest in extensive advertising and promotions to obtain a greater market share. Furthermore, companies such as PepsiCo benefit from higher profit margins when compared with small- to medium-sized operators, enabling them to lower their product prices and to engage in price-based competition with competitors. Multinational producers also experience lower per-unit costs due to economies of scale and scope.
