Strategic Vision
 
Specificity, Inc. is a technology company with 2 core missions:
 

1) | First, we endeavor to deliver the latest digital marketing technology to companies of all sizes making them nationally, regionally, and locally competitive. In this capacity, we come to the table already vertically integrated and capable of executing any size campaign flawlessly. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Secondarily, Specificity is a tech incubator. We identify technology-based marketing solutions, take an equity share position in return for utilizing our internal resources to complete the buildout of technology-based solutions, and then using our marketing prowess to draw clients to these businesses. We have the internal personnel to successfully complete these projects and our marketing capabilities will deliver lower advertising costs to launch new projects making growth faster to attain.

Digital Marketing
 
As a digital marketing agency, Specificity is an early adopter of innovative digital marketing tools. Our team keeps our clients ahead of the technology curve instead of chasing it. Our ability to identify audiences in granular ways other tech companies have given up on, positions us well to deliver better results at lower costs. By delivering ads to more targeted audiences, our clients enjoy the benefit of focusing 100% of their digital spend on audiences that make sense for their products and services. While the large social media/tech companies are eliminating or limiting access to targeting tools, we continue to add better targeting tools all the time.
 
As digital marketing continues to evolve, Specificity finds itself with an incredibly unique opportunity. While the large tech companies and social media firms are removing targeting mechanisms from their platforms, businesses are waking up to the fact that more targeted audiences lower their CPA (cost per acquisition) and dramatically improve their ROI. As each day goes by, business owners have learned that the less targeted their campaigns are the more money and time they waste. Reaching the audiences they were easily able to reach just a few years back is made more expensive with the removal of targeting mechanisms. It is all done in the name of political correctness, but it is obvious to most, that their true motivation is to drive ad spend up to drive revenue for themselves.
 
All of these events put Specificity in a great position to acquire new clients in mass. Our capital raise will in large part be used to grow our sales team in two regions initially and then expand quickly thereafter. The two regions we are starting with are the Tampa and New England markets and will be targeting clients with revenues between$5,000,000 and $25,000,000. The revenue target speaks to both retainer and retention. We know that clients with this type of revenue typically have internal marketing teams that are more suited to understand analytics and can more easily track results. When this is the case, these clients stay longer and are more active in running the campaign making it far easier to produce new creative and get it approved more quickly, a critical component for campaign optimization.
 
We also know that clients with these revenues spend on average, $5,100 per month. This is important because this retainer level ensures profitability after accounting for sales expense and the overhead required to execute a campaign. While Specificity welcomes smaller businesses as well as larger businesses, targeting these size companies through our sales efforts will ensure both long-term retention and profitability. Both Tampa and the New England region have a plethora of companies that fall into this category. Tampa has 9,991 companies with annual revenue between 5 and 25 million. (insert breakdown provided here for Tampa as well as New England here) The New England market boasts far more in our targeted range.

In addition to being home to many companies we seek to engage, there is another reason these two regions were selected. Kevin Frisbie is an investor in Specificity and possesses a long track record for running highly productive sales teams. He will be recruiting, training and managing the sales team in the New England market and clearly has a vested interest in its success. Our CEO, Jason Wood, similarly possesses a long track record for managing sales teams and will be recruiting, training and managing the team in the Tampa market. Between the two of these seasoned pros, growing their respective markets should be accomplished in the timeline provided in the projections.
 
While we project strong revenue growth in 2022, our other mission is to buildout internal capacity to facilitate growth. A portion of our capital raise will go towards that end. Having a well-trained staff in place will not only allow for the expeditious on-boarding of new clients but will also go a long way in retaining clients we bring on. Strong client retention is foundational to long-term success in our business. We have already automated much of what we do so the length of time required to properly train people is drastically reduced.
 
Tech Incubator
 
In the digital marketing space, there are numerous opportunities for project completion. Men and women across the country have great ideas but not the resources to finish their projects. Our model is simple, once we identify these opportunities, we will negotiate an equity share position in return for using our resources to complete the buildout. These resources include our website design team, programmers, graphic designers, digital marketers and management.
 
 Due to the nature of what we do, we welcome these projects with both the ability to help complete them and the ability to market them. We can identify the audience most likely to use them and then aggressively advertise to that audience. Our goal in doing so is to spin them off into their own company and then take our profit when the time is right.
 
PickPocket
 
This model is being proven now. Specificity acquired, then completed a digital marketing platform called PickPocket. It offers its users location-based device ID extraction in a self-serve platform wherein users can define the parameters of their own campaign. It aims to compete with the marketing mechanisms in social media companies. Just as they are removing targeting capabilities, PickPocket will hit the market offering very granular targeting. Users on PickPocket are in total control of their campaign and can dictate spend level, locations to target, and the duration of the campaign. Forty-eight hours after the campaign is complete, PickPocket clients get an email containing detailed analytics, including foot traffic attribution reporting. This reporting tells the client how many people physically visited their location out of all the device IDs that were marketed to during the campaign. The report also contains tracking for impressions, clicks, form fills, and ecommerce conversions where appropriate. We have launched PickPocket and will be fully capitalizing the marketing through fiscal year 2023.
 
The Investor Center
 
Another project we have brought in-house is the Investor Center. This is an online portal allowing investors to completely customize their own user experience. They can choose what news feeds to populate on their home screen, which stocks to follow, what industries to track, which OTC companies to follow, which companies seeking private investment to keep track of and much, much more. This service is subscription based.
 
In addition to providing users with a customized experience, The Investor Center brings together companies seeking investment with brokers, investors and private equity firms. Paid advertising on the platform is available for companies seeking to garner investor attention or for brokers seeking to offer their services to investors. There are many revenue streams available, and our sales team will investigate every available opportunity.
 
Currently, we have completed the website buildout with full functionality and will be launching very soon. The future goal for the investor center is to utilize a full stack developer to turn this into a native app for iPhone and Android.

Going Concern
 
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $4,344,532 and used cash of $2,036,911 in operating activities. The Companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and/or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third parties.
 
In order to further implement its business plan and satisfy its working capital requirements, the Company will need to raise additional capital. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise additional equity or debt financing at acceptable terms, if at all.
 
There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Competition
 
Specificity operates in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. We compete for business and talent with the operating subsidiaries of large global holding companies such as Omnicom Group Inc., Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., WPP plc, Publicis Groupe SA, Dentsu Inc. and Havas SA, as well as with numerous independent agencies that operate in multiple markets. Our Partner Firms also face competition from consultancies, like Accenture and Deloitte, tech platforms, media companies and other services firms that offer related services. We must compete with all of these other companies to maintain and grow existing client relationships and to obtain new clients and assignments.
 
We compete at this level by providing clients with innovative marketing solutions that leverage the full power of data, technology, and superior creativity. Specificity also benefits from cooperation among its entrepreneurial Partner Firms, which enables Specificity to service the full range of global clients varied marketing needs through custom integrated solutions. Additionally, Specificitys maintenance of separate, independent operating companies enables Specificity to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest by representing competing clients across its network.
 
Clients
 
Specificity plans to solicit entities generating annual revenues between $5,000,000 and $25,000,000 in revenues. In evaluating potential clients we consider long term retention with an average of $5,100 per month in services. This will ensure that long term-term retention and profitability for the Company. Our general geographic focus currently is in the Tampa Bay and New England areas. We will expand scope of our geographic focus in the future as we develop success in our primary markets. Due to the nature of our business and the relative size of certain contracts, which are entered into in the ordinary course of business, the loss of any single significant customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In future periods, we will continue to focus on diversifying our revenue by increasing the number of our customer contracts and seeking out partnerships that will allow us to increase our customer reach beyond our limited reach.
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We believe we will come to rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and other rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We will protect our intellectual property rights in a number of ways including entering into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, customers, consultants and partners in an attempt to control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary technology and other information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology.
 
U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing in the United States the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents. Our patents, including our pending patents, if granted, may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights that may be granted in those issued and pending patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing those patents. Therefore, the exact benefits of our issued patents and, if issued, our pending patents and the other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.

Seasonality
 
Our business is not seasonal. However, our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, due to revenues earned on contracts, the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter. Because a portion of our expenses, such as personnel and facilities costs, are fixed in the short term, successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 20 full-time employees. We periodically engage additional consultants and employ temporary or full-time employees as needed. Potential employees possessing the unique qualifications required are readily available for both part-time and full-time employment. The primary method of soliciting personnel is through recruiting resources directly utilizing all known sources including electronic databases, public forums, and personal networks of friends and former co-workers.
 
We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to offer market competitive compensation packages to attract and retain highly skilled, highly motivated and disciplined managerial, technical, sales and support personnel. In addition, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements are in place with many of our customer, employees and consultants and such agreements are included our policies and procedures. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
