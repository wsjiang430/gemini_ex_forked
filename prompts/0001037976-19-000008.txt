OUR HISTORY
We began to establish our network of services across the globe through the 1999 merger of the Jones Lang Wootton companies ("JLW", founded in England in 1783) with LaSalle Partners Incorporated ("LaSalle Partners", founded in the United States in 1968 and incorporated in 1997). We have grown our business by expanding our client base and the range of our services and products, both organically and through a series of mergers and acquisitions. Our extensive global platform and in-depth knowledge of local real estate markets enable us to serve as a single-source provider of solutions for the full spectrum of our clients' real estate needs.
Over the last ten years, we completed nearly 90 strategic acquisitions as part of our global growth strategy. These acquisitions have given us additional share in key geographical markets, expanded our capabilities in certain service offerings and further broadened the global platform we make available to our clients.
For information on recent acquisitions, refer to Note 4, Business Combinations, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8.

Our service lines, and the services we provide within them, include:
1. Leasing
Agency Leasing executes leasing programs, including marketing, on behalf of investors, developers, property companies and public entities to secure tenants and negotiate leases with terms that reflect our clients' best interests. In 2018, we completed approximately 16,100 agency leasing transactions representing 250 million square feet of space. Our agency leasing fees are typically based on a percentage of the value of the lease revenue commitment for executed leases, although in some cases they are based on a dollar amount per square foot leased.
Tenant Representation establishes strategic alliances with clients which may include helping them: defining space requirements; identifying suitable alternatives; recommending appropriate occupancy solutions; negotiating lease and ownership terms with landlords; and reducing real estate costs by analyzing, structuring, and negotiating business and economic incentives. We employ a multi-disciplinary approach to develop occupancy strategies linked to our clients' core business objectives.
Tenant Representation realizes revenue on a negotiated fee basis which, in many cases, landlords are responsible for paying. Fees sometimes reflect performance measures related to targets that we and our clients establish prior to engagement or, in the case of strategic alliances, at future annual intervals. We use quantitative and qualitative measurements to assess performance relative to these goals, and we may be awarded incentive fees for superior performance. In 2018, we completed approximately 21,400 tenant representation transactions representing 821 million square feet of space.
2. Capital Markets
Capital Markets includes property sales and acquisitions, real estate financings, private equity placements, portfolio advisory activities, and corporate finance advice and execution. We provide these services for substantially all types of properties, including hotel and hospitality assets. In the U.S., we are an approved HUD/Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac commercial multifamily lender and loan servicer. Real Estate Investment Banking includes sourcing capital, both equity and debt, derivatives structuring, and other traditional investment banking services designed to assist investor and corporate clients in maximizing the value of their real estate. To meet client demands for marketing real estate assets internationally and investing outside of their home markets, our Capital Markets teams combine local market knowledge with our access to global capital sources to provide superior execution in raising capital for real estate transactions. By researching, developing and introducing innovative new financial products and strategies, Capital Markets is also integral to the business development efforts of our other businesses.
Clients typically compensate Capital Markets units on the basis of the value of transactions we complete or securities we place. In certain circumstances, we receive retainer fees for portfolio advisory services. Real Estate Investment Banking fees are generally transaction-specific and conditioned upon the successful completion of the transaction. During 2018, we provided capital markets services for approximately $179 billion of client transactions.
3. Property & Facility Management
Property Management provides on-site management services to real estate owners for office, industrial, retail, multifamily residential and specialty properties. We seek to leverage our market share and buying power to deliver superior service and value to our clients. We provide services through our own employees or through contracts with third-party providers, striving to maintain high levels of occupancy and tenant satisfaction while lowering clients' property operating costs. As of December 31, 2018, we provided on-site property management services for properties totaling approximately 3.2 billion square feet.
We typically provide property management services through an on-site general manager and staff. Our general managers are responsible for day-to-day property management activities, client satisfaction and financial results. We support them with regional supervisory teams and central resources in such areas as training, technical and environmental services, accounting, marketing, and human resources. We are generally compensated based upon a percentage of cash collections on behalf of our clients or square footage managed; however, in some cases, management agreements provide for incentive compensation relating to operating expense reductions, gross revenue or occupancy objectives, or tenant satisfaction levels. Consistent with industry custom, management contract terms typically range from one to three years, although some contracts can be terminated at will at any time following a short notice period, usually 30 to 120 days, as is typical in the industry.
8

Integrated Facilities Management ("IFM") provides comprehensive portfolio and facility management services to corporations and institutions that outsource the management of the real estate they occupy. Through digital investments, procurement and supply chain management expertise, as well as process discipline across a globally integrated platform, we provide services at a lower cost than our clients could otherwise achieve themselves while also enhancing the human experience of their employees and other end-users of their space. Technology is the backbone of our IFM delivery, leveraging advanced products such as cloud-based work order management and advanced business intelligence tools that empower clients in their space optimization assessments. Our IFM services focus on the day-to-day management of client locations and include, but are not limited to, repairs and maintenance, call center operations, security and landscaping delivered through an integrated model. Our extended delivery team includes our own personnel as well as third-party vendors and subcontractors. Facilities under management cover all real estate asset classes, including corporate headquarters, distribution facilities, hospitals, research & development facilities, data centers and industrial complexes. As of December 31, 2018, IFM managed approximately 1.4 billion square feet of real estate for our clients.
Our target clients typically have large portfolios (usually over one million square feet) that offer significant opportunities to reduce costs and improve service delivery. The competitive trends of globalization, outsourcing and off-shoring have prompted many of these clients to demand consistent service delivery worldwide and a single point of contact from their real estate service providers. We tailor our service delivery to individual client needs by combining our large global platform with substantial local expertise. Depending on client needs, our IFM personnel, either alone or as partners with other business units or third-party providers, frequently also provide services beyond core IFM including portfolio planning, agency leasing, tenant representation, acquisition, finance, disposition, development management, energy and sustainability services, digital solutions and land advisory services.
IFM contracts are typically structured to include reimbursement for costs of client-dedicated personnel and third-party vendors and subcontractors in addition to a base fee and a performance bonus. Performance bonus compensation results from achievement of quantitative performance measures and regularly scheduled client satisfaction surveys. IFM agreements are typically three to seven years in duration, although most contracts can be terminated at will by the client upon a short notice period, usually 30 to 60 days, as is typical in the industry.
In the U.S., the UK and selected other countries, we provide Mobile Engineering services to clients with large portfolios of sites or where we have multiple clients in proximity to each other. Rather than using multiple vendors to perform facility services, clients hire us to provide HVAC, electrical and plumbing services, and general interior repair and maintenance. Our multi-disciplined mobile engineers serve numerous clients in a specified geographic area, performing multiple tasks in a single visit and are responsible for the operational success of the sites they service. This service delivery model reduces clients' operating costs by bundling on-site services, leveraging resources across multiple accounts, and reducing travel time between sites.
4. Project & Development Services
Project & Development Services provides consulting, design, management and build services to tenants of leased space, owners in self-occupied buildings and owners of real estate investments, leveraging technology to drive outstanding service delivery. In addition to strategic occupancy planning services, we bring a life-cycle perspective to our clients, from consulting and capital management through design, construction and move in. Project & Development Services also manages all aspects of development and renovation of commercial projects for our clients, in some cases serving as a general contractor. In addition, we provide these services to public-sector clients, particularly to military and government entities, as well as educational institutions, primarily in the U.S. and to a growing extent in other countries. Predominantly in Europe, we provide design, fit-out and refurbishment services on a principal basis under the Tétris brand.
Our Project & Development Services business is generally compensated on the basis of negotiated fees and reimbursement of costs when we are principal to a contract (or client). Individual projects are generally completed in less than one year, but client contracts may extend multiple years in duration and govern a number of discrete projects.

5. Advisory, Consulting and Other
Advisory and Consulting delivers innovative, results-driven real estate solutions that align with client business objectives. We provide clients with specialized, value-added real estate consulting services in such areas as technology implementation and optimization, mergers and acquisitions, asset management, occupier portfolio strategy, workplace solutions, location advisory, industry research, financial optimization strategies, organizational strategy and Six Sigma process solutions. Our professionals focus on translating global best practices into local real estate solutions, creating optimal financial and operational results for our clients across asset classes.
We typically negotiate compensation for Advisory and Consulting based on developed work plans that vary based on the scope and complexity of projects.
Valuation helps clients determine market values for office, retail, industrial, mixed-use and other types of properties. These services may involve valuing a single property or a global portfolio of multiple property types. We conduct valuations, which typically involve commercial property, for a variety of purposes supporting our clients, including acquisitions, dispositions, debt and equity financings, mergers and acquisitions, securities offerings (including initial public offerings) and privatization initiatives. Clients include occupiers, investors and financing sources from the public and private sectors. We usually negotiate compensation for valuation services based on the scale and complexity of each assignment, and our fees typically relate in part to the value of the underlying assets.
We provide Energy and Sustainability Services to occupiers and investors to help them develop and enhance corporate sustainability strategies, address climate risk, green their real estate portfolios, reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint, upgrade building performance by managing Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ("LEED") construction or retrofits, provide sustainable building operations management, and prepare corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports. We have energy and sustainability accredited professionals worldwide. Our teams can benefit a wide range of clients, including Leasing clients who commission green leases, green interior design and green assessments of prospective buildings; Capital Markets and Investment Management clients who want green building valuation assessments; and Project & Development Services clients who request green retrofits to existing buildings. Refer to our latest Global Sustainability Report, available on jll.com, for metrics on documented energy savings, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the work of our sustainability teams.
We generally negotiate compensation for Energy and Sustainability Services for each assignment based on shared savings or the scale and complexity of the project.
Corporate Solutions
Rapid and complex change, including digitization, increasing regulation, globalization and evolving workforce demographics, have created a new world of work and, as a result, a new mandate for corporate real estate with significant opportunities for growth. Our global Corporate Solutions business is positioned to capture this growth by partnering with clients across industries to drive strategic value from their corporate real estate portfolios and people. During 2018, our Corporate Solutions business continued to expand its client base as follows:

FY 2018 JLL Client Wins
Total Wins | | New Business | | Expansions | Renewals
275 | 145 | 78 | 52

While each client is unique, they are consistent in looking for real estate to enable business transformation around three key value levers.

• | Enabling data-driven decisions


• | Achieving operational excellence through improved productivity and financial performance


• | Attracting and retaining key talent through an enhanced corporate real estate user experience

10

Our comprehensive global service delivery platform is designed to achieve these outcomes through a diverse range of strategy, services and digital solutions that address clients’ entire real estate life cycle on both a local and global scale. We consider the real estate life cycle to include: portfolio, capital and operations decisions.
Portfolio. Through the nexus of services our Corporate Solutions business provides to clients, we gain unique information about their corporate real estate footprints and the organizational strategies they have developed to succeed. Combining this with the expertise we can draw from our broader integrated global platform, we advise our clients about how to optimize their workplace strategies and occupancy planning efforts. More broadly, this advice may extend to our clients’ portfolio strategies. When evolution of strategies dictates change, our Corporate Solutions business partners with other professionals throughout our organization to help clients execute leasing, acquisition and disposition strategies.
Capital. Our Corporate Solutions business advises clients across the world about how and when to make critical capital decisions regarding their workplaces and corporate real estate portfolios to maximize the returns on such investments. In many geographies, our design & build professionals work alongside clients to capture the vision of their organizations through the design of space they occupy. We then manage, and in some cases are responsible for, the successful completion of the fit-out activities to achieve their vision. Helping our clients manage the costs they incur to realize their space and location objectives is essential to that strategy. When capital decisions involve a change in location, our relocation management professionals facilitate smooth transitions.
Operations. IFM is our largest service offering within Corporate Solutions and includes management of integrated services that improve operations and performance of individual facilities, as well as the experience of employees and other end-users of the space. Most frequently, new Corporate Solutions client relationships are formed through IFM business wins, which we accomplish both through transitions from other service providers or conversions from in-sourced real estate management models. In addition to maximizing efficiency and quality of service delivery, our digitally-enabled platform also provides clients with opportunities to tailor the balance of services we provide versus what they self-perform.
In an era of rapid digital evolution, technology is core to the advancement of our Corporate Solutions business in all facets. This is enabled by a best-in-class approach to technology and data management that centers around a structured product management discipline, a holistic build-buy-partner strategy and investments in world-class technology talent. Corporate Solutions brings a unique, comprehensive offering that covers all client technology needs, from consulting and foundational data management and Smart Buildings, to RED(sm) - our proprietary analytics and BI platform - that delivers actionable insights. Through Digital Solutions, which we have grown primarily through strategic acquisitions, our professionals assist clients in their selection and implementation of real estate-related software and applications to better help them understand their portfolios and drive efficiencies. We are committed to innovation to advance our Corporate Solutions business as the digital evolution continues.
LaSalle
Complementing our real estate services capabilities, our global real estate investment management business, LaSalle, has three priorities:

• | Deliver superior risk-adjusted investment returns to our clients


• | Develop and execute investment strategies that meet the specific investment objectives of our clients


• | Deliver uniformly high levels of client service globally

We are one of the world's largest managers of institutional capital invested in real estate assets and securities, providing investment management services to institutional and retail investors, including high-net-worth individuals. We seek to establish and maintain relationships of trust with sophisticated investors who value our global platform and extensive local market knowledge.
LaSalle provides clients with a broad range of real estate investment products and services in the private and public capital markets. We design these products and services to meet the differing strategic, asset allocation, risk/return and liquidity requirements of clients. The range of investment solutions includes private investments in multiple real estate property types, including office, retail, industrial, health care and multifamily residential, as well as investments in debt. We act either through commingled investment funds or single client account relationships ("separate accounts"). We also offer indirect public investments, primarily in publicly traded real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and other real estate equities.
11

LaSalle's assets under management of $60.5 billion, as of December 31, 2018, by geographic distribution and fund type were as follows ($ in billions):

We believe LaSalle's success is the product of our strong investment performance, industry-leading research capabilities, experienced investment professionals, innovative investment strategies, global presence and coordinated platform, local market knowledge and strong client focus. Research and strategy are integrated throughout the investment management process, from portfolio strategy formulation and property acquisition, through ongoing asset management and disposition.
The investment and capital origination activities of our investment management business have become increasingly global. We have invested in direct real estate assets in 20 countries around the globe, as well as in public real estate companies traded on all major stock exchanges.
Where consistent with client requirements and market terms and conditions, LaSalle from time to time retains JLL to provide services to assets in LaSalle funds in the ordinary course of business.
Direct Investments in Real Estate Properties (Separate Accounts and Commingled Funds)
In serving our investment management clients, LaSalle is responsible for the acquisition, financing, leasing, management and divestiture of real estate investments across a broad range of real estate property types. LaSalle launched its first institutional investment fund in 1979 and currently has a series of commingled investment funds, including seven funds that invest in assets in the Americas, seven funds that invest in assets located in Europe, and five funds that invest in assets in Asia Pacific. LaSalle also maintains separate account relationships with investors for whom we manage private real estate investments.
LaSalle is the advisor to Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust, Inc. ("JLL IPT"), a daily valued, non-listed U.S. real estate investment trust launched in 2012 that gives suitable individual investors access to a growing portfolio of diversified commercial real estate investments. As of December 31, 2018, JLL IPT had $2.6 billion in assets under management.
Some investors prefer to partner with investment managers willing to co-invest their own funds to more closely align the interests of the investor and the investment manager. We believe that our ability to co-invest alongside our clients' funds will continue to be an important factor in maintaining and continually improving our competitive position. We believe our co-investment strategy strengthens our ability to raise capital for new real estate investments and real estate funds. In addition, co-investment may bring the opportunity to provide additional services related to the acquisition, financing, property management, leasing and disposition of such investments. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $306 million of co-investments, alongside our clients, in real estate ventures included in LaSalle's total assets under management.
12

LaSalle is generally compensated for investment management services for private equity investments based on capital committed, invested and managed (advisory fees), with additional fees (incentive fees) tied to investment performance above benchmark levels. In some cases, LaSalle also receives fees tied to acquisitions and dispositions. Our investment funds have various life spans, typically ranging between five and nine years, but in some cases they are open-ended. Separate account advisory agreements generally have specific terms with "at will" termination provisions, and include fee arrangements that are linked to the market value of the assets under management, plus incentive fees in some cases.
Investments in Public Securities
LaSalle also offers clients the ability to invest in separate accounts focused on public real estate securities. We invest the capital of these clients principally in publicly traded securities of real estate investment trusts and property companies. As of December 31, 2018, LaSalle had approximately $6.9 billion of assets under management in these types of investments. LaSalle is typically compensated by securities investment clients on the basis of the market value of assets under management.
INDUSTRY TRENDS
We are focused on four major macroeconomic trends affecting the real estate sector today, each with an estimated multi-year lifespan:
Rising investment allocations and globalization of capital flows to real estate
Once categorized as alternative investments, real estate has emerged over the past decade as a major defined asset class of its own, with a sustained long-term trend of attracting rising investment allocations. Investors continue to allocate significant portions of their investment capital to real estate. Supporting that, we see parallel sustained growth trajectories in transaction volumes and in capital flows across borders and between continents, creating new opportunities for advisors and investment managers equipped to source and facilitate international real estate capital flows and execute cross-border transactions. Our real estate investment expertise, linking seamlessly across the world's major markets, is ideally placed to support our clients' investment ambitions.
As noted above in the LaSalle section, many investors have shown a desire to commit their capital to investment managers willing to co-invest their own capital in specific real estate investments or real estate funds.
Growth in corporate outsourcing
As a proportion of the total commercial-built real estate worldwide, corporate outsourcing of real estate services is still at a relatively early stage, but it is a trend that continues to move steadily upward as more businesses look to drive efficiency and returns by partnering with dedicated real estate service providers. In recent years, outsourcing of professional real estate services has increased substantially, as corporations focus their own resources on core competencies. Although some continue to unbundle and separate the sources of their real estate services, medium-to-large users of commercial real estate services continue to demonstrate an overall preference for working with single-source service providers able to operate seamlessly from a local to global level. The ability to offer a full range of services on this scale requires significant infrastructure investment, including digital applications and personnel training. Smaller regional and local real estate service firms, with limited resources, are less able to make such investments. In addition, public and other non-corporate users of real estate, including government agencies and health and educational institutions, have begun to outsource real estate activities as a means of reducing costs. As a result, we believe there will continue to be significant growth opportunities for companies like ours that can provide integrated real estate services across many geographic markets and types of clients.
Many such clients are striving to control costs by outsourcing or off-shoring non-core business activities. Both trends have increased the demand for global real estate services, including facility management, tenant representation and leasing, and property and energy management services. We believe that these trends will favor real estate service providers with the capability to provide services - and at consistently high service levels - in multiple markets around the world. Our diverse outsourcing services, shown below, address clients' needs across the real estate life cycle.
13

Urbanization
Growing urbanization continues to be a powerful global trend. In its May 2018 report, the United Nations Department of Economic & Social Affairs predicted that 68% of the global population will live in urban areas by 2050, up from 55% as of the publication date (with total global population growth of just over 1% per year). More specifically, the international hub cities where we and our clients do a substantial majority of our business are thriving. This is another sustained trend that successfully overrides national and global political changes and uncertainties. 
4th Industrial Revolution
The 4th Industrial Revolution technology, data and the rapid rise in applications of artificial intelligence ("AI") is changing everything. However, there is currently no single technology disruptor positioned to dominate the real estate industry. Instead, thousands of start-ups, applications and concepts are vying to transform the marketplace. The challenge to innovate and maximize the potential benefits of new technology, data and AI uses is constant. At the heart of our Beyond strategy (discussed in detail below), supported by major ongoing investments and innovations, we continue to accelerate progress toward our goal of becoming the widely-recognized leading user of technology and data in real estate.
SUSTAINING OUR ENTERPRISE: A BUSINESS MODEL THAT COMBINES DIFFERENT CAPITAL TO CREATE STAKEHOLDER VALUE
Our global sustainability commitment - Building A Better Tomorrow
Our vision is to make JLL a world-leading, sustainable professional services firm by creating spaces, buildings and cities where everyone can thrive. The world’s financial, social and environmental challenges demand a bolder response from businesses around the globe. This is why we are committed to new ways of partnering with our stakeholders to achieve shared ambitions for a sustainable future.
14

From serving our clients and engaging our people, to respecting natural resources in our workplaces and building community relationships, we are focused on what is good for business and for a sustainable future. This progressive approach increases value for all our stakeholders and leads to responsible investment decisions as well as healthier, safer and more engaged people. We are Building a Better Tomorrow everywhere we can.
Creating sustainable value for all our stakeholders
We have designed our business model to (i) create value for our clients, shareholders and employees, (ii) establish high-quality relationships with the suppliers we engage and the communities in which we operate, and (iii) respond to macroeconomic trends impacting the real estate sector. Based on our intimate knowledge of local real estate and capital markets worldwide, as well as our investments in thought leadership and technology, we create value for clients by addressing their real estate needs as well as their broader business, strategic, operating and longer-term sustainability goals. 
We strive to create a healthy and dynamic balance between activities that will produce short-term value and returns for our stakeholders through effective management of current transactions and business activities, and investments in people (such as new hires), acquisitions, technologies and systems designed to produce sustainable returns over the long term.
The following diagram summarizes how we create value for our shareholders and our broader stakeholders. It starts with the capital resources - or inputs - we need to do business. We use these resources to deliver services - or outputs - for our clients through the business activities we manage.
15

We apply our business model to the resources and capitals that we employ to provide services. We provide these services through our own employees and, where necessary or appropriate in the case of property and facility management and project and development services, through the management of third-party contractors. The revenue and profits we earn from those efforts are allocated among further investments in our business, employee compensation and returns to our shareholders. We are increasingly focused on linking our business and sustainability strategies to promote the goal of creating long-term value for our shareholders, clients, employees and the global community of which JLL is a part. These efforts help our clients manage their real estate more effectively and efficiently, promote employment globally and create wealth for our shareholders and employees. In turn, they allow us to be an increasingly impactful member of, and positive force within, the communities in which we operate.
STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK
In December 2016, our Global Executive Board (“GEB”) set out the broad framework for Beyond, a new and ambitious strategic vision to drive long-term sustainable and profitable global growth, incorporating transformational enhancements to our digital, data and AI capabilities, and complementing our unwavering commitment to the highest standards of client service, teamwork, ethics and expertise.
During 2017, the GEB developed the specific initiatives, goals and investment priorities to support the Beyond strategic vision and led implementation of the foundational steps. Examples included consolidation of the company’s technology, data and information management resources into a single globally aligned and managed group; initiating work on transformational global platform enhancements for our Finance and Human Resources capabilities; establishing JLL Spark as a global proptech innovation entity based in Silicon Valley; launching our Achieve Ambitions brand identity and accompanying Achieve Your Ambitions employee value proposition; as well as a series of platform investments into further enhancing our global Capital Markets and Corporate Solutions capabilities.
Through 2018, strong ongoing business performance enabled us to accelerate the pace of our multi-year Beyond transformation. Examples included launching the JLL Spark Global Venture Fund and securing several subsequent proptech investments; implementing a new consistent and transparent global career framework and launching a comprehensive single system supporting our human resources interactions for our global employee base of over 90,000 people; introducing CapForce, an advanced and globally integrated CRM system for our Capital Markets teams worldwide; establishing and resourcing a dedicated high-caliber Global Transformation Office to add fresh expertise and impetus to the next phases of our transformation program; business acquisitions to expand our LaSalle platform in Europe and the U.S.; and the launch of our new fully-integrated and wholly-redesigned global website jll.com.
We expect this accelerated momentum in our transformation program to continue through 2019 and 2020. In the following section, we summarize the pillars and guiding priorities in our multi-year Beyond strategic vision.

Within our Beyond strategy, we are making significant ongoing investments in advanced client relationship management processes and tools, always with a core commitment to ensuring that our own systems and structures never become an obstacle to assembling international and multidisciplinary teams tailored to meet each client’s requirements.
People
Directly supporting our goals to constantly enhance our client services, we continually invest in our people. We are committed to helping our people achieve their ambitions by enabling them to explore new opportunities, build expertise, create long-term careers, work with other talented people, and succeed through inclusion. Achieve your ambitions, our employee value proposition, articulates the key attractions and advantages of a career with JLL. We offer inclusive, collaborative and flexible working environments and an array of developmental and training opportunities. We continue to support our people in their career planning and progression and have refreshed and updated our worldwide career development and management tools, launching MyPerformance as our new performance management platform to guide employees on maintaining and improving performance and implementing a comprehensive single global system to support human resource interactions with all our employees. In 2018, we also introduced a global career framework that provides transparency and clarity on career paths and allows for our people to explore new career opportunities. We support career growth by providing guidance on globally-aligned leadership capabilities and offering formal mentoring and coaching programs. Our people, their skills and aspirations, and their commitment to a consistently high-performance culture and JLL’s core values are central to our ongoing success and sustained profitable growth.

Digital
Technology has transformed the definitions of work, workplace and workforce in all aspects of business. We are only at the front edge of the wave of change that digitization, data and analytics, AI and machine learning will bring to our clients, people and shareholders.
Digital is core to our growth strategy. Examples of our investments in leading-edge technology and data capabilities include the following.

• | Digitally transforming and enabling delivery of global services with a best-in-class technology foundation and an operational emphasis on data and analytics. This includes increasingly leveraging AI and machine learnings to drive insights, speed and accuracy. A notable example is our 2015 acquisition of Corrigo, which enables our facilities management business globally and continues to grow as a component of our integrated platform


• | Expanding Digital Solutions, our global digital advisory and implementation services capability, which is unique to our industry. Critical to our Corporate Solutions business, Digital Solutions designs, integrates and implements innovative digital solutions for clients across industry types in the areas of corporate systems of record, smart buildings and workplace experience. In 2018, we nearly doubled the size of this team through the acquisition of ValuD Consulting, a leading provider of software integration and consulting services. The combined team will bring the next generation of technology to our clients to accelerated innovation and deepened expertise in software platforms


• | Hiring executive leadership from the technology industry to guide our digital transformation


• | Launching JLL Spark in 2017, focused on creating new property technology products, related strategic investments and incubating technology startups. In mid-2018, we expanded this initiative through the creation of the JLL Spark Global Venture Fund, with plans to invest over a five-year period up to $100 million in a number of exciting proptech ventures with considerable growth potential; visit www.us.jll.com/en/jll-spark to view the investments we have already made

These investments, along with digital enhancements in our internal platform and throughout our core service offerings, put us in position to extend our role as the digital leader in corporate real estate.
Values
All our people are committed to the core values of teamwork, ethics and excellence. These values are the foundation of our organization. Clients, employees, business partners and potential recruits are strongly attracted to these values and to our commitments to a sustainable future through Building a Better Tomorrow, our sustainability leadership ambition. This has earned us repeated recognition from organizations such as the Ethisphere Institute, which in 2018 named JLL as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for the 11th consecutive year.
Brand
We continue to strengthen and expand awareness of our brand beyond the traditional real estate sector, with a focused goal in our Beyond strategic vision to reach more CEOs and other senior decision makers. Supporting this goal, we are an active strategic partner of the World Economic Forum and regular participant in its annual meeting in Davos and at other events. In January 2019, Fortune magazine again named JLL as one of the World’s Most Admired Companies (see below for further awards and recognition during the past year). As part of our Beyond strategy, we launched a new visual identity and brand positioning strategy centered on our Achieve Ambitions theme, which is relevant to all our clients and other stakeholders.
18

Growth
Our Beyond priorities for clients, people, values, digital and brand combine to provide an integrated strategic vision and platform for growth. This vision is supported by our commitment to enhance productivity in all operations, building margin and creating the basis for long-term sustainable and profitable growth, which reward all our stakeholders, helping them achieve their ambitions. 
Consistent with this overarching aim, our Beyond strategic vision overlays and complements additional longstanding strategic priorities for JLL including:

• | Employing a growth-oriented investment philosophy that best meets client needs while focusing resources on the services, markets and cities generating the highest margin opportunities


• | Establishing charters for internal business boards to promote more interconnected global approaches to client services and delivery


• | Leveraging our market-leading research capabilities and data analytics to better inform and advise our clients, enabling them to maximize the value of their real estate portfolios


• | Deploying additional digital tools, data and metrics to help our people become progressively more productive and efficient


• | Determining how best to marshal, train, recruit, motivate and retain the human resources that will have the skill sets, diversity and other abilities necessary to accomplish our strategic objectives


• | Continuing to develop our brand and reputation for high quality client service, integrity, excellence and in-depth local and global market knowledge


• | Building our brand in digital and social media channels


• | Continuing to promote best-in-class governance, compliance, enterprise risk management and professional standards to operate a sustainable organization which meets the significant challenges and risks inherent in global markets and minimizes disruptions to, and distractions from, the accomplishment of our corporate mission


• | Translating our Beyond strategy into best-in-class total shareholder returns

We regularly reevaluate our strategic priorities to optimize sustainable and profitable long-term growth and on-going value creation for all our stakeholders. Our Beyond strategic vision and priorities for growth are built on our closely integrated platform, which combines deep local market knowledge with seamless advice and services tailored to each client’s specific needs.
COMPETITION
We operate across a wide variety of highly competitive business lines within the commercial real estate industry globally. Our significant growth over the last decade, and our ability to take advantage of the substantial consolidation that has taken place in our industry, have made us one of the largest commercial real estate services and investment management providers on a global basis.
Since we provide a broad range of commercial real estate and investment management services across many geographies, we face significant competition at international, regional and local levels. We also face competition from companies who may not traditionally be thought of as real estate service providers, including institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, accounting firms, technology firms, software-as-a-service companies, firms providing co-working space, firms providing outsourcing services of various types (including technology, food service and building products), and companies that self-provide their real estate services with in-house capabilities.
19

DISTINGUISHING ATTRIBUTES AND COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATORS
Our mission is to deliver exceptional strategic, fully-integrated services, best practices and innovative solutions for real estate owners, occupiers, investors and developers worldwide. We deliver a combination of services, expertise and technology applications via an integrated global platform that we own (and do not franchise). These characteristics distinguish us from our competitors, contribute to service excellence and customer loyalty, and affirm our commitment to sustaining our business over the long term. We seek to successfully manage the financial, environmental, and social risks and opportunities our complex organization faces, and help our clients do the same. While we face high-quality competition in individual markets, we believe the following are some of the key attributes which make us the best choice for clients seeking real estate and investment management services on a worldwide basis.

• | Our focus on client relationship management to provide superior client service on a highly coordinated basis


• | Our integrated global platform with local market knowledge, including a highly diverse set of service offerings, enables our ability to deliver our expertise wherever clients need it


• | Our ability to deliver innovative solutions and technology applications to help our clients maximize the value of their real estate portfolios


• | Our ability to organize and analyze the significant data about real estate that we collect in the course of business


• | The quality and worldwide reach of our industry-leading research function, enhanced by digital applications and our ability to synthesize complex information into practical advice for clients


• | Our reputation for consistent and trustworthy service delivery worldwide, based on our best practices and the skills, experience, collaborative nature and integrity of our people


• | The strength of our brand and reputation, including our reputation as an ethical organization


• | The strength of our financial position


• | Our employee engagement as well as our employee value proposition - Achieve your ambitions - which articulates what differentiates JLL as an employer


• | The quality of our internal governance and enterprise risk management, which clients can rely on over the long term


• | The management of our supply chain for the benefit of the project management, property and facility management, and other services we provide to clients


• | Our sustainability leadership agenda, which addresses long-term financial, environmental and social risks and opportunities for ourselves and our clients


• | Our culture of teamwork, ethics and excellence, which allows us to marshal resources to deliver the greatest possible value and results


• | Our "client first" and ethical orientation, which enables our people to focus on how to best provide what our clients need and want with integrity and transparency


• | Our strong intellectual capital, long-term approach to business and ability to anticipate, interpret and respond to the trends influencing our industry sector makes us quick and nimble in adapting to new challenges and opportunities in a fast-changing world and in helping our clients do the same

The following is a detailed discussion on select distinguishing attributes and competitive differentiators noted above.
Client Relationship Management. We support our ability to deliver superior service to our clients through our ongoing investments in client relationship management and account management. As an example, CapForce, our sophisticated new CRM tool, links all our capital markets business lines and activities around the world. Our goal is to provide each client with a single point of contact at our company, an individual responsive to and accountable for all the activities we undertake for the client. We believe that we enhance superior client service through best practices in client relationship management, seeking and acting on regular client feedback, and recognizing each client's own specific definition of excellence.
Our client-driven focus enables us to develop long-term client relationships that generate repeat business and create recurring revenue sources. In many cases, we establish strategic alliances with clients whose ongoing service needs mesh with our ability to deliver fully integrated real estate services across multiple business units and locations. We support our relationship focus with an employee compensation and evaluation system aligned with our global career framework, designed to reward client relationship building, teamwork and quality performance, in addition to revenue development.
20

Integrated Global Business Model. By combining a wide range of high-quality, complementary services and delivering them at consistently high service levels globally through wholly-owned offices with directly employed personnel, we develop and implement real estate strategies that meet the increasingly complex and far-reaching needs of our clients. We also believe that we can grow revenue without a proportionate increase in infrastructure costs due to our established business presence in the world's principal real estate markets. With operations spanning the globe, we have in-depth knowledge of local and regional markets and can provide a full range of real estate services around the world. This geographic coverage, combined with the ability and willingness of our people to communicate and connect with each other across a common global platform, positions us to serve the needs of our multinational clients and manage the flow of investment capital on a global basis. We anticipate that our cross-selling potential across geographies and product lines will continue to develop new revenue sources which we will enhance by continuing to expand our services via complementary or adjacent offerings.
Industry-Leading Research Capabilities. We invest in and rely on comprehensive research to support and guide the development of real estate and investment strategy for our clients. With nearly 550 research professionals who gather data and cover market and economic conditions around the world, we are an authority on the economics and market dynamics of commercial real estate. Research plays a key role in keeping colleagues throughout the organization attuned to important trends and changing conditions in world markets. We continue to devise and invest in new approaches through data science techniques and other technology to make our research, services and property offerings more readily available to our people and clients.
We believe that our investments in research, technology, data science and analytics, people and thought leadership position JLL as a leading innovator in our industry. Our research initiatives investigate emerging trends to help us anticipate future conditions and shape new services to benefit our clients, which in turn help us secure and maintain profitable long-term relationships with the clients we target: the world's leading real estate owners, occupiers, investors and developers.
Delivery of Innovative Solutions and Consistent Worldwide Service (including through applications of technology and data science). We believe that our globally-coordinated investments in research, technology, data science and analytics, people, quality control and innovation, combined with the facts that our offices are wholly-owned (rather than franchised), and our professionals are directly employed, enable us to develop, share and continually evaluate best practices across our global organization. As a result, we deliver consistently high levels of client service and operational excellence substantially wherever our clients' real estate investment and services needs exist.
Based on our general industry knowledge and on specific client feedback, we believe we are recognized as an industry leader in technology and business intelligence. We provide sophisticated information technology systems on a global basis to serve our clients and support our employees. For example, RED(sm), our client extranet technology, provides clients with detailed and comprehensive insight into their portfolios, the markets in which they operate, and the services we provide to them.
Connect (sm), our intranet technology, offers our employees access to our policies, news and collective thinking regarding our experience, skills and best practices. In addition, we are enhancing the global integration of our systems for finance, human resources and client relationship management, as well as securities management and trading systems for our investment management business. As previously noted, we launched our new global people information system across the globe in 2018. Also this year, select countries in the Americas region have implemented the upgrade to our digitally integrated finance system, with implementation across other geographies continuing in 2019.
We will continue to develop and deploy technology as well as online and social media applications to support our marketing and client development activities and to make our services and real estate property listings increasingly accessible.
Maximizing the Value of Real Estate Portfolios. Our global strategic perspective and presence allow us to assess pricing trends for real estate and know which investors worldwide are investing actively. This gives us an advantage in implementing strategies for acquisitions and dispositions of properties.
During hold periods, our local market research allows us to assess the potential for cash flow enhancement in our clients' assets based on rental-rate trends. When combined, these two perspectives provide us with an optimal view that leads to timely execution and translates into superior investment performance for clients.
21

Strong Brand and Reputation. We believe that large corporations and institutional investors and occupiers of real estate recognize our ability to create value reliably in changing market conditions, based on (i) evidence provided by marketing surveys we have commissioned, (ii) the extensive coverage we receive in top-tier business publications, (iii) the major awards we receive in real estate, sustainability and ethics, as well as (iv) our significant, long-standing client relationships. Our reputation derives from our deep industry knowledge, excellence in service delivery, integrity and our global provision of high-quality, professional real estate and investment management services. We believe that the combined strength of the JLL and LaSalle brands represents a significant advantage when we pursue new business opportunities and is also a major motivator for talented people to join us around the world.
The JLL name, which is also our New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol, is our primary trading name. Jones Lang LaSalle remains our legal name. Using the shorter JLL name facilitates its adaptation to different communication styles in different countries, languages and channels and especially to the use of digital and online channels for marketing and communications.
We believe we hold the "Jones Lang LaSalle," "JLL" and "LaSalle Investment Management" trademarks and the related logos, which we expect to continue to renew, as necessary, to conduct the material aspects of our business globally. We have obtained the right to use the top level domain names of each of ".jll" and ".lasalle" from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
Financial Strength. We focus on maintaining financial performance metrics, particularly our leverage and debt service coverage ratios, that allow us to maintain investment-grade financial ratings. We believe that confidence in the financial strength of long-term service providers has become increasingly important to our clients, who are increasingly making financial strength an important criterion when they select real estate service providers. Accordingly, our ability to present a superior financial condition distinguishes us as we compete for business.
We also believe that our broad geographic reach and the range of our global service offerings diversify the sources of our revenue, reducing the overall inherent volatility of operating a real estate services business. This creates an additional measure of financial stability relative to other firms with more limited service offerings, or that are only local or regional, and therefore must rely on the strength of fewer markets and services.
We continue our long history of investment grade ratings from Moody's and S&P. Our issuer and senior unsecured ratings as of December 31, 2018 are Baa1 (stable outlook) from Moody’s and BBB+ (stable outlook) from S&P.
Our primary source of credit is our unsecured credit facility (the "Facility") provided by an international syndicate of banks, which as of December 31, 2018 had a maximum borrowing capacity of $2.75 billion and a maturity date in May 2023. In addition, we have €350.0 million of fixed-rate senior notes with half due in June 2027 and the other half due in June 2029 as well as $275 million of fixed-rate senior notes due in November 2022. Our senior notes have increased our proportion of fixed-rate debt.
Strong Governance, Enterprise Risk Management and Integrity. Our overlapping and communicative senior management and Board of Directors structure promotes an environment of best practices in corporate governance and controls. We believe that these attributes allow us to infuse a culture of internal communication and connectivity throughout the organization.
Successful management of any organization's enterprise risks is critical to its long-term viability. We seek to promote, operate and continually improve a globally-integrated enterprise risk management model that optimizes our overall risk/reward profile through the coordinated and sophisticated interaction of business and corporate staff functions.
Related to our governance and enterprise risk management efforts, we believe in uncompromising integrity and the highest ethical conduct. We are proud of the global reputation we have earned and are determined to protect and enhance it. The integrity our brand represents is one of our most valuable assets and a strong differentiator for our company.
Building a Better Tomorrow - our sustainability leadership ambition. Through Building a Better Tomorrow, we seek to meet our sustainability vision through four Pillars depicted below: Clients, People, Workplaces and Communities. These Pillars are underpinned by three Foundations: our commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance, our efforts to drive sustainability thought leadership and our commitment to deploying innovative, forward thinking solutions for ourselves and our clients. To ensure these efforts support our broader business strategy, Building a Better Tomorrow is an integral part of our long-term strategic vision, Beyond.
22

By addressing issues which materially affect our clients, investors, employees and communities, we drive positive change through our organization and more widely. For this reason, we recently undertook three reviews to identify our most material sustainability considerations.
In 2017, these reviews were supplemented by additional materiality assessment in collaboration with Ceres, a sustainability nonprofit organization focused on economy-centric solutions, to ensure we are addressing the most significant sustainability impacts through Building a Better Tomorrow. The top five material environmental and social issues identified were:

Environmental Issues | Social Issues 
1. | Energy consumption and emissions | 1. | Business ethics and integrity 
2. | Sustainable buildings | 2. | Innovation and technology 
3. | Enhancing client sustainability through our services | 3. | Health, safety and security 
4. | Climate risk | 4. | Talent attraction and retention
5. | Responsible supply chain | 5. | Employee wellbeing 

Having exceeded our previous targets at the end of 2017, we set ambitious new goals for JLL based on the results of our materiality process. These goals cover all four Pillars of Building a Better Tomorrow and are covered in detail in our current annual Global Sustainability Report.
Generating sustainable value for our clients. The 4.6 billion square feet of space that we manage globally for our clients gives us the opportunity to have an impact through industry-leading strategies, tools and technologies that significantly improve energy efficiency and societal impacts, as well as reduce costs. Embedding sustainability considerations across our service lines is one of our key priorities, enabling us to offer differentiated and forward-thinking solutions to our clients, as we seek to maximize the positive impact we can have in the world.
Our Energy and Sustainability Services teams provide a range of services covering the construction, operation and maintenance of clients’ facilities as well as advice on occupier behavior, socio-economic impacts and site location. In addition to the clear environmental and societal benefits these activities deliver, they also yield significant operational and cost efficiencies. For these reasons, we invest substantial resources into continuing our development of world-class energy and sustainability solutions for our clients. 
Our commitment to technological innovation extends to our sustainability service offering. We have developed a number of in-house technology platforms to help us deliver our clients’ sustainability objectives. For example, our OneView Energy and Sustainability Analytics (OVESA) platform is used to manage the ever-increasing volumes of complex sustainability data. 
23

This system, along with our other platforms such as the Portfolio Energy and Environment Reporting System (PEERS) and the Energy and Sustainability Platform (ESP), reflects our commitment to investing in digital, data and information management platforms. By deploying flexible digital solutions, we are able to measure, manage and improve environmental impacts for the nearly 200,000 buildings included on these platforms.
Sustainability thought leadership. We have earned a reputation for progressive thinking through extensive investments in research and thought leadership. In 2018, we produced sustainability thought leadership covering topics as diverse as climate change adaptation, sustainable building design and employee productivity, and workplace economics. Many of these pieces were published on our LinkedIn sustainability showcase, Green Blog and Real Views web pages. We work with global and local sustainability organizations to develop new ways of thinking around some of the biggest challenges facing our sector. This includes working alongside organizations such as the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark and the World Green Building Council. In addition, we have been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since 2009.
Employee Value Proposition. Based on input from our employees about our culture and what makes us stand out as an employer, we developed the employee value proposition - Achieve your ambitions - a shared framework to inspire talent to join us, engage our employees and celebrate the values and culture of JLL around the world. An integral part of our brand, it is our promise to our people - employees and candidates alike - and centers on five unique pillars, depicted in the following graphic.
Our goal-setting framework uses three categories of goals (clients, growth and people) that align our people’s efforts with enterprise-wide strategy throughout all levels of the organization and build focus and attention on our priorities.
Awards. We won numerous awards and recognitions in 2018 that reflect the quality of the services we provide to our clients, the integrity of our people and our desirability as a place to work. As examples, we were named:

• | A member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the third consecutive year

INTEGRATED REPORTING
As a part of the Business Network and Framework Panel of the International Integrated Reporting Council ("IIRC"), we support the general principles designed to promote communications and integrated thinking about how an organization's strategy, governance and financial and non-financial performance lead to the creation of value over the short, medium and long term.
Components of Our Integrated Report. This Annual Report on Form 10-K focuses on our business strategy and our financial performance, including an attempt to illustrate how being a sustainable enterprise is integral to our success. Our citizenship and sustainability efforts for ourselves and our clients are reflected primarily in our annual Global Sustainability Report.
Our governance and remuneration practices are reported primarily in the Proxy Statement for our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The mechanisms we use to make our clients comfortable with respect to our transparency and fair dealing are summarized in our Transparency Report. The behaviors and standards we expect of our employees and of the suppliers we engage for our own company and on behalf of clients are presented in our Code of Business Ethics and our Vendor Code of Conduct. Our Corporate Facts document is intended to provide an overall summary of the information we believe will be of primary interest to our different stakeholders.
We intend this Annual Report to satisfy the requirements of the International <IR> Framework issued by the IIRC in December 2013 (www.theiirc.org). Following the Exhibit Index, we present a tie-out sheet that cross-references the requirements in the Framework and the locations of our responses within this Annual Report. In 2015, we first launched an electronic Integrated Report on our website which provides access to all our information embedded in the documents discussed above through one access portal.
Responsibility for Integrated Reporting. Our Finance and Legal Services functions are primarily responsible for the integrity of our integrated reporting efforts and acknowledge that we have applied a collaborative approach in the preparation and presentation of this report. To do so, we have also engaged other senior members of our organization. In our collective opinion, this report is presented in accordance with the Framework. However, as our effort to comply with the Framework is done voluntarily and continues to evolve, we disclaim any legal liability to the extent that this report is deemed to not comply with the Framework.
Alignment with the Integrated Reporting Framework. Building on our Beyond strategy and as an important part of our aim to align more closely with the Integrated Reporting Framework, in 2017 we began to identify the medium- to long-term global megatrends with the greatest potential to materially impact our business. To do this, we used the 'six capitals' model advocated by the IIRC: financial, human, intellectual, manufactured, social and natural capitals.
While we are most heavily dependent on the financial, human and intellectual capitals to execute our own operations successfully, we identified significant trends with implications for our business across all six capitals. Furthermore, changes in the availability of all six capitals impact our clients’ businesses and by extension, our service provision.
We have identified a number of global trends as significant for our business in the medium to long term. All of these, which we are tracking and/or actively managing, are illustrated below. The "JLL Activities," which address these trends, are summarized in the table below primarily via a combination of references to sections within Items 1 and 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and resources we publish on our website, where we discuss relevant points in more detail.
25

Driving improvements in Integrated Reporting. We recognize Integrated Reporting is a journey rather than a destination. We are constantly seeking to enhance the way we disclose our corporate information, striving to convey our value-creation story in the fullest way possible. To support these efforts, we have established an Integrated Reporting Working Group made up of representatives of key business functions. The group is tasked not only with furthering efforts to improve our reporting processes and increase our alignment with the <IR> Framework, but also to foster a culture of integrated thinking within the business. Through this Working Group, we are also considering how best to take forward the recommendations from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.
Our Materiality Process. We actively identify our long-term risks and opportunities specifically with a view to furthering our integrated reporting journey. This effort complements the Enterprise Risk Management processes we conduct and has enabled further engagement with internal executives; prioritized our long-term risks and opportunities to generate further business value based on the IIRC’s guidance; and helped us articulate how to manage and take advantage of long-term risks and opportunities in reports like this and in our sustainability reporting.
We used the 'six capitals' model from the IR Framework to identify and investigate a number of global trends with the potential to impact our business. This process helped us identify where and how different trends interact with one another. Using this model, we created an initial list of 36 trends and their potential implications for us. We then undertook one-on-one engagements with around 30 executives from different disciplines and geographies across JLL to present the six capitals model; discuss the trends identified; and understand, based on these trends, what the potential risks and opportunities are to JLL and how we are, or should be, responding to them. We then developed comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analyses based on these internal engagements and aligned them with our existing risk-management matrix. We scored the long-term trends according to likelihood and magnitude, taking account of potential impacts on different areas of the business. The result of this scoring is the six capitals risks and opportunities materiality matrices, shown below, which allowed us to identify the most material long-term risks and opportunities for our company.
Since 2014, our GEB and other senior leadership have continued to monitor the evolution of both our opportunities and risks. On a macro basis, they have remained broadly consistent, with some changes in relative significance as, for example, threats of cyber attacks and data theft that have continued to rise. For additional discussion of our risks and the ways we mitigate them, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.

SEASONALITY
A large portion of our revenue is seasonal, which investors should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations from quarter to quarter. Historically, our quarterly revenue and profits have tended to increase from quarter to quarter as the year progresses. This is a result of a general focus in the real estate industry on completing or documenting transactions by calendar year-end and the fact that certain expenses are constant through the year. Historically, we have reported a relatively smaller profit in the first quarter and then increasingly larger profits during each of the following three quarters, excluding the recognition of investment-generated performance fees and realized and unrealized co-investment equity earnings and losses, each of which is inherently unpredictable. We generally recognize such performance fees and realized co-investment equity earnings or losses when assets are sold, the timing of which is geared toward the benefit of our clients. Non-variable operating expenses, which we treat as expenses when incurred during the year, are relatively constant on a quarterly basis.
27

EMPLOYEES
The following table reflects our global headcount for reimbursable and non-reimbursable employees.

(in thousands) | December 31, 2018 | December 31, 2017
Professional non-reimbursable employees | 47.8 | | 42.3
Directly reimbursable employees | 42.2 | | 39.6
Total employees | 90.0 | | 81.9

Directly reimbursable employees have costs which are fully reimbursed by clients, primarily in our Corporate Solutions business. Specifically, reimbursable employees include our property and IFM professionals as well as our building maintenance employees.
Our employees do not report being members of any labor unions, with the exception of approximately 2,300 property maintenance employees in the United States, 80% of whom are reimbursable. As of both December 31, 2018, and 2017, approximately 70% of our employees were based in countries other than the United States.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We regard our technology and other intellectual property, including our brands, as a critical part of our business.
We hold various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We own numerous domain names, have registered numerous trademarks, and have filed applications for the registration of a number of our other trademarks and service marks in the United States and in foreign countries. We own the rights to use the dot-jll (.jll) and dot-lasalle (.lasalle) top level domain names, which we acquired during 2015.
Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by the expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “JLL,” "Jones Lang LaSalle," “LaSalle,” and "LaSalle Investment Management" names, and our Design (Three Circles) mark that is also trademarked. Our trademark registrations have to be renewed every ten years. Based on our most recent trademark registrations, the JLL mark would expire in 2024, while the Jones Lang LaSalle name would expire in 2022 and the Design (Three Circles) mark would expire in 2021. Our LaSalle and LaSalle Investment Management marks will expire in 2026.
In addition to our trademarks and trade names, we also have proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services and analysis. Consistent with our belief that we are recognized as an industry leader in technology as discussed above, we currently have a patented process in the United States for a "System and Method for Evaluating Real Estate Financing Structures" that assists clients with determining the optimal financing structure for controlling their real estate assets, including, for example, whether a client should own a particular asset, lease the asset, or control the asset by means of some other financing structure. In addition, we have patented an electrical panel in the United States entitled, “Energized Parts Guard,” which consists of a device to prevent contact with exposed energized electrical conductors during electrical maintenance. In 2018, JLL was granted another patent, Blackbird (sm), a geospatial intelligence tool. We also have a number of pending United States patent applications to further enable us to provide high levels of client service and operational excellence. Our products that have pending patent applications include CRC Website, a cities comparison tool, and Sign and Ladder safety, as examples. We will continue to file additional patent applications on new inventions, as appropriate, demonstrating our commitment to technology and innovation.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; CODE OF BUSINESS ETHICS; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY AND RELATED MATTERS
We are committed to the values of effective corporate governance, operating our business to the highest ethical standards and conducting ourselves in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. We believe that these values promote the best long-term performance of JLL for the benefit of our shareholders, clients, staff and other constituencies.
Corporate Governance. We believe our policies and practices reflect corporate governance initiatives that comply with:

• | The listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), on which our Common Stock is traded


• | The corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002, as currently in effect


• | U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations


• | The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as currently in effect


• | The General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland, where we are incorporated

Our Board of Directors ("the Board") regularly reviews corporate governance developments and modifies our By-Laws, Guidelines and Committee Charters accordingly. As a result, we have adopted the following corporate governance policies and approaches that are considered to be best practices in corporate governance.

• | Annual elections of all members of our Board


• | Annual "say on pay" votes by shareholders with respect to executive compensation


• | Right of shareholders owning 30% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock to call a special meeting of shareholders for any purpose


• | Majority voting in Director elections


• | Separation of Chairman and CEO roles, with the Chairman serving as Lead Independent Director


• | Required approval by the Nominating and Governance Committee of any related-party transactions


• | Executive session among the Non-Executive Directors at each in-person meeting


• | Annual self-assessment by the Board and each of its Committees


• | Periodic assessment by our senior executive management of the operation of our Board

Code of Business Ethics. The ethics principles that guide our operations globally are embodied in our Code of Business Ethics, which applies to all employees of JLL, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Global Controller and the members of our Board. The Code of Business Ethics is the cornerstone of our Ethics Everywhere Program, by which we establish, communicate and monitor the overall elements of our efforts. We are proud of, and are determined to protect and enhance, the global reputation we have established since, in a service business such as ours, the integrity that our brand represents is one of our most valuable assets. For a number of years we have applied for and received Ethics Inside™ certification from NYSE Governance Services, a leading organization dedicated to best practices in ethics, compliance, corporate governance and citizenship. We believe it is the only available independent verification of a company's ethics program. As previously noted, we were named to Ethisphere Institute’s list of the World's Most Ethical Companies for the eleventh consecutive time in 2018. We also were recertified under the Ethics Inside program by the Ethisphere Institute.
We support the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investing and, given that our clients include a number of the major companies within the electronic industry, the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct. We are also a member of the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative sponsored by the World Economic Forum.
Vendor Code of Conduct. We expect each of our vendors, meaning any firm or individual providing a product or service to us, or indirectly to our clients as a contractor or subcontractor, will share and embrace the letter and spirit of our commitment to integrity. While vendors are independent entities, their business practices may significantly reflect upon us, our reputation and our brand. Accordingly, we expect all vendors to adhere to the JLL Vendor Code of Conduct, which we publish in multiple languages on our website. We continue to evaluate and implement new ways to monitor the quality and integrity of our supply chain, including developing means to efficiently survey and compare responses about the ethical environment and riskiness of current and potential suppliers that we engage both for our own company and on behalf of clients.
Professional Standards Guide. Our guide to professional standards seeks to establish principles under which our people will perform services for clients. It is published on our website.
29

Corporate Sustainability. We encourage and promote the principles of sustainability everywhere we operate, seeking to improve the communities and environment in which our people work and live. We design our corporate policies to reflect the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency, and we hold ourselves responsible for our social, environmental and economic performance. We seek to incorporate sustainability practices and principles into our client investments and asset management. These priorities guide the interactions we have with our shareholders, clients, employees, regulators and vendors, as well as with all others with whom we come into contact. We recognize both the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and seek to address these impacts both in and beyond our business.
We also work to foster an environment that values the richness of our differences and reflects the diverse world in which we live and work. By cultivating a dynamic mix of people and ideas, we enrich our performance, the communities in which we operate, and the lives of our employees. We seek to recruit a diverse workforce, develop and promote exceptional talent from diverse backgrounds, and embrace the varied experiences of all our employees.
Corporate Political Activities. Given the diversity of our clients, shareholders, staff and other constituencies, our general approach is to not take positions as an organization on social or political issues or on political campaigns. Accordingly, our use of corporate funds or other resources for political activities has been negligible. From time to time, we may comment on proposed legislation or regulations that directly affect our business interests and therefore the interests of our shareholders. We may also belong to industry trade associations that do become involved in attempts to influence legislation in the interests of the industry generally.
Conflicts Minerals. Since we are not a manufacturer, nor do we contract to manufacture, we do not believe that we engage in the purchase or procurement of conflicts minerals, either for ourselves or our clients.
