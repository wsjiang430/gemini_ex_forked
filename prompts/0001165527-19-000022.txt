History and Evolution of Trident Brands
 
Trident Brands Incorporated was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 5, 2007 as Sandfield Ventures Corp. Its primary business was resource exploration in that state but after a period of time management of the Company decided to take a new direction for the business and focus on consumer goods with a focus on nutritional products and ingredients.  We are currently in the product introduction and commercialization phase of this business focus.
 
On June 12, 2013 the Board of Directors approved an agreement and plan of merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary called Trident Brands Incorporated.  At that point we changed our name from Sandfield Ventures Corp. to Trident Brands Incorporated and Mark Holcombe assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer.
 
Following that, on July 9, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a resolution to affect a 4 for 1 forward stock split. Upon effect of the forward split, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 300,000,000 shares of common stock and correspondingly, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock increased from 7,000,000 to 28,000,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001
 
On August 1, 2013, our directors approved the adoption of our 2013 Stock Option Plan which permits us to issue up to 4,200,000 shares of our common stock to directors, officers, employees and consultants of our company upon the exercise of stock options granted under the 2013 Stock Option Plan.
 
On December 23, 2013, we signed a 15 year license agreement (including a ten year extension option) with Everlast® World’s Boxing Headquarters Corp., International Brand Management & Licensing, to market and sell products in the nutritional foods and supplements category under the Everlast® brand. This licensing agreement enables us to introduce a portfolio of nutritional products in categories such as supplements and functional foods using this brand mark.
 
On March 21, 2014, we appointed the following individuals as officers and directors:

We  received the funds from the transaction in two tranches, $1,800,000 on February 5, 2015 and $500,000 on May 14, 2015.

In order to maintain exclusivity to the license, we are required to meet certain targets with respect to product launches and sales volume.

Human Resources, Contract Service Providers, Employees
 
We operate our business via resources that provide services to the Company on a contractual basis.  We feel this is most prudent as we can cost effectively meet our needs and leverage capabilities of talented individuals without employing on a full time basis.  As the business grows we expect to add a number of full-time employees.  We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. Except for our stock option plan, there are presently no personal benefits available to our officers and directors.
Reports to Securities Holders
 
We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders.  We will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules of Regulation S-K for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  We are subject to disclosure filing requirements, including filing Form 10K annually and Form 10Q quarterly.  In addition, we will file Form 8K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required.  We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act.  The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, ("SEC"), at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549.  The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.  The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
