ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Sharing Services Global Corporation (“Sharing Services”, “SHRG”, or “the Company”), a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on April 24, 2015. Sharing Services is a diversified holding company, with Elepreneurs Holdings, a direct selling company, and Elevacity Holdings, a products company, being its primary operating subsidiaries. Elepreneurs markets and distributes health and wellness products that are sold under the Elevate brand through an independent sales force of distributors, or Elepreneurs. The Company’s management team, and business partners and consultants, include industry leaders with extensive experience in the direct selling industry, as well as expertise in our product offerings.
 
In the future, the Company intends to develop and market additional product offerings. These additional offerings will allow the Company to combine products, services, and non-traditional compensation methods to create a unique GIG Economy Opportunity.
 
Our History
 
Sharing Services, Inc. was originally formed in 2015 to develop and market two web applications (“web apps”) but soon expanded its business model to develop and market a wide range of health and wellness products. The Company achieved this and brought the Elevate brand to the market by launching its Elepreneurs and Elevacity subsidiaries in 2017.
 
In May 2017, the Company acquired Total Travel Media, Inc. (“Total Travel Media” or “TTM”) and, in September 2017, it acquired Four Oceans Holdings, Inc. (“Four Oceans”). Both Total Travel Media and Four Oceans are engaged in developing, marketing and selling technology, training, media and travel products. During the year 2017, the Company also acquired minority equity interests in several entities engaged in the development of online marketing and direct sales software systems, travel products, health benefit services, and consumer insurance products.
 
Products
 
In December 2017, the Company launched its current health and wellness product line under the name Elevate to bring health and wellness products to the marketplace. The Company’s Elevate product line consists of Nutraceutical products. The Company refers to is core product as “D.O.S.E.” (which stands for: Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin and Endorphins). The launch of this product line accelerated the Company’s growth and has enabled the Company to expand its sales volume and operations at a rapid pace.
Recent Corporate Name Change
 
As disclosed earlier, in January 2019, Sharing Services, Inc. changed its corporate name to Sharing Services Global Corporation to better reflect the Company’s strategic intent to grow its business globally. The corporate name change was approved by the Company’s shareholders and by its Board. In connection with the name change, the Company adopted the trading symbol SHRG effective April 4, 2019. Prior to this the Company’s common stock traded under the symbol SHRV.
Future Acquisitions
 
The Company has plans to expand its products offerings in order to further grow its sales volume and achieve sustained profitability through the continued focus on its growth strategy. This growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions which the Company intends to make, subject to the approval of its Board, to augment its product portfolio and complement its business competencies.
Industry and Business Trends
 
The Company believes the following industry and business trends will influence the direct selling industry and provide it with opportunities to grow its business and achieve positive financial results in the near future:

● | Interest in direct selling has been growing in recent years. For example, in 2011, there were 15.6 million people involved in direct selling in the U.S. and, by 2017, that number had increased to 18.6 million, an increase of 19.2%, according to “Direct Selling in the United States: 2017 Facts and Data” published by the Direct Selling Association (“DSA”); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Consumer attitudes to direct selling are favorable. For example, results of a consumer attitude survey released by the DSA in 2017 show that over 80% of consumers gave the direct selling industry a neutral or highly favorable rating and over 50% of the respondents reported that they are “likely to purchase from a direct selling representative in the next 12 months;” 
● | A high percentage (58%) of people involved in direct selling earn an annual income of over $50,000, according to the DSA;

● | Independent contractors prioritize (i) being one’s own boss, (ii) flexibility in work schedule and (iii) having a better work-life balance, according to Bloomberg. With these factors in mind, more than three-quarters of independent contractor’s report being highly satisfied with their job; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The level of interest in the industry is higher in younger sectors of the population. For example, approximately 75% of the people involved in direct selling in 2018 were millennials and generation Xers (Americans between the ages of 20 and 54 years old), according to “Direct Selling in the United States: 2018 Industry Overview” published by the DSA, while estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that millennials and generation Xers were only about 46% of the estimated overall U.S. population; 
● | Participation in the industry by women is high. For example, approximately 75% of the people involved in direct selling in 2018 were women, also according to the DSA, while estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that women made up about 51% of the estimated overall U.S. population; 
● | From 2011 to 2018, the total value of retail sales by the direct selling industry in the U.S. grew from $29.9 billion to $35.4 billion, an increase of 18.4%, according to the DSA; and 
● | The largest sector in the industry, wellness products (such as those in our Elevate product line), accounted for 35.6% of total retail sales by the industry (or approximately $12.6 billion) in 2018, according to the DSA. 

Business Segments, Geographic Area Information and Seasonality
 
The information in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 — “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference.
 
In each of the two fiscal years in the period ended April 30, 2019, approximately 97% of the Company’s consolidated net sales were from the sale of its Elevate health and wellness product line. In the fiscal year 2019 and 2018, approximately 96% and 99%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales were to customers located in the United States. The direct selling industry is normally impacted adversely during the third calendar quarter, when many individuals traditionally take vacations.
 
Competition
 
The direct selling industry is large and growing, highly competitive and dynamic, and there are few barriers to entering the industry. We compete with other direct selling organizations, many of which have a longer operating history, higher visibility, name recognition and with more financial resources than we do. These leading network marketing companies include Amway Corporation, Avon Products, Herbalife, Mary Kay and NuSkin Enterprises. We compete with these companies to attract and retain our independent sales distributors (Elepreneurs) on the strength of our product line, leadership training, compensation plan, marketing focus, corporate values and management leadership strengths.
 
The marketplace for health and wellness products is highly competitive. Our competitors include wide range of marketers from traditional retails stores both “brick and mortar” and online to other network marketing companies. We compete in this marketplace by emphasizing differentiators such as our exclusive access to unique products and ingredients, the quality and efficacy of our products, and the reliability and convenience of our distribution system and customer service experience. We offer products and services that aim to improve health, wealth and happiness of our distributors and customers, rather than one specific product line or service like many companies focus on.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and will help drive our future growth:
 

● | Our Elevate nutraceuticals (D.O.S.E. and other proprietary products) are sourced through exclusive strategic partnerships, and are not available through traditional sales channels; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our technology-driven marketing initiatives, which emphasize the nutritional value and/or other health benefits of our health and wellness product line; and 
● | Our ability to offer our industry-exclusive brands directly to consumers, through our independent, entrepreneurial sales force.

Elevate Product Brand
 
One of our key goals is and has been to empower the health-conscious global community with an emphasis on health and happiness. Consistent with this objective, in mid-December 2017, we launched our Elevate product line, an innovative line of health and wellness products marketed and distributed exclusively through our independent sales force of distributors. In the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, we had consolidated net sales of $85.9 million and $8.4 million, respectively, with approximately 97% resulting from the sale of our Elevate health and wellness product line.

Sales and Marketing
 
We rely on a direct selling model consisting of independent sales representatives, or Elepreneurs, and customer referrals to promote and sell our products. This is an effective selling model as our Elepreneurs are able to: personally educate consumers about our products, provide testimonials and provide higher levels of customer support.
 
We provide support to these marketers with marketing content, websites, events and through technology. We offer our products online and provide each Elepreneur with a virtual online Back Office website. This website is where Elepreneurs can manage, monitor, and operate their businesses 24 hours a day from any location.
 
Product Distribution
 
Distribution to our individual customers and distributors located throughout the United States and Canada is primarily handled by an independent logistics partner located in Addison, Texas. We also operate an internal smaller fulfillment center near our corporate headquarters. This allows the Company to improve our product distribution and delivery while capitalizing on cost savings and efficiencies. We intend to grow, in part, by offering and distributing our products to customers in other geographies.
Customers and Independent Distributors
 
The Company distributes its products through two basic groups: (1) our customers- individuals who buy our products from a distributor for personal consumption and (2) our distributors- individuals who buy product for personal consumption and for resale and who also recruit and train new sellers. The Company’s goal is to monitor and develop both of these groups using different strategies. To grow our customer base, we offer high-quality unique products. Our strategy for growing our independent sales force is to provide a meaningful business opportunity to them through sales compensations, incentives and bonuses.
 
Any person may join the Company as a distributor, or Elepreneur, by purchasing a Virtual Business System (“VBS”) for $99.00 USD. This kit includes the training and basic marketing materials which better enables our sales force to sell our products and build their organization. Elepreneurs may then purchase products for personal use or to build their sales organization. No product purchases are required upon enrollment.
 
Elepreneurs Agreement
 
Elepreneurs are independent contractors and the Company does not direct or control their efforts, but we do require them to abide by our policies and procedures as well as any applicable laws and regulations. To become a distributor an individual must affirmatively accept a standard Elepreneurs Agreement as well as Elepreneur Policies and Procedures. These documents govern the relationship between the Company and each Elepreneur. The Policies and Procedures outline the scope of permissible marketing activities and the Elepreneurs Agreement defines the relationship between the distributor and the Company. We require Elepreneurs to present our products as well as the business opportunity both ethically and professionally.
Compensation Plan
 
We believe that our Compensation Plan offers to our Elepreneurs an exciting and effective way to earn commissions. All of our Elepreneurs are independent businesspersons and earn commissions as they sell our products to their personal customers. Additionally, they can earn commissions as their own personally enrolled Elepreneurs sell products. There is no limit as to the number of personally enrolled Elepreneurs or customers that an Elepreneur may have.
 
Each Elepreneur begins by purchasing a Virtual Business System or VBS for $99.00 USD. This kit includes the training and basic marketing materials which better enables our sales force to sell our products and build their organization. No commissions or bonuses are paid for enrolling other Elepreneurs.
 
Additionally, each month our top producing Elepreneurs may also earn commission based on the sales levels achieved by such Elepreneur and his/her downline. This bonus commission is designed to compensate them for mentoring, training and developing other Elepreneurs in their downline.
 
The “Plan” emphasizes customer acquisition and retention. The company provides a back-office web-site for our Elepreneurs to use in their ecommerce sales, but an affiliate may also sell directly to their customers.
 
We rely upon the affiliates to create customer demand and sales. We feel our plan is successful in helping to attract and motivate our sales force and key industry leaders.
 
Trademarks, Patents and Intellectual Property
 
The Company currently has six (6) trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and has applied for or intends to apply for additional trademark protection in the United States and in other countries where it currently does business or intends to do business in the future. The Company anticipates securing multiple U.S. trademarks and foreign trademarks in the future. In the event we expand our operations in international jurisdictions, trademark protection is increasingly important for brand recognition and protection, as well as for Elepreneurs and consumer loyalty.

Several of our products utilize proprietary formulations and processes. Although we do not directly hold any patents currently, some of our key vendors have secured or applied for patents to maintain exclusivity for the ingredients or integrated products they supply to us. To protect our own intellectual property and proprietary processes that are material to the long-term health and profitability of the Company, we maintain disciplined business practices to manage trade secrets and use various forms of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.
 
We consider trademark protection to be very important to our business and utilize an internal compliance team to closely monitor the usage of our intellectual property. Please see ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS below for more information about the Company’s intellectual property.
 
Strategic Partnerships
 
We maintain good relationships with our key business partners to ensure the continuous supply, distribution, and quality of our products.
 
To date, we have relied primarily on three suppliers for our product purchases. Purchases from one of these suppliers accounted for 96% and 92% of the Company’s total product purchases in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
Our main distribution center is operated by a third-party logistics partner. We also operate a smaller fulfillment center located near our corporate headquarters from where we ship certain sales orders. Under the terms of its third-party product distribution agreement, the Company, in its sole discretion, may process some or all its sales orders internally or using other logistic partners in the future.
 
Regulatory Environment
 
Our business is regulated by various federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States and by similar agencies in foreign markets. These laws and regulations relate to: (1) the manufacturing, labeling, distribution and sale of our products; (2) product claims and advertising; and (3) our network marketing program.
Direct Selling Activities
 
In the United States, direct selling programs are subject to a variety of federal and state regulations governed by the FTC. These regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive practices involving sales to consumers. They also ensure that product sales are made to the ultimate consumers and that compensation within the organization is made based upon sales rather than recruitment into the organization.
 
The company monitors and, if necessary, responds to regulatory developments that may affect our network marketing program. Please see Risk Factors below for more information about our exposure to existing and potentially new laws and regulations. We believe the Company is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to direct selling activities in the United States and other countries where we operate. Please see ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS below for more information about our exposure to existing and potentially new laws and regulations.
 
Regulation of Personal Care and Nutritional Food Products
 
Our products and certain related marketing and advertising practices are subject to governmental regulation by various federal, state and local government agencies and authorities in the U.S. and Canada, and in other jurisdictions where we operate or intend to operate in the future. These agencies and authorities include the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture and State Attorneys General. To date, we have not experienced any governmental actions related to health or safety, or food and drug regulations regarding our products.
 
The FDA regulates both finished dietary supplement products (including certain of our health and wellness products) and dietary ingredients. Dietary supplements are specifically regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the DSHEA). Under the DSHEA, manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements are prohibited from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. Accordingly, under the DSHEA, manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements are responsible for the safety and labeling of their products prior to such products reaching the market. Unlike medications, dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, such as those sold by the Company, do not require FDA approval before such products can be marketed and sold.
 
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which enforces consumer protection laws regarding truth in advertising, regulates how we advertise and market our products. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission seeks to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injuries or death associated with consumer products.

In the U.S. and Canada, our products are also subject to laws and regulations concerning product formulation, labeling and packaging. These laws and regulations often require us to, among other things, conform product labeling to local language and content requirements, register or qualify the products with the applicable government authorities, or obtain approvals or file required notifications prior to marketing such products. Many of the jurisdictions where we operate also regulate product capability claims and advertising content. These regulations control the type of claims and representations that can be made regarding the capabilities of products. For example, in the United States, it is unlawful to make claims that nutritional products will help diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease.
 
Employees
 
As of April 30, 2019, we had approximately 66 full-time employees, 30 of which provide direct support to our Elepreneurs and customers. This number does not include approximately 20,000 distributors who are independent contractors. Our employees are not represented by labor unions. We believe that our relationship with our employees is positive, and we do expect a shortage in qualified personnel to continue our business growth.
Access to Public Filings
 
Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to such reports, are available to any person, without charge, upon written request to our Investor Relations Department at 1700 Coit Road, Suite 100, Plano, Texas 75075.
