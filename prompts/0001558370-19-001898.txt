 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview

Trevena, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative treatment options that target and treat diseases affecting the central nervous system, or CNS. Unless the context otherwise requires, we use the terms “Trevena,” “company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to Trevena, Inc.
 Using our proprietary product platform, we have identified and are developing the following product candidates:

· | Oliceridine injection: We are developing oliceridine, a G protein biased mu-opioid receptor, or MOR, ligand, for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in hospitals or other controlled clinical settings where intravenous, or IV, administration of opioids is warranted. We have completed two pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies (APOLLO 1 and APOLLO 2) of oliceridine in moderate-to-severe acute pain following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty, respectively. In both studies, all dose regimens achieved their primary endpoint of statistically greater analgesic efficacy than placebo, as measured by responder rate. We also have completed a Phase 3 open-label safety study (ATHENA) in which 768 patients were administered oliceridine to manage pain associated with a wide range of procedures and diagnoses. In late 2017, we submitted the oliceridine new drug application, or NDA, to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. On November 2, 2018, the FDA issued a complete response letter, or CRL, with respect to our NDA for oliceridine. In the CRL, the FDA requested additional clinical data on the QT interval and indicated that the submitted safety database was not of adequate size for the proposed labeling. The FDA also requested certain additional nonclinical data and validation reports. On January 28, 2019, we announced the receipt of the official Type A meeting minutes from the FDA regarding the CRL wherein the FDA agreed that our current safety database will support labeling at a maximum daily dose of 27 mg. The FDA also agreed that we can conduct a study in healthy volunteers to collect the requested QT interval data and that the study should include placebo- and positive-control arms. We have submitted a detailed protocol and analysis plan to the FDA and, following receipt of FDA feedback, anticipate initiating the study in the first half of 2019. To address remaining items in the CRL, the FDA indicated that we should include supporting nonclinical data related to the characterization of the 9662 metabolite and the remaining product validation reports when we resubmit the oliceridine NDA.

· | TRV250: We are developing TRV250, a G protein biased delta-opioid receptor, or DOR, as a compound with a potential first-in-class, novel mechanism for the treatment of acute migraine. TRV250 also may have utility in a range of other CNS indications. Because TRV250 selectively targets the DOR, we believe it will not have the addiction liability of conventional opioids or have other mu-opioid related adverse effects like those seen with morphine or oxycodone. In June 2018, we announced the successful completion of our first-in-human Phase 1 study of TRV250. Data from this healthy volunteer study showed safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics supporting the advancement of TRV250 to Phase 2 proof of concept evaluation in patients.

· | TRV734: We also have identified and have completed the initial Phase 1 studies for TRV734, a new chemical entity, or NCE, targeting the same novel mechanism of action at the MOR as oliceridine. TRV734 was designed to be orally available, and its mechanism of action suggests it may offer valuable benefits for two distinct areas of important unmet medical need: acute and chronic pain, and maintenance therapy for patients with opioid use disorder. We are collaborating with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA, to further evaluate TRV734 for the management of opioid use disorder. We intend to continue to focus our efforts for TRV734 on securing a development and commercialization partner for this asset.

  We also are evaluating a set of novel S1P modulators that may offer a new, non-opioid approach to managing chronic pain. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we identified a new product candidate, TRV045, a novel S1P modulator that

we believe may offer a new, non-opioid approach to managing chronic pain. We anticipate beginning investigational new drug, or IND, enabling work in 2019, and we will continue to evaluate the progression of this asset to an IND, either by ourselves or with a partner.
 Our Pipeline 

 Oliceridine Injection
 Oliceridine is a G protein biased MOR ligand in development for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in hospitals or other controlled clinical settings where IV opioid therapy is warranted. It is an NCE with a novel mechanism of action at the MOR that enables more selective targeting of newly discovered pathways with the potential for fewer side effects.
 Disease and treatment options
 The typical treatment paradigm in the United States for the management of moderate‑to‑severe acute pain is to initiate injectable (IV) pain medication in the preoperative or immediate postoperative period to provide rapid and effective pain relief. Conventional IV opioid analgesics, such as morphine, fentanyl, and hydromorphone, have been core components of pain management protocols in the immediate postoperative period. The clinical effectiveness of conventional opioid agonists is limited by severe dose dependent side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and constipation, which can be exacerbated by accumulation of active metabolites and by reduced renal clearance in patients with impaired kidney function. Currently available IV opioid options offer either fast onset with short duration of action (e.g. IV fentanyl), or slower onset with longer duration (e.g. IV morphine). These pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, or PK/PD, profiles create some practical challenges for healthcare providers in certain clinical practice situations.
 Injectable non‑opioid analgesics are often used together with IV opioids in so-called multimodal protocols for post‑surgical pain management; however, these drugs, such as IV non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, IV acetaminophen, or local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, have their own potential for cardiovascular, hepatic and gastrointestinal side effects. In addition, none of these non‑opioid analgesic approaches offers great enough efficacy to manage severe acute pain as a monotherapy in many patients. We believe that there remains significant unmet need for a highly effective IV opioid analgesic agent with an improved safety, tolerability, and/or PK/PD profile.
 Clinical development
 We are developing oliceridine for the management of moderate‑to‑severe acute pain in hospitals or other controlled clinical settings where IV administration is warranted. In the future, we also may explore other formulations, such as transmucosal administration for breakthrough pain in additional, separate clinical trials. 
 Below is a summary of the clinical development work undertaken for oliceridine.

 ATHENA Phase 3 Open Label Safety Study
 We conducted a Phase 3, open label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of oliceridine in patients with moderate-to-severe pain caused by surgery or medical conditions. The trial was designed to model real-world use, including the use of multi-modal analgesia. Patients were treated with oliceridine on an as-needed basis via IV bolus, patient-controlled analgesia, or PCA, or both, as determined by the investigator. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of oliceridine. Pain intensity was measured as a secondary endpoint.
 In the ATHENA study, 768 patients were treated with oliceridine. The most common procedures were orthopedic, gynecologic, colorectal, and general surgeries. Patients at elevated risk of opioid-related adverse events were well represented; more than 30% of patients were 65 years or older, and approximately 50% of patients were obese, with body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2. Only 2% of patients discontinued for adverse events, and 4% of patients discontinued for lack of efficacy. The most common adverse events were nausea, constipation, and vomiting, with prevalence lower than in the APOLLO studies. Adverse event rates associated with oliceridine administered by PCA and as-needed bolus dosing were similar, supporting the potential use of oliceridine in both administration paradigms.
 APOLLO 1 and APOLLO 2 Phase 3 Studies
 We have conducted two pivotal efficacy trials evaluating oliceridine in patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain: the APOLLO 1 study, which evaluated pain for 48 hours following bunionectomy, and the APOLLO 2 study, which evaluated pain for 24 hours following abdominoplasty. In February 2017, we announced positive top line results from the APOLLO 1 and APOLLO 2 studies. In both studies, all dose regimens achieved the primary endpoint of statistically greater analgesic efficacy than placebo, as measured by responder rate.
 The APOLLO 1 and APOLLO 2 studies were both Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled studies of oliceridine. During the study period, a loading dose of placebo, morphine (4 mg), or oliceridine (1.5 mg) was administered first, and then patients used a PCA button to dose themselves as often as every 6 minutes with the same study drug: 1 mg morphine, or 0.1 mg, 0.35 mg, or 0.5 mg oliceridine. If PCA dosing was inadequate to control pain, patients could request supplemental study medication (2 mg morphine or 0.75 mg oliceridine, no more than once an hour). If the study medication regimen did not adequately manage pain, patients could opt for an NSAID rescue analgesic. Placebo loading, demand, and supplemental doses were volume-matched.
 All endpoints were the same in both studies, except that dosing and pain assessment were for 48 hours in APOLLO 1 and 24 hours in APOLLO 2. Efficacy was measured by a responder analysis, which defined a responder as a patient who experienced at least a 30% reduction in their sum of pain intensity difference at the end of the treatment period without either early discontinuation (for lack of efficacy or safety/tolerability) or use of rescue medication. Non-inferior efficacy compared to morphine and superior efficacy compared to morphine were key secondary endpoints. Respiratory safety events were defined as clinically relevant worsening of respiratory status, including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, or sedation. The product of the frequency and conditional duration of these events was reported as respiratory safety burden, a key secondary endpoint. Additional measures of respiratory safety included prevalence of oxygen saturation less than 90% and prevalence of supplemental oxygen use. Measures of gastrointestinal tolerability included use of rescue antiemetics, vomiting, and spontaneously reported nausea.
 APOLLO 1 (bunionectomy)

· | All three oliceridine regimens (0.1 mg, 0.35 mg, and 0.5 mg on-demand doses) achieved the primary endpoint with statistically superior responder rates compared to placebo at 48 hours (p<0.0001, adjusted for multiplicity).

  In both studies, oliceridine was generally well-tolerated. The most common drug-related adverse events were nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness.
 Phase 2b trial of oliceridine in acute postoperative pain following abdominoplasty 
 The aim of our Phase 2b clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oliceridine in the management of postoperative pain using morphine as a benchmark, utilizing on demand dosing to reflect standard clinical practice. This Phase 2b trial was a randomized, double blind, placebo and active controlled trial of oliceridine in which we enrolled 200 patients with moderate-to-severe acute postoperative pain after abdominoplasty surgery. Two regimens of oliceridine were tested: the first consisted of a 1.5 mg intravenous loading dose with 0.1 mg self-administered on demand doses as often as every six minutes using a PCA device; the second consisted of a 1.5 mg loading dose with 0.35 mg on demand doses as often as every six minutes using a PCA device. A commonly used morphine PCA regimen also was tested, consisting of a 4 mg loading dose with 1 mg on demand doses as often as every six minutes. Placebo was administered as a loading dose and on demand doses were volume matched to the active regimens. Rescue medication consisting of ibuprofen or oxycodone was used in all groups.

 In August 2015, we reported top line results from this trial. Oliceridine demonstrated statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo and comparable efficacy to morphine. Oliceridine provided rapid reduction in average pain scores, consistent with the previous Phase 2 trial where oliceridine showed more rapid onset of meaningful pain relief than morphine. Rescue analgesic use was similar for both oliceridine and morphine, and less than half the rate of rescue analgesic use for placebo. In this study, the oliceridine groups had a significantly lower prevalence (percentage of patients) of hypoventilation events (a measure of respiratory safety), nausea, and vomiting than the morphine group. The most frequently reported adverse events, associated with oliceridine were nausea, vomiting, hypoventilation and headache. Opioid related adverse events were generally less frequent in the oliceridine groups compared to morphine. No drug related serious adverse events were reported in the study.
 Phase 2a/b trial of oliceridine in acute postoperative pain following bunionectomy
 The aim of our Phase 2a/b clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of oliceridine in the management of postoperative pain using morphine as a benchmark, using fixed dose and dose interval to characterize the performance of oliceridine. The trial was a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo and active controlled, multiple dose, adaptive trial in 333 women and men undergoing a primary unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy surgery at four sites in the United States. Patients were randomized after surgery to receive oliceridine, morphine or placebo to manage their pain. Pain intensity was measured using validated numeric rating scales ranging from ten (most severe pain) to zero (no pain) at multiple time points up to 48 hours. Based on these scales, analgesic efficacy was assessed with a time weighted average change in pain score over 48 hours—a well-established measure of changes in the intensity of pain over time and an FDA recommended endpoint for pain studies.
 In November 2014, we announced top line data from this trial. At doses of 2 mg and 3 mg of oliceridine administered every three hours, the trial achieved its primary endpoint of statistically greater pain reduction than placebo for 48 hours, which we believe demonstrated proof of concept for oliceridine. Over the 48-hour trial period, the 3 mg dose of oliceridine administered every three hours also showed statistically superior analgesic efficacy compared to the 4 mg dose of morphine administered every four hours. Additionally, in the first three hours of dosing, when pain was most severe, the 1 mg, 2 mg, and 3 mg doses of oliceridine demonstrated superior analgesic efficacy in the trial compared to placebo, and the 2 mg, and 3 mg doses of oliceridine demonstrated superior analgesic efficacy compared to the 4 mg dose of morphine.
 There were no serious adverse events reported in the trial. Both the 2 mg and 3 mg doses of oliceridine showed overall tolerability over the 48-hour trial period similar to that of the 4 mg dose of morphine administered every four hours. The most frequently reported adverse events associated with oliceridine were dizziness, headache, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, flushing and itching. Adverse effects were generally dose related.
 Phase 1 clinical studies of oliceridine
 We also have completed a number of Phase 1 clinical studies of oliceridine. These included two single ascending dose studies of oliceridine given as a 60-minute continuous infusion or a 2-minute bolus infusion that showed dose related increases in plasma exposure and pupil constriction, a biomarker for CNS opioid activity across a range of doses that were generally well tolerated.
 In 2013, we completed a Phase 1b proof of concept exploratory trial in healthy male subjects. The aims of this trial were to characterize the analgesic efficacy and safety and tolerability of a single dose of oliceridine as compared to a single 10 mg dose of morphine. We used a well-established evoked pain model, the cold pain test, to evaluate the analgesic effects of oliceridine by measuring the time to hand removal, or latency, from a temperature controlled cold water bath. At both the 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg doses, oliceridine showed superior efficacy as compared to a 10 mg morphine dose that was statistically significant with a p value of less than 0.05 at the ten- and thirty-minute time points after dosing. The durability of the analgesic effect was similar to morphine. In addition, the time to peak effect was more rapid than that for morphine. Overall, oliceridine was well tolerated in the trial. Subjects receiving oliceridine showed less severe nausea and less frequent vomiting at the 1.5 mg and 3.0 mg doses as compared to a 10 mg dose of morphine. Oliceridine also showed less respiratory depression compared to morphine over 4 hours.

 In October 2014 we completed an adaptive, multiple ascending dose study of oliceridine in more than 50 healthy subjects. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics results of this study were consistent with the early Phase 1 studies described above. Recently, we also successfully completed an absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion study, with results consistent with the lack of known active oliceridine metabolites. We also completed a thorough QT study, a renal impairment study which showed no evidence of altered PK/accumulation in patients with renal failure compared to healthy patients, and a human abuse liability study which showed that oliceridine had similar abuse liability as IV morphine when administered at a comparably analgesic dose. In addition, we have completed a study in patients with underlying hepatic impairment, which showed that less frequent oliceridine dosing may be required in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
 Regulatory
 In late 2017, we submitted the NDA for oliceridine to the FDA and on November 2, 2018, the FDA issued a CRL related to the NDA. In the CRL, the FDA requested additional clinical data on the QT interval and indicated that the submitted safety database was not of adequate size for the proposed labeling at a maximum daily dose of 40 mg. The FDA also requested certain additional nonclinical data and validation reports. On January 28, 2019, we announced the receipt of the official Type A meeting minutes from the FDA regarding the CRL wherein the FDA agreed that the submitted safety database will support labeling at a maximum daily dose of 27 mg. The FDA also agreed that we can conduct a study in healthy volunteers to collect the requested QT interval data and that the study should include placebo- and positive-control arms. We have submitted a detailed protocol and statistical analysis plan to the FDA for the healthy volunteer study and, following receipt of FDA feedback, anticipate initiating the study in the first half of 2019. To address remaining items in the CRL, the FDA indicated that we should include supporting nonclinical data related to the characterization of the 9662 metabolite and the remaining product validation reports when we resubmit the oliceridine NDA. 
 In December 2015, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to oliceridine for the management of moderate to severe acute pain. The Fast Track program is designed to facilitate the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious conditions with unmet medical needs by providing sponsors with the opportunity for frequent interactions with the FDA. 
 In February 2016, based on the preliminary evidence from our Phase 2 clinical studies of oliceridine, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to oliceridine for the management of moderate to severe acute pain. Breakthrough Therapy designation is granted by the FDA to new therapies intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial clinical improvement over available therapies. If granted, the FDA regularly reviews the Breakthrough Therapy designation for a product candidate to ensure that any additional clinical evidence continues to support this designation. In March 2019, based on its review of data from the Company’s Phase 3 studies of oliceridine, the FDA informed Trevena that under the conditions studied, these data were not sufficient to support the continuation of the FDA’s previously granted Breakthrough Therapy designation. The Company does not expect the absence of Breakthrough Therapy designation to impact the timing of the FDA’s review of the oliceridine new drug application following resubmission. 
     Commercialization
 According to 2017 IQVIA hospital charge detail data, approximately 45 million patients in the United States were treated with an IV opioid in the hospital setting. The majority of doses of IV opioids administered were in the inpatient setting where approximately 15 million patients were treated with multiple doses for an average of one to two days. Patients treated in the hospital outpatient or ambulatory surgical centers may also receive one or two doses of IV opioids for postsurgical or medical pain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, has estimated that approximately 100 million surgical and invasive diagnostic procedures occur annually in the United States. Accordingly, if approved, we believe that there is a large potential commercial opportunity for oliceridine in the management of both surgical and medical acute pain in hospital and ambulatory surgical centers.

 If oliceridine ultimately receives regulatory approval, we plan to commercialize it in the United States, either on our own or with a commercial partner. Outside the United States, we expect to continue to seek collaborators to commercialize oliceridine to offset risk and preserve capital.
 To commercialize oliceridine in the United States, we intend to utilize a hospital-focused specialty sales force targeting surgeons, anesthesiologists, hospitalists, and other healthcare providers with acute post-surgical or medical pain management responsibility. While we believe that the greatest opportunity for oliceridine will ultimately be in the hospital inpatient setting where acute pain is typically more severe, the onset and duration of analgesia seen with oliceridine may be well suited to hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgical centers. Hospital trend data also indicates that ambulatory surgical procedures now outnumber and are growing faster than inpatient surgeries in the United States. Because many surgeons and anesthesiologists manage both inpatient and outpatient cases, we believe that early physician experiences with oliceridine in ambulatory surgery may support subsequent use in the inpatient setting.
 We estimate that approximately 50% of the 15 million IV opioid treated hospital inpatients may be at increased risk of opioid-related adverse events such as respiratory depression or post-operative nausea and vomiting. We believe that many of these patients are elderly and have comorbid conditions, driving inpatient surgical complexity and length of stay. Population and hospital trend data indicates that these patient groups will continue to grow and be an area of focus for inpatient care. Managing these patients and adverse events results in a significant cost burden to the hospital system. Given these changing dynamics in the hospital marketplace and the increased emphasis on clinical and economic outcomes, we expect our commercialization plans to include health economic information framing the budget impact of oliceridine through a potential reduction in the adverse events seen with conventional IV opioids in these patients.
 According to 2017 data from Symphony Health Solutions, approximately 1,200 U.S. hospitals are responsible for 70% of the annual volume of conventional IV opioid drugs prescribed. We expect to identify a subset of these hospitals that utilize high volumes of IV opioids in pain management and have rapidly adopted new branded analgesic agents in the past as the initial account targets for oliceridine at launch. We will work to secure Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee approval and subsequent utilization of oliceridine at these hospitals.
 Manufacturing
 We have completed process development of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and have manufactured multiple commercial scale batches using our proposed commercial process under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, conditions. We also have completed drug product process development and have manufactured multiple batches of drug product using the proposed commercial process under cGMP conditions.
 For oliceridine, we have established commercial supply agreements for the manufacture of the API and finished (compounded, filled and packaged) drug product. Alcami Corporation, or Alcami, is contracted to supply 100% of our commercial API from its Germantown, WI manufacturing facility. We have existing commercial supply agreements with two separate companies for the supply of drug product. Alcami is contracted to supply commercial drug product from its facilities in Charleston, SC and Wilmington, NC and was included as part of our NDA submission. Pfizer CentreOne (formerly Hospira) is also contracted to supply commercial drug product from its facility in McPherson, KS, but was not included in our NDA submission. If approved, we anticipate that oliceridine will be classified as a Schedule II controlled substance. All third-party facilities throughout the supply chain have the appropriate licenses from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, for handling Schedule II controlled substances according to each of their respective contractual roles (manufacturing, testing, distribution, etc.).
 Competition
 If oliceridine is approved for IV management of moderate-to-severe acute pain, it will compete with generic IV opioid analgesics, such as morphine, hydromorphone and fentanyl. The analgesic effectiveness of these agents is limited by well-known adverse side effects, such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and post-operative ileus, which can be exacerbated by the way these molecules are metabolized or cleared. Oliceridine also may compete against, or be used in combination with, OFIRMEV® (IV acetaminophen), marketed by Mallinckrodt plc, EXPAREL® (liposomal bupivacaine), marketed by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CALDOLOR® (IV ibuprofen), marketed by 

 
  10

 
Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, and DSUVIA™ (sublingual sufentanil) marketed by AcelRx. Together with generic versions of IV NSAIDs such as ketorolac, and generic versions of local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, these non-opioid analgesics are currently used in combination with opioids in the multimodal management of moderate-to-severe acute pain.
 We also are aware of a number of products in mid- and late-stage clinical development that are aimed at improving the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain and may compete with oliceridine. AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing ZALVISO™, a non-invasive PCA device containing sublingual sufentanil. Innocoll Holdings plc. and Heron Therapeutics Inc. have proprietary long acting reformulations of bupivacaine in development. Recro Pharma, Inc. is developing an IV version of the NSAID meloxicam. Cara Therapeutics Inc. is developing IV and oral dose forms of a peripherally restricted Κ opioid receptor agonist, which has been administered in combination with mu opioids in clinical trials. Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. is developing an IV version of generic opioid tramadol for moderate-to-severe acute pain.
 Intellectual property
 Our oliceridine patent portfolio is wholly owned by us. The portfolio includes four issued U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,835,488, 9,309,234, 9,642,842, and 9,849,119), which claim, among other things, oliceridine, compositions comprising oliceridine, and methods of using oliceridine. The issued patents are expected to expire no earlier than 2032, subject to any disclaimers or extensions, and any U.S. patent to issue in the future is also expected to expire no earlier than 2032, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. We also have issued patents in Australia, China, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, and New Zealand, which claim among other things, oliceridine, compositions comprising oliceridine and methods of making or using oliceridine. The foreign portfolio also includes an application that has been allowed by the European Patent Office, which claim among other things, oliceridine, compositions comprising oliceridine and methods of using oliceridine. We have patent applications pending in the United States, Europe, Japan, Israel, South Korea, Brazil, Canada, and India. The issued patents and patents that could issue in the future from these allowed or pending applications outside the United States are expected to expire no earlier than 2032, subject to any disclaimers or extensions.
 TRV250
 TRV250 is a G protein biased ligand targeting the delta receptor, with potential to be a first-in-class, novel mechanism for the treatment of acute migraine. We have completed a first-in-human Phase 1 trial of TRV250, which showed safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics supporting the advancement of TRV250 to Phase 2 proof of concept evaluation in patients. 
 Clinical development
 We believe our preclinical data support targeting the delta receptor for the treatment of CNS disorders. Prior approaches to modulate this receptor have been limited by a significant risk of seizure associated with this target. Preclinical studies in beta-arrestin knockout mice suggest that beta-arrestin plays a role in seizures. TRV250 is a potent delta receptor ligand that selectively activates G protein coupling without engaging beta arrestin, leading to strong efficacy in animal models of migraine and other CNS disorders with reduced seizure liability. In the future, we may decide to seek a collaborator for TRV250 with CNS development and commercialization expertise outside the United States.
 The Phase 1 study was a two part, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous and oral TRV250 in healthy adults. Part A assessed single subcutaneous doses in 38 subjects. Four cohorts of nine or ten subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of up to 30mg TRV250 or placebo. Part B consisted of a single cohort of nine subjects administered either TRV250 as a single 6 mg oral dose (either as a capsule in the fed state or a capsule in the fasted state, n=7) or placebo (as a capsule in the fed or fasted state, n=2).
 Key findings of the study included:

· | Dose-related increases in plasma concentrations following subcutaneous administration of doses up to 30 mg, with rapid absorption in the first hour and duration of exposure appropriate for treating acute migraine;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Subcutaneous doses at and above 9 mg achieved plasma concentrations that were active in preclinical models of migraine;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Oral bioavailability similar to existing migraine medications, supporting continued development of TRV250 in oral and/or subcutaneous formulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No observed drug-associated electroencephalography changes, consistent with preclinical studies in which TRV250 avoided the seizure liability associated with previous CNS-active delta receptor agonists; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No clinically significant changes in vital signs, laboratory values, or ECG parameters, and no severe or serious adverse events reported.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Based on the profile of TRV250, we believe it has the potential to be a first‑in‑class treatment option for treatment of migraine. According to Decision Resources, a healthcare consulting company, the acute migraine treatment market encompassed approximately 12 million drug‑treated patients in 2017 in the United States, representing approximately $1.5 billion of sales. We estimate that approximately 20% to 30% of these patients either do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, the market‑leading triptan drug class, and an additional 30% would benefit from improved efficacy compared to these drugs.
 Competition
 Triptans, a generic family of 5HT1B agonists, are the current standard treatment for acute treatment of migraine in the United States, and account for 70% of sales for this indication. Other less commonly prescribed acute treatments include ergot alkaloids, and analgesics such as opioids and NSAIDs. Various branded reformulations of triptan molecules have been launched, and we are aware of others in development. In May 2016, Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. launched a dry powder nasal delivery formulation of sumatriptan, called ONZETRA™ Xsail™. RedHill Biopharma, Ltd. and IntelGenx Corp. resubmitted the 505(b)(2) NDA for RIZAPORT®, an oral thin film rizatriptan formulation, to the FDA in November 2018. Eli Lilly acquired Lasmiditan, a selective 5HT1F agonist, from Colucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and filed an NDA for drug in November 2018. Allergan (atogepant and ubrogepant) and Biohaven (rimegepant) both have small molecule oral anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, antagonists in Phase 3 testing for the acute treatment of migraine.
 Patients suffering from frequent or chronic migraine headaches may also use preventative agents to decrease the frequency and severity of migraines. Botox® is the historical gold standard migraine prophylactic, but certain anticonvulsants, such as topiramate, and beta-blockers, such as propranolol, have also been used. However, a new class of anti-CGRP antibody products are being marketed for preventative treatment of migraine: In 2018, Amgen and Novartis launched Aimovig (erenumab), Eli Lilly and Company launched Emgality (galcanezumab), and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited launched Ajovy (fremanezumab); Alder BioPharmaceuticals Inc. is completing Phase 3 trials with its anti-CGRP antibody eptinezumab. Allergan also has migraine prevention trials underway for atogepant, an oral small molecule GGRP antagonist.
 Intellectual property
 Our TRV250 patent portfolio is wholly owned by us and includes one non-provisional patent application in the United States directed to compounds that modulate the delta receptor, which has been allowed, claiming, among other things, TRV250, compositions comprising TRV250, and methods of using TRV250. A patent that issues from this application is expected to expire no earlier than 2036, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. We also have patent applications pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand. Any patents that may issue from these applications are expected to expire no earlier than 2036, subject to any disclaimers or extensions.

 TRV734
 TRV734 is a small molecule G protein biased ligand of the MOR that we discovered and have developed through Phase 1 as a first‑line, orally administered compound for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute and chronic pain. Like oliceridine, TRV734 takes advantage of a well‑established mechanism of pain relief by targeting the MOR, but does so with enhanced selectivity for the G protein signaling pathway, which in preclinical studies was linked to analgesia, as opposed to the beta‑arrestin signaling pathway, which in preclinical studies was associated with side effects. Subject to successful preclinical and clinical development and regulatory approval, we believe TRV734 may have an improved efficacy and side effect profile as compared to current commonly prescribed oral analgesics, such as oxycodone. In addition, TRV734 may offer valuable benefits for another unmet medical need: the management of opioid dependence associated with opioid use disorder. In 2018, we announced that we are collaborating with NIDA to further evaluate TRV734 for this potential indication. We intend to continue to focus our efforts for TRV734 on securing a worldwide development and commercialization partner for this asset.
 Preclinical studies
 TRV734 has shown a similar profile to oliceridine in in vitro and in vivo studies. It is highly selective for the MOR where, like the most powerful opioid analgesics, it is a strong agonist of G protein coupling. TRV734 is distinct from those analgesics in its very weak recruitment of beta‑arrestins to the MOR. In our preclinical studies, TRV734 showed analgesic effects in preclinical pain models similar to oxycodone and morphine. In the same studies, TRV734 caused less constipation compared to equivalently analgesic doses of oxycodone and morphine. TRV734 is active after oral administration in mice and rats, has high oral bioavailability and has been well tolerated in non‑human primates. We have completed three Phase 1 trials of TRV734 in healthy volunteers, including a single ascending dose study, a multiple ascending dose study, and a pharmacokinetic study. In these studies, a total of 127 healthy volunteers were exposed to TRV734 at doses between 2 mg and 250 mg. We incorporated measures to assess the potential for analgesic efficacy and tolerability advantages in these studies. Based on these data and data for oliceridine, we believe that TRV734 may offer an improved efficacy profile as compared to current opioid therapies or equivalent efficacy with an improved gastrointestinal tolerability and respiratory safety profile.
 Intellectual property
 Our TRV734 patent portfolio is wholly owned by us and includes one issued U.S. patent (U.S. Patent No, 9,044,469) claiming TRV734, other compounds and/or methods of making or using the same. This patent is expected to expire no earlier than 2032, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. We also have issued patents in Australia, China, Europe, Eurasia, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, and New Zealand claiming TRV734, other compounds and/or methods of making or using the same. We also have patent applications pending in the United States, Europe, South Korea, Brazil, Canada, Israel, India, and Hong Kong. The issued patents and patents that could issue in the future from these allowed or pending applications outside the United States are expected to expire no earlier than 2032, subject to any disclaimers or extensions.
 S1P Modulators (TRV045)
 In July 2017, we disclosed a new preclinical lead optimization program targeting S1P receptors. Our compounds are all new chemical entities, are expected to be non-addictive, and use a new mechanism of action that in preclinical models avoids the immune suppression associated with approved and investigational S1P receptor targeted drugs. These molecules have demonstrated activity in preclinical models of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain, and inflammatory pain. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we identified a new product candidate, TRV045, a novel S1P modulator that we believe may offer a new, non-opioid approach to managing chronic pain. We anticipate beginning IND-enabling work in 2019, and we will continue to evaluate the progression of this asset to an IND, either by ourselves or with a partner.
 Our S1P patent portfolio is wholly owned by us and includes one PCT application directed to compounds that that modulate the S1P receptor. National phase applications based on this PCT application, if filed, would be filed in December 2019 and January 2020. Patents that could issue in the future from the national phase applications would be 

 
  13

 
expected to expire no earlier than 2038, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. We are aware of a certain U.S. patent owned by a third party with claims that are broadly directed to a method of treating chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain with an S1P receptor agonist or an S1P receptor antagonist. Although we do not believe that this is a valid patent, this patent could be construed to cover our S1P compounds.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of modulating GCPRs with biased ligands.
 One or more third parties may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that is important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. If we were not able to obtain a license, or were not able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment for our product candidates. We anticipate seeking patent protection in the United States and internationally for compositions of matter covering the compounds, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds and the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and the patent’s scope can be modified after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 Because many patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain patent protection for the inventions disclosed and/or claimed in our pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention or in post grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, inter partes review, post grant review or a derivation proceeding, that challenge our entitlement to an invention or the patentability of one or more claims in our patent applications or issued patents. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a PCT application or a non-provisional patent application, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. The term of a patent in the United States can be adjusted and extended due to the failure of the United States Patent and Trademark Office following certain statutory and regulation deadlines for issuing a patent.

 
  14

 

 In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA approved drug also may be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for a portion of the patent term lost during clinical development and the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under clinical development and regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. Although, we intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Commercialization
 We have not yet fully established sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure. Subject to successfully completing product development and receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities for our wholly owned products by insourcing or outsourcing a sales organization, initially in the hospital market, or by seeking a commercial partner in the United States. If we choose to insource or outsource a sales organization, we believe that it will be able to address the community of physicians who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. Outside the United States, we expect to enter into distribution and other commercial arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval. We also intend to license out commercial rights for products that require a substantial primary care presence. In parallel with building our commercial organization, we plan to develop educational initiatives with respect to approved products and relationships with thought leaders in relevant fields of medicine. Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Products in development by other companies may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other 

 
  15

 
benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
 Some of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 FDA Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  16

 


· | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, covering each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission of an NDA to the FDA;
--+---------------------------------


· | completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to determine GCP compliance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of an NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------


· | in certain cases, DEA review and scheduling activities prior to launch.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, toxicity and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Manufacture of drug substance, drug product and the labeling and distribution of clinical supplies must all comply with cGMP standards. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the data submitted in the IND or the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB covering each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted 

 
  17

 
diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well‑controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk‑benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of a marketing application.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA also may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. We expect that the mu‑opioid agonist products may be subject to a REMS, since currently marketed opioid products are subject to this requirement.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 The FDA typically refers a question regarding a novel drug to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre‑Approval Inspection, or PAI. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to 

 
  18

 
assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
 The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. The FDA reviews NDA resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included An approval letter authorizes commercial distribution and marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. For some products, an additional step of DEA review and scheduling is required.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post‑approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Expedited Review and Approval
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life‑threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life‑threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months.
 Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval, which is described in Subpart H of 21 Code of Federal Regulations, or 21 CFR Part 314, provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a clinical measurement or other biomarker used as an indirect or substitute measurement to predict a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post‑marketing clinical trials.
 A Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and FDA review of drugs for serious or life‑threatening conditions or where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate 

 
  19

 
substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. A request for Breakthrough Therapy designation should be submitted concurrently with, or as an amendment to an IND.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post‑approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post‑marketing testing, including clinical trials in pediatric patients or other Phase 4 trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post‑marketing studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies generally are required to promote their drug products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s approved labeling The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability.

 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 DEA Regulation
 Both oliceridine and TRV734, if approved, will be regulated as a “controlled substance” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
 The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Oliceridine and TRV734, if approved, are expected to be listed by the DEA as Schedule II controlled substances under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use will be subject to a high degree of regulation.
 Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports, exports, or conducts research with any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
 The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
 In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches.
 To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation with respect to the distribution of these products.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti‑kickback and false claims laws and regulations, as well as transparency and data privacy and security laws and regulations.

 
  21

 

 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and others on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
 The reach of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively PPACA, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. PPACA also created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs of payments and other transfers of value to, as well as ownership interests held by, physicians and teaching hospitals.
 The federal criminal and civil false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non‑reimbursable, uses.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposed specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on "covered entities," including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain 

 
  22

 
circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal or state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws, implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals, and data privacy requirements such as the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such treatments. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
 Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products. For example, in the United States, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost‑effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. In addition, for hospital products, a private health insurer or Medicare will typically reimburse a fixed fee for certain procedures, including in-patient surgeries. Pharmaceutical products such as oliceridine, if approved, that may be used in connection with the surgery generally will not be separately reimbursed and, therefore, a hospital would have to assess the cost of oliceridine, if approved, relative to its benefits. Current or future efforts to limit the level of reimbursement for in-patient hospital procedures could cause a hospital to decide not to use oliceridine, if approved by the FDA. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our 

 
  23

 
products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenue from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part.
 Impact of Healthcare Reform on Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non‑governmental payors.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 PPACA became law in March 2010 and substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the PPACA established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increased the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In the years since its enactment, there have been, and continue to be, significant developments in, and continued judicial, executive branch, and legislative activity around, attempts to repeal or repeal and replace the PPACA. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate,” the tax-based shared responsibility payment on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the current Presidential administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to 

 
  24

 
repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our product candidates, once approved, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our product candidates once they are approved.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, was signed into law. Among other things, this law created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 became law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some of these and other proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. We cannot anticipate what impact these or other future healthcare reform initiatives will have on coverage and reimbursement of our products or our business more generally.
 Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
 Hatch‑Waxman Patent Exclusivity
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro and/or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage, dosage form, or indication.

 
  25

 

 The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

· | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


· | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a patent of a listed drug. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 Hatch‑Waxman Non‑Patent Exclusivity
 Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five‑year period of non‑patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three‑year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three‑year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five‑year and three‑year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric Exclusivity
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non‑patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non‑patent exclusivity periods described above. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do 

 
  26

 
not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. When any of our products is approved, we anticipate seeking pediatric exclusivity when it is appropriate.
 Foreign Regulation
 To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the European Union, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Employees
