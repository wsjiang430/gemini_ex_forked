Item 1. Business
Background and Overview
 
Lucid Diagnostics Inc. (“Lucid”) is a commercial-stage medical diagnostics technology company focused on the millions of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (“GERD”), also known as chronic heartburn, acid reflux or simply reflux, who are at risk of developing esophageal precancer and cancer, specifically highly lethal esophageal adenocarcinoma (“EAC”). References in this Form 10-K to “we,” “us” and “our” are to Lucid and, unless the context otherwise requires, its subsidiaries.
 
We believe that our flagship product, the EsoGuard Esophageal DNA Test, performed on samples collected with the EsoCheck Esophageal Cell Collection Device, constitutes the first and only commercially available diagnostic test capable of serving as a widespread screening tool to prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma (“EAC”) deaths, through early detection of esophageal precancer in at-risk gastroesophageal reflux disease (“GERD,” also commonly known as chronic heartburn, acid reflux or simply reflux) patients.
 
EsoGuard is a bisulfite-converted next-generation sequencing (NGS) DNA assay performed on surface esophageal cells collected with EsoCheck. It quantifies methylation at 31 sites on two genes, Vimentin (VIM) and Cyclin A1 (CCNA1). The assay was evaluated in a 408-patient multicenter case-control study published in Science Translational Medicine and showed greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity at detecting esophageal precancer and all conditions along the BE-EAC spectrum, including on samples collected with EsoCheck (Moinova, et al. Sci Transl Med. 2018 Jan 17;10(424): eaao5848). EsoGuard is commercially available in the U.S. as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) performed at our CLIA-certified laboratory. Cell samples, including those collected with EsoCheck, as discussed below, are sent to our laboratory, for testing and analyses using our proprietary EsoGuard NGS DNA assay.
 
EsoCheck is an FDA 510(k) and CE Mark cleared noninvasive swallowable balloon capsule catheter device capable of sampling surface esophageal cells in a less than five-minute office procedure. It consists of a vitamin pill-sized rigid plastic capsule tethered to a thin silicone catheter from which a soft silicone balloon with textured ridges emerges to gently swab surface esophageal cells. When vacuum suction is applied, the balloon and sampled cells are pulled into the capsule, protecting them from contamination and dilution by cells outside of the targeted region during device withdrawal. We believe this proprietary Collect+Protect™ technology makes EsoCheck the only noninvasive esophageal cell collection device capable of such anatomically targeted and protected sampling.
 
EsoGuard and EsoCheck are based on patented technology licensed by Lucid from Case Western Reserve University (“CWRU”). EsoGuard and EsoCheck have been developed to provide an accurate, non-invasive, patient-friendly screening test for the early detection of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (“EAC”) and Barrett’s Esophagus (“BE”), including dysplastic BE and related pre-cursors to EAC in patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux (“GERD”).
 
Market Opportunity
 
In 2023, approximately 20,000 U.S. GERD patients are projected to be diagnosed with EAC and approximately 16,000 will die from it. Over 80% of EAC patients will die within five years of diagnosis, making it the second most lethal cancer in the U.S. The U.S. incidence of EAC has increased 500% over the past four decades, while the incidences of other common cancers have declined or remained flat. In nearly all cases, EAC silently progresses until it manifests itself with new symptoms of advanced disease. EAC is nearly always invasive at diagnosis, and, unlike other common cancers, mortality rates are high even in its earlier stages.
 
As discussed below under the heading “Clinical Guidelines for At-Risk Population”, the American Gastroenterology Association (“AGA”) recently significantly expanded the target population for esophageal precancer screening, recommending screening in at-risk patients without symptoms of GERD. Based on this revision, we believe the cohort recommended for screening consists of an estimated 30 million U.S. individuals with at least 3 established risk factors for BE. Accordingly, we believe EsoGuard’s total addressable U.S. market opportunity exceeds $60 billion based on an effective Medicare payment of $1,938 and the estimated 30 million U.S. patients recommended for screening by clinical practice guidelines. (In December 2019, we secured “gapfill” determination for EsoGuard’s PLA code 0114U through the CMS CLFS process. This allowed us to engage directly with Medicare contractor Palmetto GBA and its MolDx Program on CMS payment and coverage. In October 2020, CMS granted EsoGuard final Medicare payment determination of $1,938.01, effective January 1, 2021.)
 
Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, less than 10% of at-risk patients who are recommended for screening undergo traditional invasive upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD). We believe that the profound tragedy of an EAC diagnosis is that likely death could have been prevented if the at-risk patient had been screened and then undergone surveillance and curative endoscopic esophageal ablation of dysplastic BE.
 
Since mortality rates are high even in early stage EAC, preventing EAC deaths requires detection and intervention at the precancer stage. Most of the necessary elements for such an early detection program are already well established—an at-risk population (at-risk GERD patients), a precancer (BE), and an intervention which can halt progression to EAC (endoscopic esophageal ablation). The only missing element for such an early detection program is a widespread screening tool that can detect BE prior to EAC.
 
We believe EsoGuard, used with EsoCheck, constitutes that missing element—the first and only commercially available diagnostic test capable of serving as a widespread screening tool to prevent EAC deaths through early detection of esophageal precancer and cancer in patients with 3 or more risk factors.

Clinical Guidelines for At-Risk Population
 
The subgroup of long-standing or severe GERD patients at-risk for BE and progression to EAC is well defined in clinical practice guidelines, including the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) BE Guidelines. In its Recommendation 5, the ACG suggests a single screening endoscopy in patients with chronic GERD symptoms and 3 or more additional risk factors for BE, including male sex, age greater than 50 years, White race, tobacco smoking, obesity, and family history of BE or EAC in a first-degree relative.
 
An ACG clinical guideline entitled “Diagnosis and Management of Barrett’s Esophagus: An Updated ACG Guideline,” the first such update since 2016, was published online last year in the American Journal of Gastroenterology. The clinical guideline reiterates the ACG’s long-standing recommendation for esophageal precancer screening in at-risk patients with GERD. For the first time, however, the clinical guideline also endorses nonendoscopic biomarker screening as an acceptable alternative to costly and invasive endoscopy stating that “a swallowable nonendoscopic capsule device combined with a biomarker is an acceptable alternative to endoscopy for BE.” The clinical guideline specifically mentions EsoCheck, along with our EsophaCap® device, as such swallowable, nonendoscopic esophageal cell collection devices, as well as methylated DNA biomarkers such as EsoGuard. The summary of evidence for this recommendation includes a reference to the seminal NIH-funded, multicenter, case-control study published in 2018 in Science Translational Medicine, which demonstrated that EsoGuard is highly accurate at detecting esophageal precancer and cancer, including on samples collected with EsoCheck.
 
In July 2022, the American Gastroenterology Association (“AGA”) published in their “Clinical Practice Update on New Technology and Innovation for Surveillance and Screening in Barrett’s Esophagus” updated clinical guidance that mirrors the same furnished by the ACG as described above, endorsing the use of non-endoscopic cell collection tools to screen for BE like our EsoCheck Cell Collection Device, which is cited in the update, as an acceptable alternative to endoscopy to directly address the need for noninvasive screening tools that are easy to administer, patient friendly, and cost-effective for the detection of BE. The clinical practice update by the AGA also significantly expands the target population for esophageal precancer screening, including for EsoGuard and EsoCheck, by recommending, for the first time, screening in at-risk patients without symptoms of GERD. The AGA does so by adding a history of chronic GERD as merely an additional, seventh risk factor to the six risk factors for BE and EAC that have traditionally identified at-risk symptomatic patients recommended for screening.
 
Commercialization
 
Our EsoGuard commercialization efforts span multiple channels including targeting primary care physicians and GI physicians, who have generally embraced our message that EsoGuard has the potential to expand the funnel of BE-EAC patients who will need long term EGD surveillance and, potentially, treatment with endoscopic esophageal ablation.
 
To assure sufficient testing capacity and geographic coverage, we have built our own network of Lucid Test Centers, staffed by Lucid-employed clinical personnel, where patients can undergo the EsoCheck procedure and have the sample sent for EsoGuard testing at our CLIA-certified laboratory. Our current test center network currently includes locations in metropolitan areas in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas and Utah.
 
In addition to our base test center network, we have established a satellite test center program, whereby we are expanding our footprint by making our personnel available to perform cell collection services in physician offices. Further, we have sought to expand our outreach by successfully conducting multiple “#CheckYourFoodTube Precancer Testing Event” for organizations such as the San Antonio Fire Department, where samples are collected from the organization’s employees for testing with EsoGuard at our CLIA-certified laboratory.
 
We have also established an EsoGuard Telemedicine Program, in partnership with UpScript, LLC, an independent third-party telemedicine provider, that accommodates EsoGuard self-referrals from direct-to-consumer marketing.
 
Reimbursement and Market Access
 
As noted above, in December 2019, we secured “gapfill” determination for EsoGuard’s PLA code 0114U through the CMS CLFS process. This allowed us to engage directly with Medicare contractor Palmetto GBA and its MolDx Program on CMS payment and coverage. In October 2020, CMS granted EsoGuard final Medicare payment determination of $1,938.01, effective January 1, 2021.
A proposed Local Coverage Determination (“LCD”) DL39256, entitled “Molecular Testing for Detection of Upper Gastrointestinal Metaplasia, Dysplasia, and Neoplasia” was published recently on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) website by MAC Palmetto GBA. The proposed LCD is a further step in our efforts to secure Medicare coverage and payment for EsoGuard. The proposed LCD, which the CMS website explicitly characterizes as a “work in progress” for “public review,” outlines criteria that MolDX expects upper gastrointestinal precancer and cancer molecular diagnostic tests to meet. These criteria include active GERD with at least two risk factors, as well as evidence of analytic validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility. Although the proposed LCD indicated that it found that no currently existing test has fulfilled all these criteria, it indicated that it will “monitor the evidence and will provide coverage based on the pertinent literature and society recommendations.” Notably, the proposed LCD pre-dated, and therefore does not include consideration of, the most recent AGA clinical practice update endorsing swallowable, nonendoscopic capsule devices combined with a biomarker, such as EsoCheck and EsoGuard,, an an alternative to endoscopy. The publication of the proposed LCD triggered a written comment period, and MolDX also held an open meeting on May 10, 2022, during which stakeholders and other interested parties had the opportunity to address the proposed LCD. We presented at the public meeting and made a written submission during the comment period as well. A final LCD will not be issued until the MAC has had the opportunity to assess and consider all stakeholder comments.
 
While we await a CMS coverage determination from MolDX, we are aggressively pursuing EsoGuard commercial insurer payment and coverage. Although the claim adjudication cycle can be prolonged during the early commercialization of a new test, we have received out-of-network commercial insurance payments for the EsoGuard test, and has entered into agreements with insurers that provide access to, in the aggregate, over 70 million patients.

Clinical Utility and Clinical Trials
 
Demonstrating EsoGuard’s clinical utility, which requires providing evidence that the test has a meaningful impact on clinical practice, is very important for a variety of purposes, including, importantly, for Medicare and private payor payment and coverage. It has been established that one of the most important factors to private payors in deciding whether to grant payment and coverage will be demonstration that the EsoGuard test, when ordered by physicians, provides information that can be used to identify or exclude patients who would benefit from additional management and/or treatment. Clinical utility studies are also important for general EsoGuard commercialization by facilitating physician understanding of test indications and potential benefit to the patients.
 
We are currently seeking to accelerate our collection of clinical utility data through a range of trials that can be efficiently executed. These efforts include a planned investigator-initiated, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on the approximately 400 San Antonio fire fighters who underwent testing as part of a community-sponsored cancer awareness event (in respect of which we expect to publish results in the first half of 2023); an ongoing investigator-initiated, retrospective, single-center, study with 500 patients (in respect of which we expect to publish results mid-2023), a virtual-patient randomized controlled trial with intended recruitment of 100-200 physician participants (in respect of which we expect to publish results this year); a Lucid-sponsored multi-center, prospective, observational study with 500 patients; and a Lucid-sponsored registry at existing Lucid Test Centers, whereby all patients undergoing EsoCheck testing will be given the opportunity to provide informed consent and contribute data about their risk factors, EsoGuard results, and subsequent diagnostic and/or therapeutic journey. Both Lucid-sponsored observational/registry studies expect to have preliminary results and/or interim analysis before the end of 2023.
 
As previously disclosed, consequently, we have decided to delay for the time being the two previously commenced clinical trials, the “EsoGuard screening study” (“BE-1”) and the “EsoGuard case-control study” (“BE-2”), as we are devoting our clinical resources to the studies cited above, which we expect will more efficiently generate the clinical data we are currently prioritizing to drive EsoGuard commercialization.
 
Manufacturing
 
EsoCheck is currently manufactured for us by our partners Coastline International, a high-volume device manufacturer, and Sage Product Development. Through mid-2023, we expect to further transition from Sage to Coastline as the manufacturing process is further optimized. Our current line capacity can produce up to 25,000 units per year. With Coastline’s improvement and expansion, there is capacity to scale exponentially. Our EsoGuard Specimen Kits are currently manufactured for us by our partner Path-Tec. The warehousing, logistics, fulfillment and customer support of our products is managed for us by our partners HealthLink International (a leading third-party logistics company) and Path-Tec.
License Agreement
 
Under the terms of our license agreement with CWRU, we acquired an exclusive worldwide right to use the intellectual property rights to the EsoGuard and EsoCheck technology for the detection of changes in the esophagus and on sample preservation. we are required to pay CWRU royalties on net sales of licensed products as follows: 5% of net sales of less than $100 million per year; and 8% of net sales greater than $100 million per year. We are also required to pay CWRU minimum annual royalty payments as follows: $50,000 per year, beginning January 1 following the first anniversary of a commercial sale of a licensed product; $150,000 per year, if net sales of a licensed product exceed $25 million in a year; $300,000 per year, if net sales of a licensed product exceed $50 million in a year; and $600,000 per year, if net sales of a licensed product exceed $100 million in a year. Minimum yearly royalty amounts are subject to increase based on the percentage change in the CPI-W Consumer Price Index and are credited against the royalties otherwise due. The license agreement was subject to four regulatory and commercialization milestones, of which one remains unachieved and unpaid. The remaining milestone is the FDA PMA submission of a licensed product, upon the achievement of which we will pay CWRU a milestone payment of $200,000. The license agreement terminates upon the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent, or on May 12, 2038, in countries where no such patents exist, or upon expiration of any exclusive marketing rights for a licensed product that have been granted by FDA or other U.S. government agency, whichever comes later. The EsoCheck patents, which are currently the last to expire, begin to expire in May 2035.
Regulatory
 
In June 2019, we received FDA 510(k) clearance to market EsoCheck in the U.S. as a device indicated for use in the collection and retrieval of surface cells of the esophagus in adults followed by FDA 510(k) clearance in 2022, expanding the use of EsoCheck in adults and pediatric populations in the U.S. In December 2019, our CLIA-certified then-laboratory partner, completed documentation of EsoGuard analytical validity allowing us to commercialize it as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT).
 
In February 2020, we received FDA “Breakthrough Device Designation” for EsoGuard as an in-vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) medical device. The FDA Breakthrough Device Program was created to offer patients more timely access to breakthrough technologies which provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or conditions by expediting their development, assessment and review through enhanced communications and more efficient and flexible clinical study design, including more favorable pre/post market data collection balance. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the United States Congress continue to work to provide an expedited coverage pathway for emerging technologies.

In May 2021, we received CE Mark certification for EsoCheck (under the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC), and in June 2021, we completed CE Mark self-certification for EsoGuard (under the European In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices Directive (IVDD 98/79/EC)), indicating both may be marketed in CE Mark European countries.
 
Our longer-term strategy is to secure a specific indication, based on published guidelines, for BE screening in certain at-risk populations using EsoGuard on samples collected with EsoCheck. This use of EsoGuard together with EsoCheck as a screening system must be cleared or approved by the FDA as an IVD device.
 
Laboratory Operations
 
On February 25, 2022, our new, wholly owned subsidiary, LucidDx Labs Inc. (“LucidDx Labs”), acquired from RDx, certain licenses and other related assets necessary for LucidDx Labs to operate its own new CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited clinical laboratory located in Lake Forest, CA. Since March 2022, we have conducted EsoGuard testing at our own laboratory with, until recently, the assistance of RDx, which had continued to provide certain testing and related services for the laboratory in accordance with the terms of a management services agreement (“MSA-RDx”), dated and effective February 25, 2022. Recently, however, the Company accelerated the development of internal resources necessary to operate the laboratory entirely on its own. Accordingly, our subsidiary LucidDx Labs and RDx agreed terminate the MSA-RDx effective as of February 10, 2023, such that LucidDx Labs now operates the laboratory itself, which the Company believes will improve the efficiency of the performance of the EsoGuard assay.
Competition
 
The U.S. market for esophageal cancer (i.e., EAC) and pre-cancer (i.e., BE, with or without dysplasia) screening is large, consisting of more than 30 million at-risk individuals over the age of 50. Given the large market for pre-cancer screening, we likely will face numerous competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than us. Our EsoGuard test faces competition from procedure-based detection technologies such as upper endoscopy, and other screening technologies such as multi-cancer early detection products. Our EsoCheck device faces competition from other manufactures with devices designed to collect cell samples from targeted regions of the esophagus. For example, Cytosponge is a small mesh sponge within a soluble gelatin capsule that dissolves in the stomach and then is pulled thru the targeted region brushing the lining of the esophagus and then later retrieved, although, unlike EsoCheck, it is unprotected from contamination. Our competitors may also be developing additional methods of detecting esophageal cancer and pre-cancer that have not yet been announced.
 
Accordingly, the market for our products is highly competitive and is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. In order to compete effectively, EsoGuard and EsoCheck will have to achieve market acceptance, receive adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement, be cost effective and be simultaneously safe and effective. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are:
 

● | diagnostic accuracy and the quality of outcomes for medical conditions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | acceptance by physicians and the medical device market generally; 
● | ease of use and reliability; 
● | technical leadership and superiority; 
● | effective marketing and distribution; 
● | speed to market; and 
● | product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement. 

 
Most of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources. We may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors either because their products and services are superior or more cost efficient, or because of they have access to greater resources than us. These competitors may have greater name recognition than we do. Many of these competitors have obtained all desirable FDA or other regulatory approvals, and superior patent protection, for their products. Certain of our competitors have already commercialized their products, and others may commercialize their products in advance of our products. In addition, our competitors may make technical advances that render our products obsolete. We may be unable to respond to such technical advances.
 
We will also compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business. We are aware of several companies that compete or are developing technologies in our current and future products areas. In order to compete effectively, our products will have to achieve market acceptance, receive adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement, be cost effective and be simultaneously safe and effective.


Esocure
 
In connection with our efforts to expand our presence in the EAC diagnostic market, we are also developing the EsoCure Esophageal Ablation Device, with the intent to allow a clinician to treat dysplastic BE before it can progress to EAC, a highly lethal esophageal cancer, and to do so without the need for complex and expensive capital equipment. We have successfully completed a pre-clinical feasibility animal study of EsoCure demonstrating excellent, controlled circumferential ablation of the esophageal mucosal lining. An acute and survival animal study of EsoCure Esophageal Ablation Device has also been completed, demonstrating successful direct thermal balloon catheter ablation of esophageal lining through the working channel of a standard endoscope. When resources permit, we plan to conduct additional development work and animal testing of EsoCure to support a future FDA 510(k) submission.
 
In March 2022, both the PAVmed and Lucid board of directors approved entering into an intercompany license between PAVmed and Lucid such that Lucid will be granted the rights to commercialize EsoCure for the treating dysplastic Barrett’s Esophagus. Under the intercompany license, Lucid will pay PAVmed a 5% royalty on all EsoCure sales up to $100 million per calendar year, and 8% above that threshold.

Our Relationship with PAVmed Inc.
 
We are a majority-owned subsidiary of PAVmed, and PAVmed has a controlling financial interest. We continue to depend on PAVmed to provide us various management, technical, research and development, legal, accounting, and administrative services.
 
PAVmed owns approximately 73% as of December 31, 2022 and 72% as of March 9, 2023 of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock (with such percentage inclusive of shares of our common stock underlying granted but unvested restricted stock awards). For as long as PAVmed continues to control more than 50% of our common stock, PAVmed will be able to direct the election of all the members of our board of directors. Similarly, PAVmed will have the power to determine matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders without the consent of our other stockholders, to prevent a change in control of us, and to take other actions that might be favorable to PAVmed, without prior notice to other stockholders. PAVmed’s controlling interest may discourage a change of control that other holders of our common stock may favor.
 
We are party to a management services agreement with PAVmed (the “MSA”), as well as a payroll benefits and expense reimbursement agreement (the “PBERA”). Under the MSA, PAVmed provides management, technical and administrative services to us, including without limitation services related to research and development, regulatory clearance, manufacture, and commercialization of our products, as well as services related to corporate financial, accounting and legal matters. The terms of this agreement are intended to be consistent with the terms that we could have negotiated with unaffiliated third parties; however, they may actually be more or less favorable. Under the PBERA, as more fully described below, PAVmed has agreed to pay certain payroll and benefit-related expenses in respect of our personnel on our behalf, and we reimburse PAVmed for the same. PAVmed may elect that our obligations under each of the MSA and the PBERA are settled by the issuance of our stock (instead of cash), subject to applicable restrictions under securities laws (and, in the case of the PBERA, subject also to approval by our board). The MSA does not have a termination date, but may be terminated by the our board of directors at any time. The PBERA likewise does not have a termination date, but may be terminated by PAVmed or Lucid at any time.

Status of Clinical Trials
 
We are currently seeking to accelerate our collection of clinical utility data through a range of trials that can be efficiently executed. These efforts include a planned investigator-initiated, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on the approximately 400 San Antonio fire fighters who underwent testing as part of a community-sponsored cancer awareness event (in respect of which we expect to publish results in the first half of 2023); an ongoing investigator-initiated, retrospective, single-center, study with 500 patients (in respect of which we expect to publish results mid-2023), a virtual-patient randomized controlled trial with intended recruitment of 100-200 physician participants (in respect of which we expect to publish results this year); a Lucid-sponsored multi-center, prospective, observational study with 500 patients; and a Lucid-sponsored registry at existing Lucid Test Centers, whereby all patients undergoing EsoCheck testing will be given the opportunity to provide informed consent and contribute data about their risk factors, EsoGuard results, and subsequent diagnostic and/or therapeutic journey. Both Lucid-sponsored observational/registry studies expect to have preliminary results and/or interim analysis before the end of 2023.
 
As previously disclosed, consequently, we have decided to delay for the time being the two previously commenced clinical trials, the “EsoGuard screening study” (“BE-1”) and the “EsoGuard case-control study” (“BE-2”), as we are devoting our clinical resources to the studies cited above, which we expect will more efficiently generate the clinical data we are currently prioritzing to drive EsoGuard commercialization.
 
LucidDx Labs Laboratory Operations Update
 
On February 14, 2023, we and our subsidiary, LucidDx Labs Inc., entered into an agreement (the “MSA Termination Agreement”) with RDx, pursuant to which the parties mutually agreed to terminate the MSA-RDx without cause. The termination was effective as February 10, 2023. Until the termination of the MSA-RDx, RDx had continued to provide certain testing and related services for the Laboratory in accordance with the terms of the MSA-RDx. Recently, however, we accelerated the development of internal resources necessary to operate the Laboratory entirely on its own. Accordingly, we believe that termination of the MSA-RDx will improve the efficiency of the performance of the EsoGuard assay.
 
Among other things, the MSA Termination Agreement reduces the remaining amounts of the earnout payments and management fees due under the APA-RDx and the MSA-RDx to $725,000 (from the $3,450,000 that would otherwise have been payable under the APA and MSA if the MSA had remained in effect through the balance of its stated term), resulting in a net savings to us of $2,725,000. The payment was satisfied through the issuance of 553,436 shares of Lucid Diagnostics’ common stock on February 25, 2023. We were not required to make any cash payments in connection with the termination.
 
#CheckYourFoodTube Precancer Testing Events
 
In January 2023, we successfully completed our first #CheckYourFoodTube Precancer Testing Event, in partnership with Rachelle Hamblin, M.D., M.P.H., and the San Antonio Fire Department (SAFD), to detect esophageal precancer in at-risk members of the department. The SAFD testing event was held over two weekends in January, which has been designated as Firefighter Cancer Awareness Month by the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). A total of 391 members, nearly one-quarter of the department, who were deemed by Dr. Hamblin to be at-risk for esophageal precancer, underwent a brief, on-site, noninvasive cell collection procedure, performed by our clinical personnel using EsoCheck. Firefighters with suspected esophageal precancer based on a positive EsoGuard result were identified, including some less than forty years of age, and will undergo appropriate monitoring and treatment, as indicated by clinical practice guidelines, to prevent progression to esophageal cancer. These events, which we look to expand across the country, are an extension of our expanding satellite Lucid Test Center (sLTC) program, which brings our precancer testing directly to patients—at their physician’s office and now at large testing day events. We demonstrated that our nurse practitioners can each perform up to fifty EsoCheck procedures in a day, and our laboratory team handled over two hundred incoming samples in a day, while maintaining turnaround times at target. These successes provide an excellent foundation for future testing events as we continue to drive EsoGuard commercialization using all the tools at our disposal.
Payroll and Benefit Expense Reimbursement Agreement
 
On November 30, 2022, PAVmed and we entered into a payroll and benefit expense reimbursement agreement (the “PBERA”). Historically, PAVmed has paid for certain payroll and benefit-related expenses in respect of our personnel on our behalf, and we have reimbursed PAVmed for the same. Pursuant to the PBERA, PAVmed will continue to pay such expenses, and we will continue to reimburse PAVmed for the same. The PBERA now provides that the expenses will be reimbursed on a quarterly basis or at such other frequency as the parties may determine, in cash or, subject to approval by PAVmed’s and our boards of directors, in shares of our common stock, with such shares valued at the volume weighted average price of such stock during the final ten trading days preceding the later of the two dates on which such stock issuance is approved by PAVmed’s and our boards of directors (subject to a floor price of $0.40 per share), or in a combination of cash and shares. However, in no event shall we issue any shares of our common stock to PAVmed in satisfaction of all or any portion of the expenses if the issuance of such shares of our common stock would exceed the maximum number of shares of common stock that we may issue under the rules or regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), unless we obtain the approval of our stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the Nasdaq for issuances of shares of our common stock in excess of such amount.

Financing


Committed Equity Facility and ATM Facility
 
In March 2022, we entered into a committed equity facility with an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald (“Cantor”). Under the terms of the facility, Cantor committed to purchase up to $50 million of our common stock from time to time upon our request. While there are distinct differences, the facility is structured similarly to a traditional at-the-market equity facility, insofar as it allows us to raise primary capital on a periodic basis at prices based on the existing market price. Through December 31, 2022, 680,263 shares of our common stock were issued under this facility for total proceeds of approximately $1.8 million.
 
In November 2022, we also entered into an “at-the-market offering” for up to $6.5 million of our common stock that may be offered and sold under a Controlled Equity Offering Agreement between us and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. In the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no shares sold through the at-the-market equity facility. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, through March 9, 2023, we sold 230,068 shares through its at-the-market equity facility for approximately $0.3 million.
 
Series A Preferred Stock Offering
 
On March 7, 2023, we entered into subscription agreements for the sale of 13,625 shares of Series A preferred stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1,000 and a conversion price of $1.394. The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock also include a one times preference on liquidation and a right to receive dividends equal to 20% of the number of shares into which such Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, payable on the one-year and two-year anniversary of the issuance date. The Series A Preferred Stock is a non-voting security, other than with respect to limited matters related to changes in terms of the Series A Preferred Stock. The aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares in such offering were $13.625 million.
Senior Secured Convertible Note
 
Effective as of March 13, 2023, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with an accredited institutional investor (“Investor”, “Lender”, and /or “Holder”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell, and the Investor agreed to purchase a Senior Secured Convertible Note with a face value principal of $11.1 million (the “March 2023 Senior Convertible Note”). The issuance of the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note is subject to customary closing conditions.
 
The March 2023 Senior Secured Convertible Note would have a 7.875% annual stated interest rate, a contractual conversion price of $5.00 per share of the Company’s common stock (subject to standard adjustments in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction), and a contractual maturity date of the two-year anniversary of the date of issuance. The March 2023 Senior Convertible Note would be convertible into or otherwise paid in shares of the Company’s common stock.
 
Under the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note, the Company would be subject to certain customary affirmative and negative covenants regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, the existence of liens, the repayment of indebtedness and the making of investments, the payment of cash in respect of dividends, distributions or redemptions, the transfer of assets, the maturity of other indebtedness, and transactions with affiliates, among other customary matters. Under the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note, the Company would also be subject to financial covenants requiring that (i) the amount of our available cash equal or exceed $5.0 million at all times, (ii) the ratio of (a) the outstanding principal amount of the notes issued under the SPA, accrued and unpaid interest thereon and accrued and unpaid late charges to (b) the Company’s average market capitalization over the prior ten trading days, not exceed 30%, and (iii) that the Company’s market capitalization shall at no time be less than an amount to be agreed upon.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our business will depend on proprietary medical device and diagnostic technologies, including the EsoCheck and EsoGuard technology licensed by us. We intend to vigorously protect our proprietary technologies’ intellectual property rights in patents, trademarks and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally. Patent protection and other proprietary rights are thus essential to our Diagnostics business. We currently have applied for, license or own 19 domestic and foreign patents covering the EsoGuard and EsoCheck products and related technology. The date the patents protecting certain of our owned and licensed technology will first begin to expire is as set forth in the table below (although currently pending patent applications, both foreign and domestic, are positioned to provide protection beyond such date in each instance).

Technology | Year 
-----------+----------------
EsoCheck | May 2034 
EsoGuard | August 2024 
EsoCure | March 2036 



The EsoCheck and EsoGuard technology is protected by patents in the United States and internationally, and our policy is to continue to aggressively file patent applications, both independently and in collaboration with CWRU, as appropriate, to protect this technology and other of our proprietary technologies relating to our Diagnostics business, including inventions and improvements to inventions. Under the CWRU License Agreement, CWRU has agreed to apply for patent coverage, at our expense, in any country requested by us, to the extent such protection is reasonably attainable. We seek patent protection, as appropriate, on:
 

● | the product itself including all embodiments with future commercial potential; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the methods of using the product; and 
● | the methods of manufacturing the product. 

 
In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we intend to file counterpart patent applications in other countries worldwide where there is a value in doing so. Foreign filings can be cumbersome and expensive, and we will pursue such filings when we believe they are warranted as we try to balance our international commercialization plans with our desire to protect the global value of the technology.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent, or patent term extension, which restores time lost due to regulatory delays.
 
We intend to continuously reassess and fine-tune our intellectual property strategy in order to fortify the position of our business in the United States and internationally. Prior to acquiring or licensing a technology from a third party, we will evaluate the existing proprietary rights, our ability to adequately obtain and protect these rights and the likelihood or possibility of infringement upon competing rights of others.

We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and may rely upon licensing opportunities, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We intend to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and/or proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants, independent contractors and other entities who may have access to proprietary information. We will generally require employees to assign patents and other intellectual property to us as a condition of employment with us. All of our consulting agreements will pre-emptively assign to us all new and improved intellectual property that arise during the term of the agreement.
 
Lucid also has (directly or through its subsidiaries) proprietary rights to a range of trademarks, including, among others, Lucid Diagnostics™, LUCID™, EsoCheck®, EsoGuard®, Collect + Protect®, and EsoCheck Cell Collection Device®. (Solely as a matter of convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to herein may or may not be accompanied with the requisite marks of “™” or “®”. However, the absence of such marks is not intended to indicate, in any way, Lucid or its subsidiaries will not assert, to the fullest extent possible under applicable law, their respective rights to such trademarks and trade names.)
 
Health Insurance Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our products are used.
 
In the United States, third-party payors continue to implement initiatives that restrict the use of certain technologies to those that meet certain clinical evidentiary requirements. In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our products are used. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program’s updates to hospital and physician payments, which are done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions.
 
A product’s reimbursement profile, both in the U.S. and internationally, is an important component of the product’s commercial opportunity. We prefer projects with existing reimbursement codes, the opportunity to seek reimbursement under higher-value surgical procedure codes or the potential to seek reimbursement under narrow, product-specific codes as opposed to bundled procedure codes. For those products that have high strategic value, but with less defined reimbursement, we have engaged reimbursement experts and support from industry associations to accelerate the acquisition of satisfactory reimbursement levels.
 
See “Reimbursement and Market Access” above for a fuller discussion of the reimbursement status for EsoCheck and EsoGuard.
 
Government Regulation
 
Key U.S. Regulation
 
FDA Regulation
 
For the purposes of FDA regulation a “medical device” is broadly defined in section 201(h) of the FDCA as “an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in-vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, which is intended for use in humans for the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes.” Medical devices subject to FDA regulation include “in-vitro diagnostic medical devices” or IVD devices, defined in the same FDCA section as “reagents, instruments, and systems intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including a determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its sequelae, which are intended for use in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens taken from the human body”.
 
Our marketing of any medical device product we may develop, license, or acquire, including traditional medical devices such as EsoCheck, and IVD products such as EsoGuard, is subject to FDA regulation.
 

● | In June 2019, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for EsoCheck, permitting us to market it in the U.S. as a cell collection device indicated for use in the collection and retrieval of surface cells of the esophagus in the general population of adults, 22 years of age and older. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In December 2019, RDx, our then-CLIA-certified laboratory partner completed documentation of EsoGuard analytical validity allowing us to commercialize it as an LDT. In March 2022, we transferred EsoGuard testing to our own CLIA-certified laboratory, upon our acquisition of certain assets from RDx as described elsewhere in this report.

FDA defines an LDT as “an IVD product that is intended for clinical use and designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory.” FDA has long maintained that it has clear regulatory authority over LDTs and has chosen to fully exercise its authority for certain classes of “single laboratory” IVD products which would satisfy its definition of an LDT, such as direct-to-consumer tests that do not involve a health care provider. FDA, however, has generally not enforced these regulatory requirements for most LDTs not in one of these classes and has generally not required these LDTs to undergo FDA premarket review of analytical validity and clinical validity, as all other IVD products must. For over a decade, FDA has expressed its concern about insufficient regulatory oversight over increasingly high-risk LDTs. On multiple occasions from 2010 to 2020 it announced its intent to reconsider its long-standing policy of LDT enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs but never acted on this intent, limiting its actions to hosting a public workshop to gather feedback from industry stakeholders. publishing two draft guidance documents describing a proposed risk-based framework to LDTs, issuing a report citing evidence for the need for additional regulation of LDTs, and issuing a Discussion Paper on LDTs. FDA never issued a final guidance document on the regulation of LDTs and, in 2020, HHS announced that, effective immediately, it was rescinding all guidance, compliance manuals, website statements, or other informal issuances concerning FDA premarket review of LDTs, and that FDA may not require premarket review of LDTs absent a formal notice-and-comment rulemaking process.
 
This 2020 HHS directive notwithstanding, the regulatory status for LDTs such as EsoGuard remains somewhat ambiguous and uncertain. The current administration could rescind the HHS directive and allow FDA to return to its previous regime of enforcement discretion. The Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID) Act of 2020, which seeks to revamp the regulatory framework of diagnostic tests, including LDTs, is expected to be reintroduced in 2021 and could radically alter the landscape for LDTs. FDA may also choose to modify its enforcement discretion of elements of its “single laboratory” definition of LDTs which by strict interpretation would require the LDT to have been “designed” at the “single laboratory” and not transferred from another research laboratory, as EsoGuard was.
 
Since only EsoCheck is FDA cleared, we are not permitted to jointly market it with EsoGuard. This currently is not a significant obstacle to our commercialization efforts, which are almost entirely devoted to marketing EsoGuard. EsoCheck is merely offered, free of charge, as a generic esophageal cell collection device, which is FDA 510(k) cleared to be used to collect samples for any diagnostic test. We believe, however, over the long-term, once our commercialization efforts have gain significant traction, it would be useful to jointly market EsoGuard, used with EsoCheck, as a combined product. We therefore may, when resources permit, pursue FDA PMA approval for EsoGuard, when used on samples collected with EsoCheck, which will allow us to jointly market them as well as provide protection against changes to LDT regulation which could threaten our ability to market EsoGuard as an LDT.
 
FDA “Breakthrough Device” is highly-coveted special designation under FDA’s Breakthrough Devices Program, established pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act and the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, which seeks to offer patients and healthcare providers timely access to medical devices which “provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or conditions” by speeding up their development, assessment and review through (i) enhanced communications (ii) more efficient and flexible clinical study design, including more favorable pre/post market data collection balance and (iii) priority review of regulatory submissions. Once effective, MCIT would provide each Breakthrough Device with four years of national Medicare coverage starting on the date of FDA market authorization. In February 2020 we were granted Breakthrough Device designation for EsoGuard on esophageal samples collected using EsoCheck. Pursuant to this designation, we will be working with FDA to design an extension to our current screening study to support an expanded indication to detect dysplastic BE, once FDA resumes Breakthrough Device meetings for IVD products, which are currently on hold as the branch works to clear a Covid-19 pandemic related backlog.
 
Before and after approval or clearance in the United States, our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, recordkeeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and products.
 
In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy:
 

Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class II: special controls, pre-market notification (often referred to as a 510(k) application), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries, post-market surveillance, additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and 
Class III: special controls and approval of a de novo request or PMA application, likely with clinical data requirements. 

 
In general, the higher the classification, the greater the time and cost to obtain approval to market. There are no “standardized” requirements for approval, even within each class. For example, FDA could grant 510(k) status, but require a human clinical trial, a typical requirement of a PMA. They could also initially assign a device Class III status but end up clearing a device as a 510(k) device if certain requirements are met. The range of the number and expense of the various requirements is significant. The quickest and least expensive pathway would be 510(k) clearance with a review of existing bench and animal data. The longest and most expensive path would be a PMA with extensive randomized human clinical trials. We cannot predict fully how FDA will classify our products, nor predict what requirements will be placed upon us to obtain market clearance or approval, or even if they will clear or approve our products at all.
 
To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another currently legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a currently legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a currently legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information, and the results of performance testing. In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence only when FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or that would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, could require a de novo request or PMA. In addition, any additional claims the Company wished to make at a later date may require a PMA. If FDA determines that the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, they will issue a Not Substantially Equivalent letter, at which point the Company must submit and FDA must approve a de novo request or PMA before marketing can begin.

-


During the review of a 510(k) submission, FDA may request more information or additional studies and may decide that the indications for which we seek approval or clearance should be limited. In addition, laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by FDA may change in the future. We cannot foresee what effect, if any, such changes may have on us as a company.
 
Clinical Trials of Medical Devices and Diagnostic Tests
 
One or more clinical trials may be necessary to support an FDA submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or diagnostic tests being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE application to FDA prior to initiation of the clinical study. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device on humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE is reviewed by FDA within 30 calendar days after receipt by FDA and FDA can issue a disapproval, conditional approval or full approval for the study to begin depending on the remaining FDA questions following review. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an IRB has approved the study.
 
During any study, the sponsor must comply with FDA’s IDE requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. We, FDA, or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application.
 
Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices and Diagnostic Tests
 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | FDA Quality Systems Regulation (QSR), which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 
● | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to FDA of certain adverse experience associated with use of the product. 

 
We will continue to be subject to inspection by FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements.
 
Manufacturing cGMP Requirements
 
Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with FDA manufacturing requirements contained in FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) set forth in the quality system regulations promulgated under section 520 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the device must be reported to FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in device withdrawal. Device clearances or approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval. We expect to use contract manufacturers to manufacture our products for the foreseeable future we will therefore be dependent on their compliance with these requirements to market our products. We work closely with our contract manufacturers to assure that our products are in strict compliance with these regulations.
Laboratory Certification, Accreditation and Licensing
 
Our CLIA-certified laboratory is subject to U.S. and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories. CLIA requirements and laws of certain states, including those of California, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Florida, impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories, and establish standards for quality assurance and quality control, among other things. CLIA provides that a state may adopt different or more stringent regulations than federal law and permits states to apply for exemption from CLIA if the state’s laboratory laws are equivalent to, or more stringent than, CLIA. For example, the State of New York’s clinical laboratory regulations, which have received an exemption from CLIA, contain provisions that are in certain respects more stringent than federal law. Therefore, as long as New York maintains a licensure program that is CLIA-exempt, we will need to comply with New York’s clinical laboratory regulations in order to offer our clinical laboratory products and services in New York.
 
We have current certificates to perform clinical laboratory testing. Clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators and to sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements. Sanctions available under CLIA and certain state laws include prohibiting a laboratory from running tests, requiring a laboratory to implement a corrective plan, and imposing civil monetary penalties. If our CLIA-certified laboratory fails to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or state law, that failure could adversely affect any future CMS consideration of our technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense.

Other U.S. Healthcare Regulation
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 
Physician Payment Sunshine Act
 
There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. On February 8, 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, released its final rule implementing section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act that imposes new annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year, and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Manufacturers that produces at least one product reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or Children’s Health Insurance Program and (i) if the product is a drug or biological, and it requires a prescription (or physician’s authorization) to administer; or (ii) if the product is a device or medical supply, and it requires premarket approval or premarket notification by the FDA are required to comply with the Open Payments (commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act) filing requirements under CMS. We currently do not have any products covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or Children’s Health Insurance Program as none of our products have premarket approval or clearance notification. We expect once our products receive regulatory clearance, we will be required to comply with the Sunshine Act provisions.
 
Certain states, such as California and Connecticut, also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, and other states, such as Massachusetts and Vermont, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements.
 
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 
Managing the patient’s journey through our upcoming EsoGuard Telemedicine Program and our Lucid Test Centers consistent with the provisions of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute requires very careful coordination between us and our third-party telemedicine partners, which each entity operating within numerous standard operating procedures incorporated in our quality management system. We have established a costly and substantial regulatory and compliance infrastructure for the Lucid Test Centers and EsoGuard Telemedicine Program, including retaining multiple legal and regulatory consultants with specific expertise in this space, establishing and a special Quality & Compliance Committee of our board of directors to provide board-level oversight, and assuring that our contracts with our third-party telemedicine partners comply with the law.

Federal False Claims Act
 
The False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the False Claims Act. Several pharmaceutical, device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus noncovered uses.
 
The processing of EsoGuard tests and submissions of claims consistent with the provisions of the Federal False Claims Act, especially for patients who pass through our EsoGuard Telemedicine Program and our Lucid Test Centers, requires very careful coordination between us and our third-party telemedicine partners broadly operating within numerous standard operating procedures incorporated in our quality management system. We have established a costly and substantial regulatory and compliance infrastructure for the Lucid Test Centers and EsoGuard Telemedicine Program, including retaining multiple legal and regulatory consultants with specific expertise in this space, establishing and a special Quality & Compliance Committee of our board of directors to provide board-level oversight, and assuring that our contracts with our third-party telemedicine comply with the law.
 
The government may further prosecute, as a crime, conduct constituting a false claim under the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike civil claims under the False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim.
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the “FCPA,” prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
Healthcare Reform
 
Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products, or for the procedures associated with the use of our products, or limit coverage of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. Alternatively, the shift away from fee-for-service agreements to capitated payment models may support the value of our products which can be shown to decrease resource utilization and lead to cost saving-for both payors and providers.
 
HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HIPAA”) established comprehensive protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or “Covered Entities”: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities and their business associates must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. Some of our activities, including at our Lucid Test Centers and within our clinical trials, involve interactions with patients and their health information which implicate HIPAA. Our activities also involve us entering into specific kinds of relationships with Covered Entities and business associates of Covered Entities, which also implicate HIPAA. Penalties for violations of HIPAA include civil money and criminal penalties.
 
Our activities must also comply with other applicable privacy laws, which impose restrictions on the access, use and disclosure of personal information. More state and international privacy laws are being adopted. Many state laws are not preempted by HIPAA because they are more stringent or are broader in scope than HIPAA. Since 2020 we have also had to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which protects personal information other than health information covered by HIPAA. In the E.U., the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018 and imposes increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules. All of these laws may impact our business and may change periodically, which could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially costlier than under current requirements. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain stool, blood and other patient samples and associated patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.

Self-Referral Law
 
The federal “self-referral” law, commonly referred to as the “Stark” law, provides that physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with a laboratory are prohibited from making a referral to that laboratory for laboratory tests reimbursable by Medicare, and also prohibits laboratories from submitting a claim for Medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the testing laboratory. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions which, if met, permit physicians who have ownership or compensation arrangements with a testing laboratory to make referrals to that laboratory and permit the laboratory to submit claims for Medicare payments for laboratory tests performed pursuant to such referrals. We are subject to comparable state laws, some of which apply to all payors regardless of source of payment, and do not contain identical exceptions to the Stark law.
 
International Regulation
 
In order to market any of our products outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. We may be subject to regulations and product registration requirements in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
European Union
 
We recently received CE Mark certification for EsoCheck under MDD and completed CE Mark self-certification for EsoGuard, which qualifies as a General IVD, under IVDD, indicating that both may be marketed in CE Mark European countries, namely the European Economic Area (the European Union, Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein), Switzerland, and, until July 1, 2023, the United Kingdom.
 
MDD refers to Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, which for nearly three decades provided the essential requirements and conformity assessment procedure that medical devices must undergo to be affixed with a CE Mark and sold in CE Mark European countries. MDD is now obsolete and has been replaced by MDR. MDR refers to Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and incorporates several new concepts and registrations, stricter oversight of manufacturers by notified bodies, universal device identification (UDI) marking, and increased post-market surveillance requirements.
 
Similarly, IVDD refers to In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (98/79/EC), which for over twenty years has provided the essential requirements and conformity assessment procedure that in-vitro diagnostic medical devices must undergo to be affixed with a CE Mark and sold in CE Mark European countries. On May 26, 2022, IVDD will be replaced by IVDR, which refers to Regulation (EU) 2017/746, and has an expanded scope, risk-based classification, more rigorous clinical evidence and surveillance requirements, and more stringent documentation.
 
Both MDR and IVDR have sunset provisions for medical device and IVD certifications under MDD and IVD, respectively. Both EsoGuard and EsoCheck will require recertification under their stricter regulations in the coming years. Failure to secure these recertifications under MDR and IVDR will halt our ability to commercialize our products in the CE Mark European countries. As these are entirely new regulations, the cost, time and risk associated with these recertifications is difficult to predict.
 
In addition, the United Kingdom, which is a major target market for us, has left the European Union (“Brexit”) and will transition from CE Mark certification to its own UKCA mark certification. We will need to secure UKCA mark certification for EsoGuard and EsoCheck before their CE Mark certifications expire in the UK. Since this is an entirely new process, it is difficult to predict the cost, time and risk associated with transitioning to UKCA certification.
 
In the European Union, the manufacture of medical devices is subject to good manufacturing practice (GMP), as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines of the European Union and its member states. Compliance with GMP is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. Typically, quality system evaluation is performed by a Notified Body, which also recommends to the relevant competent authority for the European Community CE Marking of a device. The Competent Authority may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. Each device manufacturing facility must be audited on a periodic basis by the Notified Body. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product.
 
Any action against us for violation of these or similar foreign laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.

Other Laws
 
Occupational Safety and Health
 
In addition to its comprehensive regulation of health and safety in the workplace in general, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements aimed specifically at laboratories and other healthcare-related facilities. In addition, because our operations may require employees to use certain hazardous chemicals, we also must comply with regulations on hazard communication and hazardous chemicals in laboratories. These regulations require us, among other things, to develop written programs and plans, which must address methods for preventing and mitigating employee exposure, the use of personal protective equipment, and training.
Specimen Transportation
 
Our commercialization activities for EsoGuard subject us to regulations of the Department of Transportation, the United States Postal Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens.
Environmental
 
The cost of compliance with federal, state and local provisions related to the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our Diagnostics business. There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Employees
 
Currently, as of March 9, 2023 we have 74 employees (all of whom are full-time employees), inclusive of our executive officers –our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), our President and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), our Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), and our General Counsel and Secretary (“General Counsel”). In addition, we are obligated to reimburse PAVmed for certain payroll benefit and expenses related to our employees pursuant to the PBERA, which may be settled in shares of our common stock, at PAVmed’s election. No employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
