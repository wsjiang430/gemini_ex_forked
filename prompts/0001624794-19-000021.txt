ITEM 1: BUSINESS
General
CSWI is a diversified industrial growth company with well-established, scalable platforms and domain expertise across two business segments: Industrial Products and Specialty Chemicals. Our broad portfolio of leading products provides performance optimizing solutions to our customers. Our products include mechanical products for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (“HVAC/R”), sealants, building products, specialty mechanical products and high-performance specialty lubricants. Markets that we serve include HVAC/R, industrial, rail, plumbing, architecturally-specified building products, energy, mining and other general industrial markets. Our manufacturing operations are concentrated in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, but we also have distribution operations in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). Our products are sold directly to end users or through designated channels in over 100 countries around the world, including: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, the Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S.
Drawing on our innovative and proven technologies, we seek to deliver solutions to our professional customers that place a premium on superior performance and reliability. We believe our industrial brands are well-known in the specific industries we serve and have a reputation for high quality and reliability. We rely on both organic growth and acquisitions to provide an increasingly broad portfolio of performance optimizing solutions that meet our customers’ ever-changing needs. We have a successful record of making attractive, synergistic acquisitions in support of this objective, and we remain focused on identifying additional acquisition opportunities in our core markets.
Through our operating companies, we have a well-established legacy of providing high quality products accompanied by dependable service and attention to customer satisfaction. For example, our specialty lubricants were used on the excavation equipment for the Panama Canal. We also have a long history of innovation. We believe that we were the first to develop a method for removing internal acid from air conditioning and refrigeration systems, pioneering the market for acid neutralizers. We partner with our customers to solve specific challenges, such as environment-friendly lubricants, which were specifically developed to provide high performance in rail applications combined with biodegradability and no eco-toxicity and to satisfy strict environmental requirements.
CSWI is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 2014 in anticipation of CSWI's separation from Capital Southwest Corporation ("Capital Southwest"). However, our history dates back many decades through our well-established operating companies. The separation was executed on September 30, 2015 through a pro-rata share distribution of all the then outstanding shares of common stock of CSWI to the holders of common stock of Capital Southwest (the "Share Distribution"). Since the separation, CSWI has been an independent, publicly-traded company, listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. 
We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our SEC filings are available to the public through the Internet at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. We also make these filings available free of charge on our Internet website at www.cswindustrials.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file those documents with the SEC. The information on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference into, or otherwise made part of, this Annual Report.

New Product Development – Customer experience is a core competency in our Industrial Products segment. We gather "voice of the customer" market research through organized focus groups and online surveys, as well as through less formal channels. Ideas for new products or enhancements to existing products are also generated by our relationships with end users, independent sales representatives, distributors and our internal sales and marketing team. We also actively monitor the competitive landscape using a variety of methods. We develop new products and modify existing products in our research and development (“R&D”) labs in Houston, Texas; Rockwall, Texas; Boise, Idaho; Wichita, Kansas.
Competition – Our competition in the Industrial Products segment is varied. Competitors range from small entrepreneurial companies with a single product, to large multinational original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In the specialty mechanical products category, we compete with Diversitech, Supco, Little Giant, Mitsubishi, Cherne, Mainline and JR Smith. Most of our products are sold through distribution channels, and we compete in this channel based on breadth of product line, customer service and pricing. In the fire and smoke protection category, we compete with Won Door, Stoebich, McKeon and others, typically on the basis of product innovation, knowledge of building codes and customer service. In the architecturally-
specified building products category, we compete primarily with Emseal, Inpro, and MM Systems on the basis of product innovation, price and driving architectural specifications. In the lubricant storage, filtration and transfer space, we compete with Des-Case, Hy-Pro, IFH and others on the basis of superior performance, brand strength and breadth of product line.
Customers – Our primary customers for specialty mechanical products are HVAC/R, plumbing and electrical wholesalers and distributors. Some of these are single location distributors, but many are regional or national in scope with hundreds of locations. The majority of these products are sold domestically; however, a small portion is sold internationally through similar channels, and a small number of OEMs purchase these products directly. Fire and smoke protection products are sold through local building products distributors that also perform installations and service. Architecturally-specified building products are sold primarily through a network of distributors. Storage, filtration and application products are marketed and sold worldwide through a service-intensive distribution network.
Seasonality – A significant portion of our products are sold into the HVAC/R market, which is seasonal by nature. While products are sold throughout the year, sales tend to peak during the spring and summer months.
Specialty Chemicals
Our Specialty Chemicals segment manufactures and supplies highly specialized consumables that impart or enhance properties such as lubricity, anti-seize qualities, friction, sealing and heat control. In addition, the segment includes penetrants, pipe thread sealants, firestopping sealants and caulks and adhesives/solvent cements, which are primarily manufactured internally. These materials are typically used in harsh operating conditions, including extreme heat and pressure and chemical exposure, where commodity products would fail. These products protect and extend the working life of large capital equipment such as cranes, rail systems, mining equipment, oil rigs and rotating and grinding equipment found in various industrial segments such as steel mills, canning and bottling, mining and cement. Additionally, our Specialty Chemicals segment manufactures and supplies specialty products used in the HVAC/R and building markets. These products enhance, repair or condition the internal working systems of both industrial and residential systems and are critical to ensuring safe, efficient and effective long-term operational integrity. The Specialty Chemicals segment also supplies products and services into the water well treatment space, which includes testing services and diagnosis of current conditions, coupled with consumable solutions to resolve any identified problems. Our key product types and brand names are shown below:

PRODUCT TYPES | BRAND NAMES 
• railroad track lubricants, conditioners and positive friction consumables | • AC Leak Freeze® 
• oil field anti-seize products for drilling and conveyance piping | • BioRail® 
• open gear specialty lubricants for heavy equipment | • Deacon® 
• specialty lubricants for various industrial applications | • Decathlon™ 
• water well treatment products and services | • Envirolube® 
• chemical sealants to stop air-conditioning refrigerant leaks | • Gearmate® 
• engineered specialty thread sealants designed to seal and secure metal | • KATS® Coatings

• solvent cements and fire stop caulks | • Medallion™ 
 | • Metacaulk® 
 | • Paragon™ 
 | • Rail Armor® 
 | • RectorSeal No. 5® 
 | • Run-N-Seal® 
 | • Sterilene™ 
 | • Surtac® 
 | • T Plus 2® 
 | • TOR Armor® 
 | • Tru-Blu™ 
 | • Unicid™ 
 | • Well-Guard® 
 | • Whitcam® 

New Product Development – We develop relationships with end-users and channel partners to understand existing and new operating conditions where technical innovation or enhancement is needed. For example, these relationships have generated innovation in the areas of modifying existing lubrication products to operate in arctic conditions or modifying an existing product for use in an application where salt water may be present. The development teams located in Rockwall, Texas and Houston, Texas are also actively defining new end markets for product use and penetration.
Competition – In general, our products are specialty products, rather than commodity products, and competitors tend to be varied and include global, regional and local companies that may be large or small. We compete primarily on the basis of product differentiation, superior performance, quality and customer-centric service. The product sales cycle is often long when compared to many commodity consumables, resulting in verifiable and repeatable product performance being the key driver of buying decisions, rather than price. As these products protect and enhance the operation of large capital equipment, qualification is based on the proof of value in application, resulting in a high changeover risk barrier. Typical competitors include Shell, Castrol, Fuchs and Exxon-Mobil. Competitors of our sealants and adhesives products include Dow Corning Corporation, Henkel, 3M Company, Specified Technologies Inc. and Hilti. 
Customers – Specialty Chemicals products are primarily sold through value-added distribution partners, as well as maintenance and repair operations or catalog channels. Specialty Chemicals provides both market-specific and product line-specific training to both the distribution partners and potential end users. Our specialists often visit end users with our distribution partners to advise on critical application issues, which enhances our ability to both “pull” demand from the end-user and “push” demand to the distributor partner. Specialty Chemicals customers include petrochemical facilities, industrial manufacturers, construction, utilities, plant maintenance customers, building contractors and repair service companies.
Discontinued Operations
During the third quarter of the year ended March 31, 2018, we committed to a plan to divest our Strathmore Products business (the "Coatings business"). As a result, we reclassified the assets comprising that business to assets held-for-sale, and made a corresponding adjustment to our consolidated statements of operations to reflect discontinued operations for all periods presented. During the quarter ended September 30, 2018, we received an aggregate of $6.9 million for the sale of assets that related to our Coatings business in multiple transactions. 
Our Competitive Strengths
As discussed in this section, we believe we have a variety of competitive strengths.
Broad Portfolio of Industry Leading Products and Solutions
We have a broad portfolio of products with leading industry positions in our targeted end markets. We believe our products and solutions are differentiated from those of our competitors by superior performance, quality and total value delivered to customers. For example, RectorSeal No. 5® is widely regarded as an industry standard for thread sealants for HVAC/R, plumbing and electrical configurations. Additionally, we believe KOPR-KOTE® is recognized as the anti-seize compound of choice for use in oil and gas drilling operations, where it is requested by name.
Organic Revenue Growth Platform and Operating Performance
We focus on end markets with strong growth trends, continuously evaluating the potential uses of existing products to broaden our market penetration. We have a loyal customer base that recognizes the performance and quality of our products and solutions. Further, our customer base is diverse. For the year ended March 31, 2019, no single customer represented 10% or more of our net revenues.
These factors have enabled us to generate strong organic revenue growth performance, but we are also focused on continually improving our profitability through optimizing our manufacturing processes. This effort is supported by a culture of operational efficiency, where we continually look to refine processes in all of our manufacturing facilities to reduce manufacturing costs, increase production capacity and improve product quality. Additionally, we often evaluate strategic investments to drive transformational changes in our manufacturing processes. For example, in both of our reportable segments, we have taken actions to consolidate our manufacturing footprint in order to optimize capacity, improve efficiency and leverage technologies while enhancing product quality. 
Diverse Sales and Distribution Channels
Many of our products are sold through service-intensive distribution networks where product knowledge and customer satisfaction are key success factors. We primarily market through an international network of both internal and third-party sales representatives that call on our wholesale distributors, contractors and direct customers. The strong, long-term relationships we have developed with our wholesale distribution partners and exclusive dealers allow us to successfully introduce new products, including both newly developed and acquired products. In addition, our extensive distribution network allows us to reach and serve niche end markets that provide organic growth opportunities and form a key component of our acquisition strategy.
Focus on Inorganic Growth Investment with Proven Track Record
We believe our experience in identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions is one of our core competitive strengths, as evidenced by over 30 acquisitions that we have successfully completed since 1991. Historically, we have pursued product-line acquisitions with relatively low integration risk that have the potential to benefit from our extensive distribution network and manufacturing efficiencies. More recently, we began targeting commercially-proven products and solutions that are attractive in our existing end markets, or that provide entry into new, complementary end markets where we can drive revenue growth and improved profitability and free cash flow. 
In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 and in early fiscal year 2020, we acquired two companies: MSD Research, Inc., including its leading All-Access™ line of air conditioning condensate switches and line cleanouts; and Petersen Metals, a designer, manufacturer and installer of engineered railings and safety systems for institutional and commercial structures in the Southeast U.S. We invested a total of approximately $22 million for both acquisitions. We did not complete any acquisitions during the year ended March 31, 2018. We completed one acquisition during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, where we acquired Greco Aluminum Railings, a leading manufacturer of high-quality engineered railing and safety systems for multi-family and commercial structures. 
Culture of Product Enhancement and Customer Centric Solutions
Our highly-trained and specialized personnel work closely with our customers, industry experts and research partners to continuously improve our existing products to meet evolving customer and market requirements. We focus on product enhancements and product line extensions that are designed to meet the specific application needs of our customers. We believe this focus has helped us build strong industrial brands and develop a reputation for high quality, in turn leading us to realize improved customer retention and loyalty. Further, our ability to meet the needs of high-value, niche end markets with customized solutions that leverage our existing products has enabled us to differentiate ourselves from larger competitors that may not be as willing or able to respond quickly to evolving customer demands.
Our Growth Strategy
We are focused on creating long-term stockholder value by increasing our revenue, profitability and free cash flow. To that end, we focus on strategic end markets that yield sustainable growth and on expanding market share by growing the portfolio of products through new product development and targeted acquisitions. As discussed below, we believe there are three key drivers of our growth. 
We Leverage Existing Customer Relationships and Products and Solutions
We expect to drive revenue growth by leveraging our reputation for providing high quality products to our long-standing customer base. Our team of sales representatives, engineers and other technical personnel continues to proactively collaborate with our distributors and end users to enhance and adapt existing products and solutions to meet evolving customer needs. In addition, we seek to leverage our existing customer base to cross-sell our products and solutions across our two business segments, thereby driving organic growth.
We Innovate New Products to Accelerate Organic Growth

The collaborative relationships and open feedback channels we have with our distributors and end users allow us to add value not only through enhancing and adapting existing products and solutions, but also through efficiently developing new products and solutions to meet existing and future customer needs. Our research and development, sales and marketing personnel work together to identify product opportunities and methodically pursue development of innovative new products. Through developing new products and solutions to both address new markets and complement our product portfolio in markets we currently serve, we create increased opportunities to drive organic growth.
We Invest in Focused Acquisitions that Leverage our Distribution Channels
While we are focused on new product development, improving our existing products and penetrating new markets with these products, we expect to continue to identify and execute acquisitions that will broaden our portfolio of products and offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. We primarily focus on commercially proven products and solutions that would benefit from a broader distribution network and are attractive to customers in our targeted end markets. Once acquired, we strive to utilize our extensive distribution networks to increase revenue by selling those products and solutions to our diversified customer base.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Our products are manufactured using various raw materials, including base oils, copper flake, aluminum, polyvinyl chloride and tetra-hydrofuran. These raw materials are available from numerous sources. We do not depend on a single source of supply for any significant amount of raw materials and we do not anticipate significant shortages of such materials in the future. We generally purchase raw materials and components as needed. 
Intellectual Property
We own and maintain a substantial portfolio of trademarks and patents relating to the names and designs of our products. We consider our trademarks and patents to be valuable assets. In addition, our pool of proprietary information, consisting of know-how and trade secrets related to the design, manufacture and operation of our products, is considered particularly valuable. Accordingly, we take proactive measures to protect proprietary information. In aggregate, we own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell and are not materially encumbered by licensing or franchise agreements. Our trademarks can typically be renewed indefinitely as long as they remain in use, whereas our patents generally expire 10 to 20 years from the dates they were filed. Our patents expire from time to time, but we do not believe that the expiration of any individual patent will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Export Regulations
We are subject to export control regulations in countries from which we export products and services. These controls may apply by virtue of the country in which the products are located or by virtue of the origin of the content contained in the products. The level of control generally depends on the nature of the goods and services in question. Where controls apply, we typically need an export license or authorization (either on a per-product or per transaction basis) or the transaction must qualify for a license exception or the equivalent. In certain cases corresponding reporting requirements may apply. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for financial and other information regarding our operations on a geographical basis.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to certain foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, labor and health and safety matters. Management believes that our business is operated in material compliance with all such regulations. To date, the cost of such compliance has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position or that of our operating subsidiaries. While we have implemented policies, practices and procedures to prevent and mitigate risks, violations may occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Further, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted.
Employees
As of March 31, 2019, we employed approximately 730 individuals within our continuing operations. Of these employees, 22 are represented by unions. We believe relations with our employees throughout our operations are generally positive, including those employees represented by unions. No unionized facility accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended March 31, 2019.
