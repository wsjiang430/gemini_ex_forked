Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Proto Labs, Inc. was incorporated in Minnesota in 1999. The terms “Proto Labs,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” as used herein refer to the business and operations of Proto Labs, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We are the world’s largest and fastest digital manufacturer of custom prototypes and on-demand production parts. Our mission is to help companies accelerate product development, reduce risk, and optimize supply chains by providing quality prototyping and on-demand manufacturing services at unprecedented speeds. Our automated quoting and manufacturing systems allow us to produce commercial-grade plastic, metal, and liquid silicone rubber parts within days. We manufacture prototype and low volume production parts for companies worldwide, who are under increasing pressure to bring their finished products to market faster than their competition. We utilize injection molding, computer numerical control (CNC) machining, 3D printing and sheet metal fabrication to manufacture custom parts for our customers. Our proprietary technology eliminates most of the time-consuming and expensive skilled labor conventionally required to quote and manufacture parts. Our customers conduct nearly all of their business with us over the Internet. We target our products to the millions of product developers and engineers who use three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) software to design products across a diverse range of end-markets. We have established our operations in the United States, Europe and Japan, which we believe are three of the largest geographic markets where these product developers and engineers are located. We believe our use of advanced technology enables us to offer significant advantages at competitive prices to many customers and is the primary reason we have become a leading supplier of custom parts.
 
We believe prototype and low volume custom parts manufacturing has historically been an underserved market due to the inefficiencies inherent in the quotation, equipment set-up and non-recurring engineering processes required to produce custom parts. Our customers typically order short run custom parts for a variety of reasons, including:
 

● | they need a prototype to confirm the form, fit and function of one or more components of a product under development;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | they need an initial supply of parts to support pilot production for testing of a product; 
● | they need an initial supply of parts to support production while their high-volume production mold is being prepared;
● | they need to meet their customers' variable demand for custom parts in a competitive timeframe; 
● | their product will only be released in a limited quantity; or 
● | they need to support end-of-life production in a cost-effective manner. 

 
In each of these instances, we believe our solution provides product developers, engineers, and supply chains with an exceptional combination of speed, quality, competitive pricing, ease of use and reliability that they typically cannot find among conventional custom parts manufacturers. Our technology enables us to ship parts as soon as the same day after receipt of a customer’s design submission.
 
Our primary manufacturing product lines currently include Injection Molding, CNC Machining, 3D Printing and Sheet Metal. We continually seek to expand the range of size and geometric complexity of the parts we can make with these processes, to extend the variety of materials we are able to support and to identify additional manufacturing processes to which we can apply our technology in order to better serve the evolving preferences and needs of product developers and engineers.
 
We have experienced significant growth since our inception in 1999. We have grown our total revenue from $209.6 million in 2014 to $445.6 million in 2018. We have grown our net income from $41.6 million in 2014 to $76.6 million in 2018.
 
Our increases in revenue and income from operations can be attributed to expanding our customer base, broadening our parts envelope, and launching new manufacturing technologies. We were founded in 1999 with plastic injection molding, and have expanded our product lines over the years by the introduction of:
 

● | CNC machining in 2007; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | liquid silicon rubber (LSR) and lathe manufacturing processes that expanded the breadth and scope of our injection molding and CNC machining product lines in 2014; 
● | 3D printing, including stereolithography (SL), selective laser sintering (SLS), and direct metal laser sintering (DMLS), through our acquisition of FineLine Prototyping, Inc. (FineLine) in 2014 and expanded through our acquisition of certain assets of Alphaform AG (Alphaform) in 2015;
● | rapid overmolding technology in 2016 and insert molding technology in 2017, both of which expanded the breadth of our manufacturing capabilities in our Injection Molding product line; 
● | PolyJet and Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) in 2017, which expanded the processes with which we produce 3D printed parts; 

 
 5



● | injection molding commercial offerings tailored to on-demand manufacturing customers in 2017; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | sheet metal fabrication capability through our acquisition of RAPID Manufacturing Group, LLC (RAPID) in 2017; and
● | expanded CNC machining capabilities for larger and more complex parts through our acquisition of RAPID in 2017. 

Industry Overview
 
Our Industry
 
We serve product developers and engineers worldwide who bring new ideas to market in the form of products containing one or more custom parts. Many of these product developers and engineers use 3D CAD software to create digital models representing their custom part designs that are then used to create physical parts for concept modeling, prototyping, functional testing, market evaluation or production. Custom prototype parts play a critical role in the product development process, as they provide product developers and engineers with the ability to test and confirm their intended performance requirements and explore design alternatives.
 
Early in the product development process, 3D printing processes such as SL and PolyJet can be used to quickly produce an approximate physical representation of a part, but these representations may not meet product developers’ and engineers’ requirements for material properties. As an alternative, injection molding, CNC machining, sheet metal, and 3D printing processes such as SLS, DMLS, and MJF can be used to produce low volumes of high-quality custom parts in either metal or plastic. For follow-on functional testing, market evaluation and production runs, parts are typically manufactured using injection molding, CNC machining and sheet metal fabrication.
 
Our Solution
 
We have developed proprietary software and advanced manufacturing processes that automate much of the skilled labor conventionally required in quoting, production engineering and manufacturing of custom parts. We believe our interactive web-based interface and highly automated processes address the desires of many product developers and engineers for a fast, efficient and cost-effective means to obtain custom parts, and are the primary reasons we have become a leading supplier of custom parts.
 
Key elements of our solution include:
 
Sophisticated Technology that Reduces Turnaround Time
 
Our digital model is centered on our web-based interface and proprietary software, which automate many of the manual and time-consuming processes typically required to obtain custom parts from conventional suppliers. Our platform automates many aspects of the entire process from design submission through manufacturability analysis and feedback, quotation, order submission, mold design, tool path generation, mold or part manufacture and digital inspection. To utilize our platform, a prospective customer uploads a 3D CAD file of their required part through our website. Often within minutes of design submission, our software analyzes the design, assesses the manufacturability of the design and our ability to make the part, and returns a firm price quotation with any recommendations for design modifications. Many of our customers find this analysis particularly helpful, as it diagnoses and prevents potential problems prior to manufacturing. We can also provide a flow analysis to identify design flaws that limit the ability to manufacture a quality part.
 
Our quoting system is highly interactive, enabling our prospective customers to change the material, finish, quantity or shipping schedule of orders, and to instantly receive an updated quotation. Once an order is received, our software automates much of the manual engineering and skilled labor that is normally required to manufacture parts. As a result, in many cases we are able to quote orders in minutes and ship parts as soon as the same day ordered.
 
Scale to Process Large Numbers of Unique Part Designs
 
Our proprietary, highly scalable quoting technology addresses the manual processes conventionally involved in submitting a design, analyzing its manufacturability, making design revision recommendations and generating price quotations. This enables us to quickly analyze high volumes of 3D CAD part design submissions and provide feedback to our prospective product developer and engineer customers. In 2018 alone, we generated quotations for over 1,100,000 design submissions. Our proprietary manufacturing automation technology is also highly scalable, enabling us to process large numbers of unique designs and, combined with our manufacturing processes, efficiently and effectively manufacture high volumes of parts to meet the needs of product developers and engineers.
 
 6


Enhanced Customer Experience
 
Our web-based customer interface provides a straightforward means of submitting 3D CAD part designs. Our proprietary manufacturability analysis then quickly analyzes whether a part design falls within our manufacturing capabilities. In many cases, our software provides suggested design modifications to enhance manufacturability, which is presented to the product developer or engineer in an interactive quotation containing a color-coded 3D representation of the part. This allows product developers and engineers to quickly determine the manufacturability of their parts, understand the cost and when they can be shipped. Our interactive quotations provide instant visibility into the impact of changing an order’s various parameters such as material, finish, quantity or shipping schedule. As a result, we provide product developers and engineers with an easy-to-use and consistent means to obtain custom parts.
Attractive Custom Pricing
 
Based on internal market research, we believe we generally have competitive pricing on custom orders. We believe this, combined with speed, is a direct result of our technology and the efficiency of our operations, both of which were designed specifically for lower volume runs of custom parts production. By limiting these costs, we can typically offer attractive pricing not normally possible in the low volume, high mix custom parts market, and as a result, we can typically offer product developers and engineers competitive prices on custom manufactured parts. 
Our Product Lines
 
Our Injection Molding, CNC Machining, 3D Printing and Sheet Metal product lines offer many product developers and engineers the ability to quickly and efficiently outsource their quick-turn custom parts manufacturing. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for the historical revenue generated by each of Injection Molding, CNC Machining, 3D Printing and Sheet Metal.
Injection Molding
 
Our Injection Molding product line uses our 3D CAD-to-CNC machining technology for the automated design and manufacture of molds, which are then used to produce custom plastic and liquid silicone rubber injection-molded parts and over-molded and insert-molded injection-molded parts on commercially available equipment. Our Injection Molding product line works best for on-demand production, bridge tooling, pilot runs and functional prototyping. Our affordable aluminum molds and quick turnaround times help reduce design risk and limit overall production costs for product developers and engineers. Prototype quantities typically range from 25 to 100 parts. Because we retain possession of the molds, customers who need short-run production often come back to Proto Labs’ Injection Molding product line for additional quantities. They do so to support pilot production for product testing, while their tooling for high-volume production is being prepared, because they need on-demand manufacturing due to disruptions in their manufacturing process, because their product requires limited annual quantity or because they need end-of-life production support. In 2017, we launched an on-demand manufacturing injection molding service. This service utilizes our existing processes, but is designed to fulfill the needs of customers with on-going production needs, typically in annual volumes of less than 10,000 parts.
 
CNC Machining
 
Our CNC Machining product line uses commercially available CNC machines to offer milling and turning. CNC milling is a manufacturing process that cuts plastic and metal blocks into one or more custom parts based on the 3D CAD model uploaded by the product developer or engineer. CNC turning with live tooling combines both lathe and mill capabilities to machine parts with cylindrical features from metal rod stock. Our efficiencies derive from the automation of the programming of these machines and a proprietary fixturing process. Quick-turn CNC machining works best for prototyping, form and fit testing, jigs and fixtures and functional components for end-use applications. The CNC Machining product line is well suited to produce small quantities, typically in the range of one to 1,000 parts.
 
3D Printing
 
Our 3D Printing product line includes SL, SLS, DMLS, MJF and PolyJet processes, which offers customers a wide-variety of high-quality, precision rapid prototyping and low volume production. These processes create parts with a high level of accuracy, detail, strength and durability. Industrial 3D Printing is best suited for functional prototypes, complex designs and end-use applications. 3D Printing is well suited to produce small quantities, typically in the range of one to 50 parts.
 
 7


Sheet Metal
 
Our Sheet Metal product line includes quick-turn and e-commerce-enabled custom sheet metal parts, providing customers with prototype and low-volume production parts. The rapid prototype sheet metal process is most often used when form, fit and function are all a priority. Our manufacturing process uses customer 3D CAD models uploaded by the product developer or engineer to fabricate quick turn prototype sheet metal or short run production parts. The Sheet Metal product line is well suited to produce quantities in the range of one to 500 parts.
Our Process
 

The process for Injection Molding begins when the product developer or engineer uploads one or more 3D CAD models representing the desired part geometry through our website. Our proprietary software uses complex algorithms to analyze the 3D CAD geometry, analyze its manufacturability and support the creation of an interactive, web-based quotation containing pricing and manufacturability information. A link to the quotation is then e-mailed to the product developer or engineer, who can access the quotation, change a variety of order parameters and instantly see the effect on price before finalizing the order. Our proprietary software supports the creation of the mold design and the tool paths required to manufacture the mold components, which are then routed to our CNC machining centers for execution. Once the mold is assembled, it is placed in one of our injection molding presses to create the required parts. Parts are shipped in as little as one business day from design submission. We ship our parts via small parcel common carriers on standard terms and conditions. Our other services have similar processes, but differ mainly due to the nature of the manufacturing processes on which each service is based.

Our Growth Strategy
 
The principal elements of our growth strategy are to:
 
Expand the Customer Base
 
We plan to expand our customer base to serve more product developers and engineers within the companies that have already used our product lines. Individual product developers and engineers typically make or influence the choice of vendor when sourcing custom parts. We believe a significant opportunity exists for us to leverage highly satisfied product developers and engineers to encourage others within the same organization to utilize our product lines. We have historically gained a significant number of new customers through word-of-mouth referrals from other product developers and engineers, and combine these referrals with the efforts of our marketing and sales force to identify and market our product lines to the colleagues of our existing customers.
 
We also plan to use our marketing and sales capabilities to continue to pursue product developers and engineers within companies who have not yet used our products. Our presence in geographic regions that have high populations of 3D CAD users provides us with a broad universe of potential new customer companies on which to focus our marketing and sales efforts.
 
We believe there may be opportunities to grow by identifying and expanding into select additional geographic markets. We currently operate in the United States, Europe and Japan, where we believe a substantial portion of the world’s product developers and engineers are located. We entered the European market in 2005 and launched operations in Japan in 2009. For 2018, revenue earned in these markets represents approximately 21.3% of our total revenue. While we currently do not have specific plans to expand into any particular geographic markets, we believe opportunities exist to serve the needs of product developers and engineers in select new geographic regions and we will continue to evaluate such opportunities if and when they arise.
 
We plan to further enhance the functionality and ease of use of our platform and expand the capabilities of our technology in order to further increase automation and meet the evolving needs of product developers and engineers worldwide. We believe product developers and engineers have come to expect advanced web-based tools and a fully integrated Internet platform from their vendors. We will continue to use the Internet to provide product developers and engineers with a standardized interface through which they can upload their 3D CAD models and obtain firm, interactive quotations quickly and efficiently.
 
Launch New Manufacturing Technology
 
We seek to identify additional manufacturing processes to which we can apply our digital technology and expertise to meet a greater range of product developers’ and engineers’ needs. Introducing new manufacturing processes can both attract new customers and provide us with a significant opportunity to cross-sell our existing product lines to our existing customer base. We regularly evaluate new manufacturing processes to offer product developers and engineers and introduce such new processes when we are confident that a sufficient market demand exists and that we can offer the same advantages our customers have come to expect from us.
 
We were founded with Injection Molding which represents 47.2% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Examples of new manufacturing services we have added include CNC Machining, 3D Printing and Sheet Metal. Our CNC Machining product line was first introduced in the United States and Europe in 2007, expanded to Japan in 2009, and further expanded in the United States through our acquisition of RAPID in November 2017. CNC Machining represents 34.5% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 3D printing technologies were introduced through our acquisition of FineLine in April 2014. We further expanded our 3D printing capabilities in October 2015 through our acquisition of Alphaform. Our 3D product line represents 12.0% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our Sheet Metal product line was introduced through our acquisition of RAPID in November 2017 and represents 5.6% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
We continue to expand our core product lines through product line extensions including liquid silicone rubber injection molding, lathe-turned parts, rapid overmolding, insert molding, PolyJet and MJF. We introduced liquid silicone rubber injection molding during 2014 and in 2015, we introduced lathe-turned products. In 2016, we expanded the breadth of our manufacturing capabilities by adding rapid overmolding technology. In 2017, we added insert molding to our Injection Molding product line and PolyJet and MJF to our 3D Printing product line. In addition, we launched on-demand manufacturing to address the needs of the low-volume, high-mix product segment. We also opened our first metrology lab in 2017 for enhanced inspection reporting on end-use production parts, including First Article Inspection Reports and digital inspection reports.

Broaden the Parts Envelope
 
We regularly analyze the universe of customer design submissions that we are currently unable to manufacture and focus a portion of our research and development efforts to expand the range of parts that we can produce. Since we first introduced our Injection Molding product line in 1999, we have steadily expanded the size and geometric complexity of the injection-molded parts we are able to manufacture, and we continue to extend the diversity of materials we are able to support. Similarly, since first introducing our CNC Machining product line in 2007, we have expanded the range of part sizes, design geometries and materials we can support. In 2017, we launched two new 3D Printing processes, which strengthened our capability to manufacture complex part geometries quickly and accurately. Through our acquisition of RAPID in November 2017, we added quick-turn and e-commerce-enabled Sheet Metal services to our portfolio and expanded our CNC Machining capabilities to support larger and more complex projects. As we continue to expand the range of our existing process capabilities, we believe we will meet the needs of a broader set of product developers and engineers and consequently convert a higher number of quotation requests into orders.
Marketing
 
Our global marketing effort generates prospects for our sales teams and seeks to strengthen our reputation as an industry leader in digital manufacturing services for custom prototyping and low-volume manufacturing. Since we are an agile, technology-based company, much of our marketing activities occur online. We use marketing automation software to enhance the productivity of our marketing and sales teams and continuously track the results of every campaign to ensure our return on investment.
 
We maintain top-of-mind brand awareness with product developers and engineers through regular publication of technical information including design guidelines and helpful tips, engineering white papers, educational webinars, quick videos, and a quarterly journal focused on important industry topics. We also provide complimentary physical design aids to designers and engineers — as well as teachers and students — that highlight technical aspects of injection molding to help create efficient, well-designed parts. We believe these educational materials are key aspects of our lead generation efforts.
 
Marketing represents the face of Proto Labs, so it is our goal to actively and intelligently engage designers and engineers across multiple mediums — whether print, online, social media or in person. By doing this, we gain new customers, drive sales and build brand equity.
 
Sales and Customer Service
 
We maintain an internal sales team trained in the basics of part design and the capabilities of our manufacturing product lines, as well as the key advantages of our processes over alternate methods of custom parts manufacturing. We organize our sales team into complementary roles: business development, account management and strategic account management, with the former focused on selling to new customer companies within targeted market segments and the latter two focused on expanding sales within existing customer companies.
 
We believe our sales staff is adept at researching customer companies and networking to find additional product developers and engineers who may have a need for our products. We also have a team of customer service engineers who can support highly technical engineering discussions with product developers and engineers as required during the sales process. Our revenue is generated from a diverse customer base, with no single customer company representing more than 2% of our total revenue in 2018.
 
Competition
 
The market for custom parts manufacturing is fragmented, highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include:
 

● | Captive in-house product manufacturing. Many larger companies undertaking product development have established additive rapid prototyping (3D printing), CNC machining, injection molding or sheet metal capabilities internally to support prototyping or manufacturing requirements of their product developers and engineers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Other custom parts manufacturers. There are thousands of alternative manufacturing machine shops, injection molding suppliers, sheet metal fabricators, and 3D printing service bureaus and vendors worldwide. The size and scale of these businesses range from very small specialty shops to large, high-volume production manufacturers.

 
We believe that the key competitive factors in our industry include:
 

● | Quality: dimensional accuracy, surface finish, material properties, color and cleanliness;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Speed: turnaround time for quotations and parts; 

 
 10



● | Reliability: greater than 97% on-time delivery; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Service: overall customer experience, from web interface to post-sales support; 
● | Capability: range of part sizes and dimensional complexities supported, variety of manufacturing processes offered, materials supported and post-processing provided;
● | Scale: ability to support thousands of part designs in parallel; 
● | Capacity: ability to manage peaks in demand with very short lead times and no minimum order quantities; and 
● | Price: mold and part pricing. 

 
We believe that our digital end-to-end manufacturing capability positions us favorably and has enabled us to become a leader in our markets. We also believe that substantially all of our current direct competitors are relatively small in terms of size of operations, revenue, number of customers and volume of parts sold, and generally lack our technological capabilities. However, our industry is evolving rapidly and other companies, including potentially larger and more established companies with developed technological capabilities, may begin to focus on low volume, high mix custom parts manufacturing. These companies could more directly compete with us, along with our existing competitors, and could also launch new products and product lines that we do not offer that may quickly gain market acceptance. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our ability to attract customers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our patents, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade secrets, copyrights, domain names and other intellectual property as valuable to our business and rely on patent, trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, vendors and others to protect our proprietary rights. We register our patents, trademarks and service marks in the United States and other jurisdictions as we deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2018, we owned and had applications pending for patents relating to various aspects of our quoting and manufacturing processes as follows:

Jurisdiction | Issued Patents | Applications Pending
United States | 18 | 11 
United Kingdom | 2 | 0 
Germany | 0 | 2 

 
Our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2032. We also owned approximately 20 registered and 3 pending United States trademarks or service marks as of December 31, 2018, with corresponding registered protection in Europe and Japan for the most important of these marks such as PROTO LABS, PROTOMOLD, FIRSTCUT, PROTOQUOTE, FIRSTQUOTE, PROTOFLOW and FINELINE, corresponding approved protection in Canada for PROTO LABS, FIRSTCUT and FINELINE, and corresponding registered protection in Australia, Canada and Mexico for PROTOMOLD. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate such rights. We have been subject to claims and expect to be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. In particular, we may face claims from third parties that we have infringed their patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018 we had 2,487 full-time employees. We also regularly use independent contractors and other temporary employees across the organization to augment our regular staff. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.
