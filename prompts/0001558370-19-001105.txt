 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
     We are a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing treatments for patients suffering from severe neurological diseases. We focus on neurological diseases where we believe an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, gene therapy approach that either increases or decreases the production of a specific protein can slow or reduce the symptoms experienced by patients, and therefore have a clinically meaningful impact. We have built a gene therapy platform that we believe positions us to be a leading company at the intersection of AAV gene therapy and severe neurological disease. Our gene therapy platform enables us to engineer, optimize, manufacture and deliver our AAV-based gene therapies that have the potential to provide durable efficacy following a single administration. 
 Additionally, we are working to identify novel AAV capsids, which are the outer viral protein shells that enclose the genetic material of the virus payload. Our team of experts in the fields of AAV gene therapy and neuroscience first identifies and selects severe neurological diseases that are well-suited for treatment using AAV gene therapy. We then engineer and optimize AAV vectors for delivery of the virus payload to the targeted tissue or cells. Our manufacturing process employs an established system that we believe will enable production of high quality AAV vectors at commercial-scale. In addition to our capsid optimization efforts, we leverage novel delivery paradigms, established routes of administration, and advances in dosing techniques to optimize delivery of our AAV gene therapies to target tissues, regions and cell types that are critical to the disease of interest. We believe we can achieve this directly, with targeted infusions to discrete regions of the brain or spinal cord, or systemically, in conjunction with our novel capsids.
 Our business strategy focuses on discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing our gene therapy programs. As part of this strategy, we have developed core competencies specific to AAV gene therapy development and manufacturing and are beginning to build our commercial infrastructure. This business strategy also includes business development activities that may include in-licensing activities or partnering certain programs in specific geographies

with collaborators, as we have demonstrated through our collaborations, including those with Sanofi Genzyme, AbbVie, and Neurocrine. Since our inception, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, determining which neurological diseases to pursue, advancing our product candidates including delivery and manufacturing, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock, public offerings of our common stock, our collaboration with Sanofi Genzyme, or the Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration, which commenced in February 2015 and our collaboration with AbbVie focusing on tau-related diseases, or the AbbVie Tau Collaboration, which commenced in February 2018. Additionally, we recently entered into collaborations with Neurocrine, or the Neurocrine Collaboration, which we expect to commence in the first half of 2019, and with AbbVie focusing on pathological species of alpha-synuclein, or the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration.    Our pipeline of gene therapy programs is summarized in the table below: 

 Our pipeline consists of programs for severe neurological indications, including Parkinson’s disease; a monogenic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS; Huntington’s disease; Friedreich’s ataxia; tau-related diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, and progressive supranuclear palsy; or PSP, Alpha-synuclein related diseases for Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies; and severe, chronic pain. We may seek orphan drug designation, breakthrough therapy designation, or other expedited review processes for certain of our product candidates in the United States, Europe, and Japan. 
 Our most advanced clinical candidate, VY-AADC for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, is being evaluated for safety and efficacy of escalating doses in an open-label, Phase 1b clinical trial. We have completed enrolling the Phase 1b trial of VY-AADC and continue to monitor results. Preliminary data from Cohorts 1 through 3 from this trial were reported beginning in late 2016 and most recently in November 2018.

In December 2018, we announced randomization of the first patient in our RESTORE-1 Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-surgery controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of VY-AADC for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease in patients with motor fluctuations that are refractory to medical management. The RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial will enroll patients who have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease for at least four years, are not responding adequately to oral medications, and have at least three or more hours of OFF time during the day as measured by a validated self-reported patient diary. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized (1:1) to one-time administration of VY-AADC (for a total dose of up to 2.5×1012 vector genomes, or vg) or placebo surgery. 
 We are pursuing additional product candidates in the preclinical stages of development, including treatment programs for ALS, Huntington’s disease, Friedreich’s ataxia, tau-related neurodegenerative diseases and the treatment of severe, chronic pain. If preclinical studies prove successful, we plan to file investigational new drug, or IND, applications for our ALS and Huntington’s disease programs during 2019. 
 In late 2017, we initiated additional preclinical studies to further optimize our ALS program’s therapeutic approach, including exploration of additional routes of administration and novel AAV capsids in large animal models. VY-SOD102, our clinical candidate for the treatment of a monogenic form of ALS, is composed of an adeno-associated virus capsid and a proprietary transgene that selectively knocks down, or reduces, levels of SOD1 mRNA. VY-SOD102 has the potential to durably reduce the levels of toxic mutant SOD1 protein in the spinal cord to slow the progression of disease. In late 2018, we presented data on VY-SOD102 administered with a novel delivery paradigm comprising a one-time, intraparenchymal infusion after laminectomy to the cervical spinal cord of the mini-pig, which has a spinal cord similar in length and diameter to the human spinal cord. This delivery approach yielded safe and significant reduction of SOD1 at 4 weeks post-dosing at the site of the infusion and throughout the spinal cord, most notably in the cervical and thoracic regions critical for respiratory function. Further preclinical studies are underway with VY-SOD102 which, if successful, will support a potential filing of an IND application in 2019.
 In 2017, we selected VY-HTT01 as our clinical candidate for the treatment of Huntington’s disease. Recent preclinical delivery studies have further optimized the dosing paradigm to support filing of a potential IND application. VY-HTT01 is composed of an adeno-associated virus capsid (AAV1) and proprietary transgene that harnesses the RNA interference pathway to selectively knock down, or reduce, levels of HTT mRNA. In late 2018, we presented results demonstrating significant reduction of HTT mRNA at five weeks post-dosing in adult non-human primates using a magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, guided surgical delivery of VY-HTT01 and a novel delivery paradigm targeting both the putamen and thalamus. Targeting the thalamus in addition to the putamen leverages more extensive and more preserved neuronal pathways to the cortex than delivery to the putamen alone. This novel dosing paradigm with VY-HTT01 resulted in safe and significant suppression of HTT in the striatum and in cortical neurons, which are critical in the progression of disease. Further preclinical studies are underway with VY-HTT01 which, if successful, will support a potential filing of an IND application in 2019.
 Additional preclinical studies are underway including steps to optimize a lead clinical candidate for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia. Additionally, we are collaborating with AbbVie on the research and development of specified vectorized antibody compounds comprised of an AAV or other viral capsid and a virus vector genome that encodes one or more antibodies that target and bind to a tau protein. We are also conducting proof-of-concept studies on our VY-NAV01 program for the treatment of severe, chronic pain. 
 In January 2019, we announced the Neurocrine Collaboration focused on the development and commercialization of our VY-AADC gene therapy program for Parkinson’s disease and VY-FXN01 gene therapy program for Friedreich’s ataxia, as well as rights to two programs to be determined. Agreements related to the Neurocrine Collaboration including the collaboration and license agreement are subject to certain conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary closing conditions. We expect our work to commence under the Neurocrine Collaboration in the first half of 2019. In February 2019, we announced the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration to develop and commercialize vectorized antibodies directed at pathological species of alpha-synuclein for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other diseases characterized by the abnormal accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein, or synucleinopathies.

 In addition to the programs described above, we continue to evaluate additional severe neurological diseases that could be treated using AAV gene therapy through application of either a gene replacement or a gene knockdown approach and are also actively exploring additional potential treatment methods that can utilize an AAV vector.
 Finally, we developed our own real-time, intra-operative, MRI compatible device, the Variable Trajectory Array Guide, or V-TAG™, that can be used with other neuro-navigational systems for the administration of drug to the putamen and other surgical procedures to avoid blood vessels and reduce the risk of potential hemorrhage during surgery and to maximize drug coverage of the putamen. In July 2018, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or the CDRH, of the FDA provided 510(k) clearance for V-TAG. We are currently working with a collaborator on process development and manufacturing of the device. Investigators have used an alternative MRI-compatible device called the ClearPoint® System in our Phase 1b clinical trial of VY-AADC and Phase 1 posterior trajectory trial. We expect to use both our own V-TAG and the ClearPoint System in our RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial.
 Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration
 In February 2015, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Sanofi Genzyme to leverage our combined expertise and assets to develop AAV gene therapies for certain severe neurological diseases. Under the agreement, we received $65.0 million in upfront cash, a $30.0 million upfront equity investment, and an in-kind commitment of $5.0 million, totaling $100.0 million. At the inception of the agreement, we were eligible to receive up to $745.0 million in option and milestone payments while retaining U.S. commercial rights to most programs. Under the terms of the collaboration, we granted Sanofi Genzyme an exclusive option (i) to license, develop and commercialize ex-U.S. rights to the VY-AADC program, VY-FXN01, VY-HTT01, and a future program to be designated by Sanofi Genzyme, which we refer to collectively as the Split Territory Programs; (ii) to license, develop and commercialize worldwide rights to VY-SMN101; and (iii) to co-commercialize VY-HTT01 in the United States. Each of Sanofi Genzyme’s options to a Split Territory Program is triggered following the completion of the first proof-of-principle human clinical study, or POP Study, on a program-by-program basis.
 In October 2017, Sanofi Genzyme notified us that it had decided not to exercise its option for the ex-U.S. rights to VY-AADC for Parkinson’s disease. As a result, we are no longer entitled to receive $45.0 million and $60.0 million of regulatory and commercial milestone payments from Sanofi Genzyme, respectively, related to the Parkinson’s program under the Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration. If we use certain Sanofi Genzyme technology in VY-AADC, Sanofi Genzyme is entitled to receive low-single-digit royalty payments based on a percentage of net sales by us, and we may be obligated to make certain regulatory milestone payments to a third-party licensor. 
 AbbVie Tau Collaboration
 In February 2018, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and option agreement with AbbVie for the research, development, and commercialization of AAV and other virus-based gene therapy products for the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system and other neurodegenerative diseases related to defective or excess aggregation of tau protein in the human brain, including Alzheimer’s disease. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $69.0 million and may receive future option fees, development and regulatory milestone payments and royalties. Under the terms of the agreement, we will perform specified research, preclinical, and Phase 1 development activities regarding vectorized antibodies directed against tau, after which AbbVie may select one or more vectorized antibodies to proceed into IND-enabling studies and clinical development. We will be responsible for the research, IND-enabling studies, and Phase 1 clinical trial activities and costs. Following the completion of Phase 1 clinical development, AbbVie has an option to license the vectorized tau antibody program and would then lead further clinical development and global commercialization for the product candidates pursuant to the agreement. We may earn up to $215.0 million in option exercise fees for such preclinical and Phase 1 development activities. In addition to the upfront payment and the potential option exercise payments, we are eligible to receive up to $895.0 million in development and regulatory milestones for each vectorized tau antibody compound. We are also eligible to receive tiered, escalating royalties in a range, subject to certain specified exceptions, from a high-single digit to a mid-to-high teen percentage of the global net sales of the vectorized antibodies for tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. We also have an option to share in the costs of clinical development for higher royalty rates. Under the terms of the agreement, each party will own the entire right, title and interest in and to all know-how and 

 
  7

 
patent rights first made or invented solely by it or its affiliates or its or their sublicensees in the course of the collaboration, with certain specified exceptions. We have also agreed to grant AbbVie a worldwide license to certain know-how and patent rights developed by us or jointly by the parties arising from the collaboration. 
 Neurocrine Collaboration
 In January 2019, we entered into the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the research, development and commercialization of four programs including our Parkinson’s disease program, or AADC Program, our Friedreich’s ataxia program, or FA Program, and two programs, or the Discovery Programs. The Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement is not yet effective and remains subject to customary closing conditions, including certain antitrust approvals, that have not been satisfied as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive an upfront payment of $165.0 million, inclusive of $50.0 million for the sale of 4,179,728 shares of our common stock, and may receive future development and regulatory milestone payments and royalties. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the products in each of these programs. Neurocrine will be responsible for all costs incurred by us in conducting these activities for each program, in accordance with an agreed budget. 
 Under the terms of the agreement for the AADC Program, Neurocrine will fund the clinical development of the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trials for VY-AADC. After the data readout of the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial, we have the option to either: (1) co-commercialize VY-AADC with Neurocrine in the U.S. under a 50/50 cost- and profit-sharing arrangement and receive milestones and royalties based on ex-U.S. sales, or (2) grant Neurocrine full global commercial rights in exchange for milestone payments and royalties based on global sales. Under the terms of the agreement for the FA Program, Neurocrine will fund the development through the Phase 1 clinical trial of VY-FXN01. After the data readout of the Phase 1 trial, we have the option to either: (1) co-commercialize VY-FXN01 with Neurocrine in the U.S. under a 60/40 cost- and profit-sharing arrangement, or (2) grant Neurocrine full worldwide commercial rights in exchange for milestone payments and royalties based on global sales, subject to Sanofi Genzyme’s option to commercialize the FA Program in countries outside the United States. Under the terms of the agreement for the two Discovery Programs, Neurocrine will fund the development of those programs and we have the right to earn milestone payments and royalties based on global sales.
 In addition to the upfront payment, we are eligible to receive aggregate development milestone payments under (i) the AADC Program of up to $170.0 million, (ii) the FA Program of up to $195.0 million, and (iii) each of the Discovery Programs of up to $130.0 million each. We may also be entitled to receive aggregate commercial milestone payments for each collaboration product of up to $275.0 million, subject to an aggregate cap on commercial milestone payments across all programs of $1.1 billion. We are also eligible to receive royalties, based on future net sales of the collaboration products. Such royalty percentages, for net sales in and outside the United States, as applicable, range (i) for the AADC Program, from the mid-teens to thirty and the low-teens to twenty, respectively; (ii) for the FA Program, from the low-teens to high-teens and high-single digits to mid-teens, respectively; and (iii) for each Discovery Program, from the high-single digits to mid-teens and mid-single digits to low-teens, respectively. 
 AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration
 In February 2019, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and option agreement with AbbVie for the development and commercialization of vectorized antibodies directed against pathological species of alpha-synuclein for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other diseases characterized by the abnormal accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein, or synucleinopathies. Under the terms of this agreement, we will receive and upfront payment of $65.0 million and may receive future option fees, development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, and royalties. Under the terms of the agreement, we and AbbVie have agreed to collaborate on the research and development of specified vectorized antibody compounds, or research compounds, comprised of an AAV or other viral capsid and a virus vector genome that encodes one or more antibodies that target and bind to the alpha-synuclein protein. The collaboration is comprised of a research period and a development period. We are obligated to conduct research activities directed to constructing one or more virus vectors that encode antibodies designated by AbbVie. We are obligated to use diligent efforts to conduct antibody engineering and other research activities to create the Research Compounds and to develop product candidates containing or comprised of such Research Compounds, which we refer to as Product Candidates. We are solely responsible for the costs and expenses during the research period. During a 

 
  8

 
specified portion of the Research Period, AbbVie may exercise one or more of its exclusive development options to select up to a total of four Research Compounds and their corresponding Product Candidates to proceed to the development period, after which AbbVie may exercise its option to license such Product Candidates following Phase 1 results, for which we may earn up to $245.0 million in option exercise payments in aggregate. In addition to the upfront payment and the potential option exercise payments, we are eligible to receive up to $727.5 million in development and regulatory milestones for each Licensed Compound. We are also eligible to receive tiered, escalating royalties, in the mid-single-digit percentage range on aggregate net sales of Licensed Products on a Licensed Compound by Licensed Compound basis, as well as up to $500.0 million in commercial milestones based on aggregate annual net sales thresholds of Licensed Products. The royalties are subject to potential reductions for biosimilar market penetration, patent claim expiration, and other provisions, subject to specified limits. Subject to certain exceptions, each of AbbVie and the Company has agreed to be financially responsible for all payments owed to a third party with which it has contracted for any use of in-licensed intellectual property under the Collaboration Agreement.
 Mission and Strategy
 Our mission is to become the world leader in AAV gene therapy focused on treating severe neurological diseases by developing transformative therapies. Our strategy to achieve this mission is to: 
· | Optimize and advance VY-AADC for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. We continue to evaluate the dosing and delivery of VY-AADC to determine the optimal and safe dose to achieve meaningful clinical benefit for patients with Parkinson’s disease. The November 2018 interim results from the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial include data from all 15 patients treated in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 (five patients in each Cohort) including data from patients in Cohort 1 at three years, Cohort 2 at two years and Cohort 3 at 18 months. The results continue to demonstrate durable improvements across multiple measures of patients’ motor function after a one-time administration of the gene therapy, as evidenced by the patients’ diaries, the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, or UPDRS, UPDRS-II and UPDRS-III, and quality of life assessments. The average measure of motor function by UPDRS, or UPDRS-III, on medication score was 13.5 and UPDRS-III off medication score was 37.1, the average measure of activities of daily living by UPDRS, or UPDRS-II. The update of results from the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial of VY-AADC include a 2.1-hour mean improvement in good ON time from baseline to three years for patients in Cohort 1, a 2.7-hour mean improvement from baseline to 2 years in Cohort 2, and a mean improvement of 1.7 hours from baseline to eighteen months in Cohort 3.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial, we have selected a dose of up to 2.5 x 1012 vector genomes, which is defined as a maximum total bilateral dose. This dose is between the up-to-maximum total vector genome doses administered in Cohorts 2 and 3 from the Phase 1b trial when considering the higher volume administered with the posterior trajectory and vector produced using the baculovirus system. Having selected a dose for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial between the two highest dose Cohorts from the Phase 1b trial, we have performed a combined analysis of the outcomes from the ten patients in Cohorts 2 and 3. Results from the combined ten patients in Cohorts 2 and 3 demonstrated mean increases from baseline in good ON time of 2.4 hours per day at 12 months, the timepoint for the primary endpoint in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial, and 2.6 hours per day at 18 months, the latest timepoint measured for both Cohorts. Of the combined ten patients in Cohorts 2 and 3, seven patients would have met the eligibility criteria for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial based on limits in severity of dyskinesia and minimum OFF time at baseline. For these seven patients, the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial relevant group, the mean improvements in good ON time were 2.8 hours at 12 months and 2.5 hours at 18 months. These results were achieved with clinically meaningful and sustained reductions in daily oral levodopa and related medications. In December 2018, we randomized the first patient in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. 

· | Build and advance a pipeline of gene therapy programs focused on severe neurological diseases. Beyond our clinical-stage program for Parkinson’s disease, we have a deep pipeline of AAV gene therapy programs in various stages of preclinical development. We plan to file two additional INDs for our preclinical

programs in 2019. We believe that our leadership position in AAV gene therapy for severe neurological diseases and our gene therapy platform provide us with the necessary capabilities to evaluate and capitalize on external opportunities. As such, we plan to opportunistically expand our pipeline through acquisition, in-licensing or other strategic transactions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continuously invest in our AAV gene therapy platform. We plan to continuously invest in our gene therapy platform to maintain our leadership in AAV gene therapy for neurological diseases. Specifically, we intend to further develop and enhance our gene therapy platform by focusing on (i) vector engineering and optimization; (ii) manufacturing; and (iii) dosing and delivery techniques. We plan to continue generating novel AAV vectors by engineering and optimizing vectors best suited to a targeted disease. We have built an onsite, state-of-the-art process research and development facility to enable the manufacturing of high quality AAV gene therapy vectors at laboratory scale. We expect to utilize established and novel techniques for dosing and delivery of our AAV gene therapies to the central nervous system, or CNS.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Establish a leadership position in commercial-scale, high quality AAV manufacturing. We believe that manufacturing capacity and expertise are critical to successfully treating patients using gene therapy. We have established relationships with multiple current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, contract manufacturers. Previously, through one of our collaborations, with MassBiologics, an FDA-licensed manufacturer affiliated with the University of Massachusetts Medical School, we initiated cGMP production activities. More recently, we announced additional agreements with Brammer Bio and with Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies, established contract manufacturers that specialize in gene therapy and AAV vectors. We are using the baculovirus/Sf9 AAV production system, a technology for producing AAV vectors at scale in insect-derived cells, originally invented and developed by several current and former members of our production team while at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, which we continue to improve upon. We believe that having oversight through these key relationships over our own commercial manufacturing process is critical to ensuring quality product with commercial yields.

· | Retain commercialization rights to our programs. We hold worldwide rights for our ALS, and severe, chronic pain programs. We have retained co-development and co-commercialization rights for our Parkinson’s disease and Friedreich’s ataxia programs under our Neurocrine Collaboration and for our Huntington’s disease program under our Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration, respectively. As these and other programs advance through late-stage clinical development, we intend to build our own sales and marketing infrastructure and leverage our partnerships to support our programs where we have retained commercialization rights. These collaborations also represent an important advance in our strategy to leverage our AAV gene therapy platform and programs through collaborative partnerships with biopharmaceutical companies that bring complementary expertise, capabilities, and experience, in addition to capital.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand our intellectual property portfolio. We seek to have an industry leading intellectual property portfolio. To that end, we seek patent rights for various aspects of our programs, including vector engineering and construct design, our production process, and all features of our clinical products including compositions and methods of delivery. We expect to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by aggressively seeking patent rights for promising aspects of our gene therapy platform and product candidates.

  AAV Gene Therapy for Neurological Diseases 
 Gene therapy is an approach whereby gene expression is directly altered in patients to address the underlying cause or predominant manifestations of disease. We believe that the targeted nature of gene therapy may enable powerful treatment options and provide these patients with meaningful and durable benefits. 

 
  10

 

 While AAV gene therapy can potentially be harnessed for multiple treatment methods, we are currently focused on gene replacement and gene knockdown approaches. Gene replacement is intended to restore the expression of a protein that is not expressed, expressed at abnormally low levels or functionally mutated with loss of function. Gene knockdown, or gene silencing, is intended to reduce the expression of a pathologically mutated protein that has detrimental effects. 

Our gene therapy approach uses AAV vectors which we believe are ideal vectors for gene therapy for several reasons: 
 Broad Applicability. AAV is able to transduce, or transfer a therapeutic gene, into numerous cell types including target cells in the CNS. 
 Safety. AAV is believed to be safe and is not known to cause any disease in humans. No vector-related serious adverse effects, or SAEs, have been reported in the more than 1,500 patients, including over 200 patients for neurological indications, treated with AAV gene therapy to date. 
 Does Not Readily Integrate. AAV does not readily integrate into the genome of the target cell, reducing the potential for oncogenesis, or the induction of cancer.
 Scalability. AAV is able to be manufactured at commercial quality and scale. 
 We believe that neurological diseases are well-suited for treatment with AAV gene therapy for the following reasons: 
 Validated Targets. Many neurological diseases are caused by well-defined mutations in genes and these genes represent genetically validated drug targets for AAV gene therapy. 
 Targeted Delivery. Advances in delivery techniques allow for direct delivery of AAV vectors to discrete regions in the brain or broader delivery throughout the spinal cord via the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. 
     Durable Expression. Long-term gene expression may be achievable in the CNS following one-time dosing and transfer of the therapeutic gene with an AAV vector. Neurons in the CNS are terminally differentiated, or no longer divide, eliminating the potential for cell division to dilute expression of the therapeutic gene. Repeated or continual dosing with direct injection of drugs into the CNS is complex, therefore a one-time AAV gene therapy has significant advantages. 
 Immune Privileged Site. There is a reduced risk of harmful immune response or reduced efficacy due to localized delivery in a self-contained system. 
 While we are currently focused on gene replacement and gene knockdown approaches, we are also actively exploring additional potential treatment methods that can utilize an AAV vector, including the direct delivery of monoclonal antibodies to the CNS (such as in our collaborations with AbbVie), as well as gene editing to correct or delete a gene in the cell genome. 
 The Voyager Gene Therapy Platform 
 We have built a gene therapy platform that we believe positions us to be the leading company at the intersection of AAV gene therapy and severe neurological diseases. Our team of experts in the fields of AAV gene therapy and neuroscience first identifies and selects severe neurological diseases that are well-suited for treatment using AAV gene therapy. We then engineer and optimize AAV vectors for delivery of the virus payload to the targeted tissue or cells. Finally, we leverage established routes of administration and advances in dosing techniques to optimize delivery of our AAV gene therapies to target cells that are critical to the disease of interest either directly to discrete regions of the brain, 

 
  11

 
or, more broadly, to the spinal cord region. We believe that optimizing each of these parameters is a key factor for overall program success. We expect that our current and future pipeline programs will make use of technological advances generated with our gene therapy platform. 
 Disease Selection 
 We assess potential product programs based upon the following criteria: 
 Unmet Need. There is a significant unmet medical need for the indication and substantial commercial potential. 
 Target Validation. There is strong evidence that expression of a specific gene, or lack thereof, is causing, or critical to, the disease state. 
 Delivery Using AAV. There is strong evidence supporting the ability to target the relevant tissue and cells using an AAV vector to achieve sufficient target gene expression. 
 Clinical Readouts. The clinical impact of an AAV gene therapy can be clearly measured, including through well-accepted clinical endpoints and the use of both existing and novel biomarkers. 
 Scalability of Manufacturing. Sufficient AAV vector to supply late-stage clinical development and commercialization can be manufactured. 
 In addition to the criteria above, we also look for groups of diseases where our knowledge can be transferred. For instance, we believe that some of the delivery parameters and imaging techniques that are employed in our VY-AADC program can be applied to AAV gene therapy delivery for Huntington’s disease or other diseases where direct, targeted delivery to the brain is warranted. 
 Vector Engineering and Optimization 
 We have advanced or intend to advance our multiple preclinical programs towards selection of lead clinical candidates using AAV vectors that we believe are best suited for each of our programs either through use of our existing capsids, through exercising a non-exclusive worldwide commercial license to capsid sequences covered by third parties, or by engineering or optimizing novel capsids. The key components of an AAV vector include: (i) the capsid; (ii) the therapeutic gene, or transgene; and (iii) the promoter, or the DNA sequence that drives the expression of the transgene. 
 Members of our team have co-discovered many of the known naturally occurring AAV capsids and have also created promising genetically engineered AAV capsids. Genetically engineered capsids have yielded vectors with desirable properties, such as higher biological potency and enhanced tissue specificity. We believe that there is an opportunity to further optimize AAV capsids to confer desired characteristics relating to properties such as tissue specificity and immunogenicity. We have a significant effort dedicated to designing and screening for novel AAV capsids using a number of different scientific approaches. We believe that the information generated by this work will enhance our ability to rationally design AAV capsids with specific properties for particular therapeutic applications. In September 2016, we announced a co-exclusive worldwide license agreement with the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech, related to novel AAV capsids. The license agreement covers all fields of use and includes novel AAV capsids that have demonstrated enhanced blood-brain barrier penetration for the potential treatment of neurological diseases following systemic administration of an AAV gene therapy vector. 

With respect to the target DNA delivered through AAV gene therapy, we are selecting promoters that we believe have the appropriate activity and tissue, selectively for our specific gene therapy programs. We are also designing transgenes to provide optimal expression once delivered to the targeted cells.

 The ability to produce high quality AAV vectors at commercial-scale is a critical success factor in AAV gene therapy. While at the NIH, former members of our production team invented and developed a baculovirus/Sf9 AAV production system, which we use and have continued to improve. This system has a number of attributes that we believe will enable high quality commercial-scale manufacturing, including: 
 High Yield. A single manufacturing run at 500-liter scale can yield many thousands of doses of an AAV gene therapy. 
 High Purity. A relatively high percentage of AAV vectors contain the therapeutic DNA, reducing the number of empty capsids compared to alternative manufacturing approaches. In addition, the baculovirus/Sf9 system eliminates the risk of introducing mammalian cell derived impurities. 
 Scalability. This process has been reproduced at volumes ranging from 0.02 liters to 250 liters. We believe the existing process is scalable to substantially higher volumes. 
 We have built a state-of-the-art process research and development production facility for manufacturing research-grade AAV vectors onsite at our Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters. We have also established multiple contract manufacturing relationships with companies specializing in the manufacture of gene therapy and AAV vectors.
 Optimized Delivery and Route of Administration 
 Identifying the optimal route of administration and delivery parameters for AAV gene therapy, such as infusion volume, flow rate, vector concentration and dose and formulation for a specific disease, are critical to achieving safe and effective levels of transgene expression in the targeted location in the CNS. We aim to develop clinically feasible protocols that yield reproducible results across patients. For our Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease programs, we are pursuing direct injection into the brain, called intraparenchymal injection. For our ALS SOD1 and Friedreich’s ataxia programs, we are evaluating multiple routes of administration including injection into the CSF within the cerebrospinal space, called intrathecal injection, as well as intravenous injection, intraparenchymal injection, and other delivery alternatives.

VTAGTM Intraparenchymal Injection to the Brain    The surgical approach that we are using for VY-AADC is similar, in some respects, to the stereotactic approach used for deep brain stimulation, or DBS, a marketed device-based treatment for Parkinson’s disease. One primary difference with our approach is the ability to assist the physician in visualizing the delivery of VY-AADC to the putamen using real-time, intra-operative, magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, to avoid specific blood vessels to reduce the risk of potential hemorrhages during the surgical procedure and to maximize the coverage of the putamen. 
 Investigators in the Phase 1b clinical trial of VY-AADC and the separate Phase 1 posterior trajectory trial use the real-time, intra-operative, MRI system called the ClearPoint System® from MRI Interventions, Inc. However, not all neuro-surgical units within the United States utilize this system and may employ other neuro-navigational systems that are not compatible with real-time MRI imaging. 
 Consequently, we developed the Voyager Trajectory Array Guide, or V-TAG™, as our own device for use as a real-time, intra-operative, MRI-compatible device that can be used with other neuro-navigational systems for this and other surgical procedures. We received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in July 2018. We are currently working with a collaborator on process development and manufacturing of the device. We believe that our experience gained from our VY-AADC program, including the use of V-TAG, can be applied to AAV gene therapy delivery for our Huntington’s disease program and possibly other projects as well.

 Overview of Our Pipeline 
 We have leveraged our gene therapy platform to assemble a pipeline of novel AAV gene therapies for the treatment of severe neurological diseases with high unmet medical need. Depending on the disease, our current AAV gene therapies will use either a gene replacement or gene knockdown approach. Our goal is to address the underlying cause or the predominant manifestations of a specific disease by significantly increasing or decreasing expression of the relevant proteins at targeted sites within the CNS.  Parkinson’s Disease Program: VY-AADC
 Disease and VY-AADC Overview 
 Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disease that affects approximately 1 million people in the United States and 6 million people worldwide. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine and its function. Dopamine is a chemical “messenger” that is produced in the brain and is involved in the control of movement. Some chemicals, like dopamine, are made from other chemicals by proteins called enzymes. Dopamine is made in the brain when the enzyme AADC (aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase) converts the chemical levodopa to dopamine. Levodopa, AADC, and dopamine are each present at normal levels in healthy people.
 When dopamine levels decrease in the brain and there is no longer enough to control movement, the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease including tremors, slow movement or loss of movement, rigidity, and postural instability, may occur. When this happens, a doctor may prescribe a levodopa medication, which is converted into dopamine by AADC in substantially the same way that naturally occurring levodopa is converted to dopamine.
 As Parkinson’s disease worsens, there is less AADC enzyme in parts of the brain where it is needed to convert levodopa to dopamine. Therefore, the amount of dopamine that is produced from each dose of levodopa medicine may be reduced. When this happens, patients’ motor function may worsen and a less predictable response to medications may occur.
 Our investigational gene therapy VY-AADC is designed to put the AADC enzyme into brain cells where it can convert levodopa to dopamine. To do this, the AADC gene is delivered inside a transporter called “adeno-associated

viral vector,” which we refer to as AAV, much like a letter that carries the instructions the brain needs to make the AADC enzyme with the AAV as the envelope that carries the letter.
 Preclinical Studies 
 Preclinical studies conducted by Krystof Bankiewicz, M.D., Ph.D., one of our co-founders, and his colleagues at the University of California San Francisco, or UCSF, evaluated the safety, efficacy and pharmacological activity of AAV2-AADC gene therapy, a gene therapy substantially similar to VY-AADC, delivered directly to the putamen in a non-human primate model of Parkinson’s disease. Overall, the procedure and vector were well-tolerated with no serious toxicity issues. 
 Positron emission tomography, or PET, imaging with tracers specific for AADC enzyme activity demonstrated a significant and sustained increase of activity in the brain region where the vector had been delivered. Increased responsiveness to levodopa was also evidenced by significant behavioral improvements observed post-treatment with the gene therapy compared to pre-treatment. In five animals, the mean improvement in behavior was determined at various doses of levodopa both one month before treatment, as a baseline measure for comparison purposes, and then again six months after treatment. A strong PET signal was observed in all five animals following treatment, confirming delivery of AADC into the putamen. Animals were significantly more sensitive to levodopa six months following treatment with the gene therapy when compared to baseline, as shown below.

 * A result is considered to be statistically significant when the probability of the result occurring by random chance, rather than from the efficacy of the treatment, is sufficiently low. The conventional method for measuring the statistical significance of a result is known as the “p‑value,” which represents the probability that chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value = 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% or less probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). 
 The results of these preclinical studies provided support for the initiation of clinical trials.

 Previous Phase 1 Clinical Trials
 The UPDRS is a standard and widely used four-part clinical rating scale for Parkinson’s disease that evaluates cognitive, functional, and motor deficits, as well as medication-related complications. UPDRS Part III measures motor function by physician examination. The UPDRS is conducted when patients are taking their Parkinson’s disease medications (referred to as “on” medication) and when patients are not taking their Parkinson’s disease medications (referred to as “off” medication). In addition, a patient-completed Hauser diary records the patient’s motor response over the course of several days as ON time when they have good mobility with or without non-troublesome dyskinesia, or uncontrolled, involuntary movement; OFF time when they have poor mobility; and ON time with troublesome dyskinesia when they have uncontrolled movements. As shown in the figure below, diary ON time decreases, while OFF time and dyskinesias increase as patients progress from the early honeymoon period into later stages of Parkinson’s disease. 
 Overview of Progression of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) 

 In a completed open-label Phase 1 clinical trial conducted at UCSF, VY-AADC was delivered directly to the putamen of Parkinson’s disease patients. The primary endpoints of this trial were safety and tolerability of VY-AADC. These endpoints were met as VY-AADC was well-tolerated and no treatment related SAEs were reported. Furthermore, pharmacologic activity of VY-AADC was observed. This trial was completed prior to our involvement in the program. 
 The Phase 1 clinical trial at UCSF was conducted in a total of 10 patients with Parkinson’s disease. Two doses of VY-AADC were tested, 9×1010 vector genomes, or vg, and 3×1011 vg, with five patients per dose Cohort. The infusion volume was 100µl per putamen, or 200µl per patient. Patients in both Cohorts treated with VY-AADC showed modest improvements in motor fluctuations. At six months following treatment, diary OFF time was observed to be reduced by an average of approximately three hours and a corresponding increase in diary ON time without dyskinesias was also observed. In addition, at six months following treatment, an approximately 30% improvement in UPDRS total score both on-medication and off-medication UPDRS Total score, was observed, as shown in the table below.

 Summary of UPDRS Results from Phase 1 Trial(1)   
 (1) Christine et al, Neurology (2009), 73: 1662-1669. The row titled “Low-dose Cohort” represents data from the five patients treated with 9 X 1010 vg of VY-AADC01. The row titled “High-dose Cohort” represents data from the five patients treated with 3 X 1011 vg of VY-AADC01. The row titled “Combined Cohorts” represents data from all ten patients treated with VY-AADC01. The data in the columns under the header “Off medications” represents periods during which patients’ medications were not working as measured by a patient’s total UPDRS score at baseline, before treatment with VY-AADC01, and at six months following treatment with VY-AADC01, along with percent change from baseline to six months and the corresponding p-value. The data in the columns under the header “On medications” represents periods during which patients’ medications were working as measured by a patient’s total UPDRS score at baseline, before treatment with VY-AADC01 and at six months following treatment with VY-AADC01, along with percent change from baseline to six months and the corresponding p-value. A result is considered to be statistically significant when the probability of the result occurring by random chance, rather than from the efficacy of the treatment, is sufficiently low. The conventional method for measuring the statistical significance of a result is known as the “p‑value,” which represents the probability that chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value = 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% or less probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). Because of the small size of this trial, the p-values may not be reliable or repeatable, and may not be duplicated in future trials.
 While no gene therapy related SAEs were reported, three patients experienced minor hemorrhages related to the surgical procedure. Two of the hemorrhages were asymptomatic, noticed only on imaging, and one was symptomatic with the patient making an almost complete recovery. Nevertheless, the stereotactic injection protocol used in the surgical procedure was modified to avoid specific blood vessels and no further hemorrhages were reported. In our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial, we implemented the use of real-time, intra-operative MRI guidance. The use of this intra-operative MRI guidance is a significant advancement in vector delivery. 
 The 10 patients in this Phase 1 clinical trial were followed for up to four years after treatment, and a durable, dose-dependent expression of AADC enzyme activity was observed. Patients treated with both doses of the gene therapy had an increased PET signal, or uptake of the [18F]fluoro-L-m-tyrosine tracer indicative of AADC enzyme activity that persisted for up to four years. Patients treated with the high dose gene therapy had a greater PET signal on average when compared to the low dose Cohort.

 Long-Term AADC Expression as Measured by PET Imaging in Patients Treated with High and Low Doses of AAV Gene Therapy in a Previous Phase 1 Clinical Trial (1)

 A similar Phase 1 clinical trial was conducted at Jichi Medical University, or JMU, in Japan using the same vector that was used in the UCSF trial. The primary endpoint of this trial was safety of the treatment. This endpoint was met as the treatment was well-tolerated and no treatment related SAEs were reported. Six patients were treated in this trial and an enhanced PET signal was observed in a subset of patients monitored 96 weeks following treatment. A second, open-label Phase 1/2 trial is currently being conducted at JMU. The primary endpoint of this trial is also safety. This trial is using lower infusion volumes and total doses compared to our ongoing Phase 1b and Phase 2 clinical trials. Importantly, the JMU trial is not using real-time, intra-operative MRI guidance. 
 While the prior UCSF and JMU clinical results were encouraging and provided evidence of long-term AADC enzyme expression, the magnitude of the clinical benefits observed did not exceed placebo effects observed in previous surgical therapy trials in Parkinson’s disease patients, and the UCSF and JMU trials were not blinded. Further, based on post-operative imaging and our current work using real-time, intra-operative MRI monitoring, we estimate that less than 10% of the putamen volume was covered by the infusion in these trials, which reflects suboptimal distribution of the gene therapy vector in the putamen. We believe that by further optimizing the delivery, dose and infusion volume to substantially increase the coverage of the putamen, a more substantial clinical benefit can be achieved. 

Voyager VY-AADC Phase 1b Trial 
 In 2014, UCSF initiated an open-label Phase 1b clinical trial to optimize the development of VY-AADC. The IND for the Phase 1b trial was filed by UCSF in July 2013 and was transferred to us in October 2015. In November 2017, we completed enrolling this open-label, dose-escalating Phase 1b trial of VY-AADC. The trial included 15 patients with Parkinson’s disease and was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of escalating doses of VY-AADC. In this trial, one-time administration of VY-AADC led to improvements in patients’ motor function, and patients were able to reduce their daily levodopa and other Parkinson’s disease medications. To date, administration of VY-AADC has been well-tolerated. In patients treated in this trial, there have been no vector-related serious adverse events reported.

 Patients in three Cohorts of five patients each were treated with a single administration of ascending doses of VY-AADC administered under MRI guidance to the putamen, a region of the brain associated with impaired motor function in Parkinson’s disease. The primary endpoints of this trial are safety and tolerability of the treatment. This trial incorporates three key design features: 

· | Use of real-time, intra-operative MRI system during surgery to assist the physician in visualizing the delivery of VY-AADC to the putamen and to avoid specific blood vessels during the surgical procedure, with the goal of reducing the risk of hemorrhages.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Larger infusion volumes designed to increase coverage of the putamen with VY-AADC.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Higher concentrations of VY-AADC vector compared to the previously completed UCSF Phase 1 trial.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Secondary endpoints of this trial, which are being used to assess the potential pharmacologic activity of VY-AADC, include UPDRS, AADC PET imaging, quality of life, a patient-completed Hauser diary monitoring good ON time without troublesome dyskinesia, and a behavioral test using intravenous levodopa treatment to measure changes in a patients’ sensitivity to levodopa as well as endpoints to measure motor functions. 
 In November 2018, we updated interim results from the ongoing, open-label Phase 1b clinical trial of VY-AADC for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Interim results include data from all 15 patients treated in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 (five patients in each Cohort) including data from patients in Cohort 1 at three years, Cohort 2 at two years and Cohort 3 at 18 months. Cohort 1 patients received a single administration of VY-AADC at a concentration of 8.3×1011 vg per milliliter, or vg/ml, using an infusion volume of up to 450 µL per putamen, or up to 900 µL per patient, for a total dose of 7.5×1011 vg. Cohort 2 patients received a single administration of VY-AADC at a concentration of 8.3×1011 vg/ml, using an infusion volume of up to 900 µL per putamen, or up to 1,800 µL per patient, for a total dose of 1.5×1012 vg. Cohort 3 patients received a three-fold higher vg concentration of 2.6×1012 with the same infusion volumes of VY-AADC similar to those received by Cohort 2 patients (up to 900 µL per putamen), for a total dose of up to 4.5×1012 vg.
 Administration of VY-AADC has been well-tolerated in all fifteen patients treated in the three Cohorts with no reported vector-related SAEs. Fourteen of the 15 patients were discharged from the hospital within two days following surgery. As previously reported, one patient experienced two SAEs: a pulmonary embolism or blood clot in the lungs, and related heart arrhythmia or irregular heartbeat. Investigators determined that these SAEs were most likely related to immobility during the administration of the product; consequently, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis has been added to the clinical trial protocol.
 Key findings from this trial to date include:

· | The use of real-time, MRI-guided delivery and increasing infusion volumes resulted in progressively greater coverage of the putamen, 21% mean coverage of the volume of the putamen with VY-AADC in Cohort 1, 34% mean coverage in Cohort 2, and 42% mean coverage in Cohort 3.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | VY-AADC treatment resulted in a 13% increase, a 56% increase, and a 79% increase in mean putaminal AADC enzyme activity in Cohort 1, 2, and 3, respectively, at six months relative to baseline as measured by 18F-Dopa PET scan. Coverage of the putamen and AADC enzyme activity were highly correlated (r=0.84, p=0.0002).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | One-time administration of VY-AADC resulted in reduced daily doses of oral levodopa and related medications. Six months after VY-AADC administration, patients in Cohort 1 had a reduction in levodopa equivalent daily dose, or LED, of 15%, Cohort 2 had a LED reduction of 33%, and Cohort 3 had a LED reduction of 42%. LED reductions were maintained through last follow up in Cohort 2 (24 months) and Cohort 3 (18 months).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Patients enrolled in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 were:

 
  19

 


· On average, 58 years of age with a Parkinson’s disease diagnosis for an average of 10 years.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Candidates for surgical intervention including deep-brain stimulation due to disabling motor complications despite treatment with optimal anti-Parkinsonian medication.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | At baseline, the average patient diary ON time without troublesome dyskinesia was 10.5 hours and, average diary OFF time was 4.6 hours; both diary measures were normalized to a 16-hour waking day.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Average UPDRS-III (motor function) on medication score was 13.5 and UPDRS-III off-medication score was 37.1; average UPDRS-II (activities of daily living) on medication score was 3.9 and UPDRS-II off medication score was 16.5. Patients in Cohort 3 entered the trial with more severe dyskinesia at baseline than patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 based on the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale, with a mean score of 30.2 for Cohort 3 compared with a mean score of 19.2 and 17.4 for Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | At baseline, patients were treated with optimal levels of multiple dopaminergic medications including, in many cases, amantadine for the treatment of dyskinesia, or uncontrolled or involuntary movements. Patients’ average amount of Parkinson’s disease medications at baseline was 1,526 mg of oral LEDs per day.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The results continue to demonstrate durable improvements across multiple measures of patients’ motor function after a one-time administration of the gene therapy, as evidenced by the patients’ diaries and UPDRS-III, and quality of life assessments. The update of results from the ongoing Phase 1b trial of VY-AADC include a 2.1-hour mean improvement in good ON time from baseline to three years for patients in Cohort 1, a 2.7-hour mean improvement from baseline to two years in Cohort 2, and a mean improvement of 1.7 hours from baseline to 18 months in Cohort 3 as shown in the table below.

 For the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial, we have selected a dose of up to 2.5 x 1012 vg, which is defined as a maximum total bilateral dose. This dose is between the up-to-maximum total vector genome doses administered in Cohorts 2 and 3 from the Phase 1b trial when considering the higher volume administered with the posterior trajectory and vector produced using the baculovirus system. Having selected a dose for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial between the two highest dose Cohorts from the Phase 1b trial, we have performed a combined analysis of the outcomes from ten patients in Cohorts 2 and 3. Results from the combined ten patients in Cohorts 2 and 3 demonstrated mean increases from baseline in good ON time of 2.4 hours per day at 12 months, the timepoint for the primary endpoint in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial, and 2.6 hours per day at 18 months, the latest timepoint measured for both Cohorts as shown in the table below. Of the combined ten patients in Cohorts 2 and 3, seven patients would have met the eligibility criteria for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial based on limits in severity of dyskinesia and minimum OFF time at baseline. For these seven patients, the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial relevant group, the mean improvements in good ON time were 2.8 hours at 12 months and 2.5 hours at 18 months. These results were achieved with clinically meaningful and sustained reductions in daily oral levodopa and related medications.

 Voyager Phase 1 Posterior Trajectory Clinical Trial
 In a separate Phase 1 clinical trial, we have changed the trajectory for administration of VY-AADC to a posterior, or back of the head, approach into the putamen, compared to a transfrontal, or top of the head, delivery approach used in Cohorts 1 through 3 of the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial described above. A posterior approach better aligns the infusion of VY-AADC with the anatomical structure of the putamen, which reduces the number of trajectories needed and potentially reduces the total procedure time and increases the total coverage of the putamen. Administration of VY-AADC with this posterior approach has been well-tolerated in the eight patients treated with no reported SAEs. Most patients were discharged from the hospital the day after surgery. This trial utilized the same dose concentration as Cohort 3 of our Phase 1b clinical trial at a higher volume, yielding a total dose of up to 9.0×1012 vg compared with a total dose of up to 4.5×1012 vg in Cohort 3. As we announced in July 2018, interim results suggest that the posterior approach is associated with greater average putaminal coverage (approximately 50%), reduced total procedure times compared with the transfrontal approach by two to three hours, and improvements in patients’ motor function at six months, which were consistent with improvements achieved from patients in Cohorts 2 and 3 at the same time point in our Phase 1b trial with VY-AADC. We have determined that the posterior approach is the preferred surgical route of administration for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial.
 We continue to follow patients from Cohorts 1 through 3 in the Phase 1b clinical trial of VY-AADC and patients in the Phase 1 posterior trajectory trial, and plan to report updated results from these trials from time to time.
 Voyager VY-AADC RESTORE-1 Phase 2 and RESTORE-2 Phase 3 Clinical Trials 
 In December 2017, we submitted an IND for VY-AADC which has become effective. As part of this IND, the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls section included data demonstrating comparability between VY-AADC using our baculovirus/Sf9 manufacturing process and VY-AADC produced using a mammalian cell system consisting of triple-transfection of HEK293 cells, which was used in our two Phase 1 clinical trials. Both were produced under good manufacturing practice or GMP. Our baculovirus/Sf9 manufacturing process is designed for production of AAV vectors at clinical and commercial scale, with the potential for increased yields and efficient scalability compared with mammalian-based systems. We have demonstrated that this production platform change resulted in comparable vector quality and activity. We are using VY-AADC manufactured in our baculovirus/Sf9 system in our global RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial and the planned RESTORE-2 Phase 3 clinical trial. In June 2018, the FDA granted RMAT designation for our VY-AADC gene therapy treatment, which provides for an enhanced level of interactions between the company sponsor and the FDA throughout the development program. The designation was based on our Phase 1b clinical data with VY-AADC. Previously, the FDA also granted fast-track designation for VY-AADC. 
 In December 2018, we announced randomization of the first patient in RESTORE-1 Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-surgery controlled trial evaluating the safety and our efficacy of VY-AADC for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease in patients with motor fluctuations that are refractory to medical management. The RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial will enroll patients who have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease for at least four years, are not responding adequately to oral medications, and have at least three or more hours of OFF time during the day as measured by a validated self-reported patient diary. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized (1:1) to one-time 

 
  21

 
administration of VY-AADC (for a total dose of up to 2.5×1012 vg) or placebo surgery. In December 2018, we randomized the first patient in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. 
 The primary endpoint of RESTORE-1 is good ON time, as measured by a validated self-reported patient diary at 12 months. Secondary endpoints include diary OFF time, other motor function UPDRS-II and UPDRS-III scores, assessments from the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), and patient’s global function as measured by the proportion of participants with improvement on the Clinical Global Impression, or CGI, score. The trial will also measure non-motor symptoms from the Non-Motor Symptom Scale, or NMSS, as well as safety. 
 Biomarker data include measurements of the coverage of the putamen, the specific region of the brain targeted with VY-AADC, and measurements of AADC enzyme expression and activity in the putamen measured by PET using fluorodopa F-18. Changes in patients’ daily doses of oral levodopa and related medications will also be recorded.
 In December 2018, we held a Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss the overall development program for VY-AADC. Based on the meeting discussion and subsequent written feedback from the FDA, we plan to submit a revised trial protocol that will include an increase in the target number of patients in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial, resulting in 75 to 100 total patients in the trial, and to conduct a staggered-parallel RESTORE-2 Phase 3 trial of similar size and design to RESTORE-1. These updates incorporate guidance from the FDA from the Type B meeting to conduct two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials for a large patient population such as Parkinson’s disease.
 We expect that the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial will enroll 75 to 100 patients. Movement disorder specialists will identify and screen potential patients prior to referring to a surgical site for VY-AADC administration and provide clinical and safety follow-up after VY-AADC administration. 
 We expect patient enrollment to take 15 to 21 months from first patient enrolled, for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. We plan to begin enrolling the RESTORE-2 Phase 3 clinical trial in the first half of 2020. We anticipate that, if positive, results from the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial and the planned RESTORE-2 Phase 3 clinical trial could potentially form the basis for submission of a BLA, to the FDA for VY-AADC for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
 In January 2019, we entered into the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the research, development, and commercialization of four programs including our Parkinson’s disease program. 
 ALS Program: VY-SOD102
 Disease Overview 
 ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that leads to muscle atrophy, spasticity and weakness as well as impaired speech, swallowing and breathing, with many patients requiring ventilator support as the disease progresses. The average age of onset of ALS is 55 years, and median survival is approximately three years after initial symptoms appear. It is estimated that there are approximately 20,000 patients in the United States who are living with the disease. Familial, or inherited, ALS accounts for approximately 10% of ALS cases, and an estimated 20% of familial ALS is caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1, or SOD1, gene. Therefore, there are an estimated 400-800 patients in the United States with ALS caused by mutations in the SOD1 gene. 
 The normal function of the SOD1 protein is to catalyze the conversion of superoxide anion (O2-) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxygen (O2). Mutations in SOD1 have been shown to lead to the formation of toxic aggregates of the SOD1 protein, resulting in the dysfunction and death of motor neurons. Patients with familial ALS caused by certain mutations in the SOD1 gene progress more rapidly than patients with other forms of ALS, although the reason for this more rapid progression is unknown. 

 
  22

 

 There are currently only two FDA-approved treatments for ALS, Riluzole by Sanofi, which has been shown to have only modest efficacy, prolonging life by a few months, and Edaravone, which has been shown to slow decline of daily functioning. 
 Our Treatment Approach 
 We believe that AAV gene therapy is an attractive approach to treating monogenic ALS caused by SOD1 mutations. Since the SOD1 gene mutations that cause ALS are toxic gain-of-function mutations, we believe that we can employ an AAV gene therapy approach that targets the knockdown of SOD1 gene expression. In addition, the primary target cells - motor neurons - reside within the spinal cord, which we believe can be effectively transduced with AAV gene therapy through intraparenchymal injection as well as other routes of administration. The mechanism of action of VY-SOD102 is knockdown of SOD1 expression in motor neurons, thereby potentially reducing the level of toxicity associated with mutated protein, and slowing functional decline and prolonging ventilator-independent survival. 
 We believe that there is also the potential to leverage our approach for the treatment of other genetically defined forms of ALS. 
 Preclinical Studies Targeting SOD1 for Monogenic ALS 
 Results from our preclinical studies using intraparenchymal delivery of AAV vector to the spinal cord support targeting mutant SOD1 for the treatment of monogenic ALS. In the mini-pig, used as an animal model as it has a spinal cord similar in size to the human spinal cord, significant knockdown of SOD1 expression was observed following intraparenchymal spinal cord injection of an AAV vector carrying a transgene designed to inhibit SOD1 expression. This novel delivery approach with VY-SOD102 reduced SOD1 mRNA in the spinal cord on average by 70% and 50% in the cervical and thoracic regions, respectively, both regions critical for respiratory function, and 82% near the site of cervical injection. In addition, VY-SOD102 reduced SOD1 mRNA by 22% in the lumbar region. 
 The knockdown of SOD1 has also been reported to provide significant survival benefits in animal models of ALS. As shown in the example below, mice with a SOD1 mutation treated with an AAV vector to knock down expression of the mutant human SOD1 gene extended median survival by 87 days compared to mice treated with a control vector.

 These studies provide proof-of-principle for our approach to treating monogenic ALS due to SOD1 mutations with VY-SOD102. 
 Our Program Status 
 In late 2016, we identified VY-SOD101 as a lead clinical candidate after screening a series of capsids, microRNA expression cassettes, (a segment of DNA that contains the sequence that targets SOD1 gene expression selectively for knockdown), and encoded payloads. We screened more than 100 RNAi sequences, each represented by a bar in the graph below, and successfully identified multiple, highly-potent RNAi sequences targeting SOD1, as highlighted by the yellow bars in the figure below: 
 Overview of miRNA Target Sequences for Knockdown of SOD1

 The most potent RNAi sequences targeting SOD1 gene expression were evaluated in multiple microRNA expression cassettes and with a number of vector genome configurations. We have completed the necessary experiments to evaluate these potential lead candidates based upon criteria that include safety, selectivity, potency, and efficiency and precision of microRNA processing. 
 In late 2017, we initiated additional preclinical studies to further optimize our ALS program’s therapeutic approach, including exploration of additional routes of administration and novel AAV capsids in large animal models. Based on these studies, we selected VY-SOD102 as our lead candidate. VY-SOD102, our clinical candidate for the treatment of a monogenic form of ALS, is composed of an adeno-associated virus capsid and a proprietary transgene to selectively knock down levels of SOD1 mRNA. VY-SOD102 has the potential to durably reduce the levels of toxic mutant SOD1 protein in the spinal cord to slow the progression of disease. In late 2018 we presented data on VY-SOD102 administered with a novel delivery paradigm comprising a one-time, intraparenchymal infusion after laminectomy to the cervical spinal cord of the mini-pig, which has a spinal cord similar in length and diameter to the human spinal cord. This delivery approach yielded safe and significant reduction of SOD1 at four weeks post-dosing at the site of the infusion in the spinal cord, most notably in the cervical and thoracic regions critical for respiratory function. Further preclinical studies are underway with VY-SOD102 which, if successful, will support a potential filing of an IND application in 2019. 
 Friedreich’s ataxia Program: VY-FXN01
 Disease Overview 
 Friedreich’s ataxia is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease resulting in poor coordination of legs and arms, progressive loss of the ability to walk, generalized weakness, loss of sensation, scoliosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy as well as impaired vision, hearing and speech. The typical age of onset is 10 to 12 years, and life expectancy is severely reduced with patients generally dying of neurological and cardiac complications between the ages of 35 and 45. 

 
  24

 
According to the Friedreich’s Ataxia Research Alliance, there are approximately 6,400 patients living with the disease in the United States. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for the disease. 
 Friedreich’s ataxia patients have mutations of the FXN gene that reduce production of the frataxin protein, resulting in the degeneration of sensory pathways and a variety of debilitating symptoms. Friedreich’s ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a person must obtain a defective copy of the FXN gene from both parents in order to develop the condition. One healthy copy of the FXN gene, or 50% of normal frataxin protein levels, is sufficient to prevent the disease phenotype. We therefore believe that restoring FXN protein levels to at least 50% of normal levels by AAV gene therapy might lead to a successful therapy. 
 Our Treatment Approach 
 We are developing an AAV gene therapy approach that we believe will deliver a functional version of the FXN gene to the sensory pathways through intravenous injection. We think this approach has the potential to improve balance, ability to walk, sensory capability, coordination, strength and functional capacity of Friedreich’s ataxia patients. Most Friedreich’s ataxia patients produce low levels of the frataxin protein, which although insufficient to prevent the disease, exposes the patient’s immune system to frataxin. This reduces the likelihood that the FXN protein expressed by AAV gene therapy will trigger a harmful immune response.  Preclinical Studies 
 We initially conducted preclinical studies in non-human primates and achieved high FXN expression levels within the target sensory ganglia, or clusters of neurons, along the spinal region following intrathecal injection. More recently, we conducted preclinical studies in non-human primates with intravenous injection and achieved target FXN expression levels within sensory ganglia and the heart. The levels of FXN expression observed using an AAV vector were, on average, greater than FXN levels present in control normal human brain tissue. FXN expression was also observed in the cerebellar dentate nucleus, another area of the CNS that is often affected in Friedreich’s ataxia, and that is often considered difficult to target therapeutically.  Our Program Status 
 VY-FXN01 is currently in preclinical development. We are in the process of identifying a lead candidate which will comprise an optimal capsid, promoter, and FXN transgene. We are completing several AAV capsid screening experiments to identify capsids that effectively distribute to disease target tissues in a desired manner following intravenous injection. Criteria for evaluating these capsids include safety, overall level of transgene expression achieved, distribution of transgene expression and the specific cell types transduced. In addition, we are optimizing the promoter for VY-FXN01. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of our vectors, we have conducted testing in a new genetic mouse model of Friedreich’s ataxia. In this preclinical model of Friedreich’s ataxia, our gene therapy candidates durably improved sensory function, and rescued the Friedreich’s ataxia phenotype based on multiple functional tests. In physiological and behavioral assays, our gene therapy candidates demonstrated dose-dependent and durable responses for more than 10 months after a single administration, preventing central and peripheral disease progression. We also have a significant effort focused on better understanding the clinical course of Friedreich’s ataxia and identifying potential clinical endpoints for future clinical trials. 
 Once we identify a lead candidate for this program, we plan to complete IND enabling studies to evaluate its safety and efficacy. 
 In January 2019, we entered into the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the research, development, and commercialization of four programs including our Friedreich’s ataxia program.
 Huntington’s Disease Program: VY-HTT01

 
  25

 

 Disease Overview 
 Huntington’s disease is a fatal, inherited neurodegenerative disease that results in the progressive decline of motor and cognitive functions and a range of behavioral and psychiatric disturbances. The average age of onset is 39 years, with patients typically dying approximately 15 to 20 years following diagnosis. According to the Huntington’s Disease Society of America, Huntington’s disease affects approximately 30,000 patients in the United States. Huntington’s disease is caused by mutations in the huntingtin, or HTT, gene. Huntington’s disease is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that an individual is at risk of inheriting the disease if only one parent is affected. More than 200,000 individuals in the United States are at risk for inheriting the mutant gene from an affected parent. While the exact function of the HTT gene in healthy individuals is unknown, it is essential for normal development before birth and mutations in the HTT gene ultimately lead to the production of abnormal intracellular huntingtin protein aggregates that cause neuronal cell death. Currently, there are no approved treatments targeting the underlying cause of the disease and only one drug, tetrabenazine, has been approved for the treatment of the specific motor symptoms of Huntington’s disease.  Our Treatment Approach 
 We believe that AAV gene therapy is an attractive approach to treating Huntington’s disease. Since HTT mutations that cause Huntington’s disease are toxic gain-of-function mutations, we believe that we can employ an AAV gene therapy approach designed to knock down expression of the HTT gene. In addition, the targeted cells for treatment primarily reside in discrete regions of the brain - the striatum and the cortex - that can be targeted with AAV gene therapy delivered directly into the brain. The mechanism of action of VY-HTT01 is knockdown of HTT expression in neurons in the striatum and cortex, thereby reducing the level of toxicity associated with mutated protein in these brain regions, and slowing the progression of cognitive and motor symptoms. We believe that we can use the same surgical approach for this program that has been used for VY-AADC delivery to the brain, allowing us to leverage prior clinical experience.  Preclinical Studies 
 Our collaborators at Sanofi Genzyme have completed significant preclinical work focused on AAV gene therapy for Huntington’s disease. Sanofi Genzyme’s preclinical studies in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease demonstrated the safety and efficacy of AAV gene therapy targeting the knockdown of the HTT gene in the CNS. 
 As shown in the figure below, using an AAV vector delivered directly to the CNS, HTT gene expression was observed to be reduced by over 50%, on average, in the treatment group as compared to the control group. No signs of toxicity were reported.

 In addition, significant functional benefit was observed in the treatment group, as measured by the rotarod test to assess motor function, and the Porsolt Swim Test to measure depressive behavior in mice. In the figure below, both normal or wild type mice, and mice with the HTT mutation, or YAC128, were evaluated following treatment with either an AAV vector targeting the knockdown of the HTT gene, labeled as AAV2/1-miRNA-Htt below, or a negative control vector, labeled as AAV2/1-Null below. As expected, knocking down HTT in the control mice was observed to have no functional impact, whereas knocking down HTT in YAC128 mice was observed to have significant functional benefit.

 Our Program Status 
 VY-HTT01 is in preclinical development. Sanofi Genzyme’s Huntington’s disease gene therapy program was combined with our efforts in connection with entering into the Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration agreement in February 2015. Through our gene therapy platform, we also constructed and screened a series of microRNA expression cassettes and encoded payloads. Multiple rounds of optimization have resulted in potential candidates that are potent and selective for knocking down HTT. In addition, many construct configurations were evaluated toward the identification of one which would provide excellent yield and genome integrity for manufacturing scale-up in our baculovirus/Sf9 AAV manufacturing system in insect-derived cells. 
 We also conducted the necessary experiments to evaluate these potential lead candidates based upon criteria that include safety, selectivity, potency, and efficiency and precision of microRNA processing, leveraging the learnings from the VY-SOD101 program, including the miRNA cassettes and vector genome configurations that we designed for the VY-SOD101 program. In June 2017, we reported that we had selected a lead clinical candidate. 
 In preclinical studies, a single administration of VY-HTT01 was well-tolerated and resulted in robust and widespread knockdown of HTT messenger RNA at five weeks post-dosing in disease-relevant regions of the non-human primate central nervous system. The extent of HTT mRNA suppression (greater than 50%) and high precision and efficiency of primary microRNA processing in our preclinical studies supported the selection of our lead clinical candidate. Additionally, preclinical data in large mammals have demonstrated that a single intraputaminal administration results in robust knockdown of HTT in the putamen. 
 Recent preclinical delivery studies have further optimized the dosing paradigm. VT-HTT01 is composed of an adeno-associated virus capsid (AAV1) and proprietary transgene that harnesses the RNA interference pathway to selectively knock down, or reduce, levels of HTT mRNA. In late 2018, we presented results demonstrating significant 

 
  27

 
reduction of HTT mRNA at five weeks post-dosing in adult non-human primates using an MRI-guided surgical delivery of VY-HTT01 and a novel delivery paradigm targeting both the putamen and thalamus. Targeting the thalamus in addition to the putamen leverages more extensive and more preserved neuronal pathways to the cortex than delivery to the putamen alone. This novel dosing paradigm with VY-HTT01 resulted in safe and significant suppression of HTT in the striatum and in cortical neurons, which are critical in the progression of disease. A combined infusion of VY-HTT01 into the putamen and thalamus significantly reduced HTT mRNA by 68% in the caudate, 67% in the putamen, and 73% in the thalamus, on average, as measured from tissue punches, and by 32% on average, in laser captured cortical neurons, which was also supported by in situ hybridization for HTT mRNA. Further preclinical studies are underway with VY-HTT01 which, if successful, will support a potential filing of an IND application in 2019.
 Tau Program
 Disease Overview
 In healthy individuals, tau is an abundant soluble cytoplasmic protein that binds to microtubules, which are key structural proteins in cells, to promote their stability and function. In Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies, tau aggregates and forms insoluble tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. The progressive spread of tau pathology along distinct anatomical pathways in the brain closely correlates with disease progression and severity in a number of tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease, FTD, and PSP. In addition, mutations in the tau gene have been shown to cause inherited forms of tauopathies, including FTD and PSP. Because the extent of tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies closely correlates with the severity of neurodegeneration, synapse loss, and cognitive deficits, attempts to prevent, reduce, or slow the development of tau pathology have become important therapeutic strategies for these diseases.
 In previous preclinical studies in animal models, despite high weekly or biweekly systemic doses of anti-tau monoclonal antibodies administered over three to six months, only very low levels of antibody reached the brain, resulting in a modest reduction of tau pathology by ~40–50%. This incomplete and modest reduction in tau pathology following treatment with very high and frequent systemic doses of these antibodies may pose therapeutic challenges in humans with various tauopathies. To address these limitations, our AbbVie Tau Collaboration attempts to develop AAV gene therapies to deliver monoclonal antibodies to the brain directed against tau as potential new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and other tau-related neurodegenerative diseases.
 Our Program Status
 The tau program is currently in the preclinical stage. We have agreed to collaborate with AbbVie on the research and development of specified vectorized antibody compounds comprised of an AAV or other viral capsid and a virus vector genome that encodes one or more antibodies that target and bind to a tau protein. During the research period of our collaboration, we and AbbVie agreed to each identify up to five potential antibodies for evaluation during the AbbVie Tau Collaboration. Under the agreement, up to three research antibodies may be selected as candidates for creation of research compounds. AbbVie has the right to select two of the three research antibodies. During a specified portion of the research period, AbbVie may exercise one or more of its exclusive development options to select up to a total of three research compounds and their corresponding product candidates to proceed to the development period.  Severe, Chronic Pain Program: VY-NAV01
 Disease Overview
 Nav1.7 is a sodium ion channel that is required for transmission of pain signals to the CNS. We believe that an AAV gene therapy approach targeting the knockdown of Nav1.7 in sensory neurons could be an effective treatment for certain forms of severe, chronic pain. A major challenge for the successful development of small molecules and antibodies targeting Nav1.7 has been the selective inhibition of Nav1.7 over closely related sodium channels such as Nav1.5 which are important for cardiac function. MicroRNAs, which work by harnessing the RNA interference pathway, 

 
  28

 
can achieve a high level of specificity for their messenger RNA targets, and can inhibit Nav1.7 selectively over other sodium channel subtypes. Such an approach could avoid the dose-limiting side effects associated with the non-selective profile of many current drugs used to treat severe, chronic pain, and also achieve a durable clinical benefit following a single administration of the therapy. VY-NAV01 leverages our extensive experience designing novel microRNA knockdown cassettes and delivering them using AAV, an approach that we are using for our ALS and Huntington’s disease programs.
 Our Program Status
 VY-NAV01 is currently in the research stage. We are in the process of conducting proof-of-concept studies to establish the level of Nav1.7 knockdown needed to relieve pain in animal models. We will then identify a lead candidate which will comprise an optimal capsid, promoter, and microRNA targeting Nav1.7. We have also initiated proof-of-concept studies to evaluate knockdown of another sodium channel subtype implicated in chronic pain that may be combined with Nav1.7 knockdown. We are completing several AAV capsid screening experiments to identify capsids that effectively distribute to pain sensory neurons in a desired manner. We are comparing capsids in non-human primates following intrathecal and intravenous injection, and evaluating these capsids based upon multiple criteria including safety, overall level of transgene expression achieved, distribution of transgene expression and the specific cell types transduced. Future Programs 
 We are evaluating additional severe neurological diseases that could be treated using AAV gene therapy through application of either a gene replacement or a gene knockdown approach.  Collaborations and License Agreements
 Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration 
 In February 2015, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Sanofi Genzyme to leverage our combined expertise and assets to develop AAV gene therapies for neurological diseases. Under the agreement, we retained U.S. rights to VY-AADC and VY-FXN01, as well as at least co-commercialization rights to VY-HTT01 in the United States. In October 2017, Sanofi Genzyme decided not to exercise its option for the ex-U.S. rights to VY-AADC, returning global rights to VY-AADC to us. VY-SOD102 is not included as part of the Sanofi Genzyme collaboration and we retain unencumbered worldwide rights to this program. Sanofi Genzyme maintains exclusive options to license, develop and commercialize (i) the Split Territory Programs outside the United States with an incremental option to co-commercialize VY-HTT01 in the United States, and (ii) VY-SMN101 worldwide. Sanofi Genzyme’s option for the Split Territory Programs and VY-SMN101 is triggered following the completion of the first POP Study on a program-by-program basis. In November 2016, we and Sanofi Genzyme elected to deprioritize the development of VY-SMN101 for spinal muscular atrophy due to, among other things, the significant progress we have made in our other preclinical programs and the evolving competitive landscape.
 Prior to any option exercise by Sanofi Genzyme, we will collaborate with Sanofi Genzyme in the development of products under each Split Territory Program and VY-SMN101 pursuant to a written development plan and under the guidance of an alliance joint steering committee, comprised of an equal number of our employees and Sanofi Genzyme employees. 
 We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop products under each Split Territory Program and VY-SMN101 through completion of the applicable POP Study. During the development of our joint programs, our and Sanofi Genzyme’s activities are guided by a Development Advisory Committee, which we refer to as the DAC. The DAC may elect to utilize certain Sanofi Genzyme technology relating to the VY-AADC program, the VY-HTT01 Program, or generally with the manufacture of Split Territory Program products. If we use certain Sanofi Genzyme technology in VY-AADC, Sanofi Genzyme is entitled to received low single digit royalty payments based on a 

 
  29

 
percentage of net sales by us, and we may be obligated to make certain regulatory milestone payments to a third-party licensor. 
 We will be solely responsible for all costs incurred in connection with the development of Split Territory Programs and VY-SMN101 products prior to option exercise, subject to the following: (i) Sanofi Genzyme may agree to provide additional funds in return for agreed-upon payback or other agreed economic terms; (ii) we may request, and upon mutual agreement, Sanofi Genzyme will provide in-kind services valued at up to $5.0 million; and (iii) expenses of certain activities under the VY-HTT01 development plan may be funded to the extent such activities are reimbursed through financial support that Sanofi Genzyme may receive from a disease foundation group. 
 Excluding the VY-AADC program, if we do not initiate a POP Study for a given Split Territory Program by December 31, 2026 (or for the Future Program by the tenth anniversary of the date the Future Program is nominated by Sanofi Genzyme), and Sanofi Genzyme has not terminated this agreement with respect to such Collaboration program, then Sanofi Genzyme shall be entitled, at its sole and exclusive remedy, to a credit of $10.0 million for each such program against other amounts payable by Sanofi Genzyme under the Collaboration. However, if we do not initiate a POP Study by such date as a result of a regulatory delay or a force majeure event, such time period shall be extended for so long as such regulatory delay or force majeure event continues and we shall not be deemed to have failed to initiate a POP Study. 
 Post-Option Exercise 
 Upon Sanofi Genzyme’s exercise of its option to license a given product in a Split Territory Program, which we refer to as a Split Territory Licensed Product, we will have sole responsibility for the development of such Split Territory Licensed Product in the United States and Sanofi Genzyme shall have sole responsibility for development of such Split Territory Licensed Product in the rest of the world. We and Sanofi Genzyme will have shared responsibility for execution of ongoing development of such Split Territory Licensed Product that is not specific to either of our territories, including costs associated therewith. 
 A steering committee for each program will review and approve a written plan and budget for each relevant program. In addition, all development activities to be undertaken with respect to each Split Territory Licensed Product by or on behalf of either party will be set forth in a written development plan. 
 Sanofi Genzyme shall have the sole right to develop VY-SMN101 worldwide. Sanofi Genzyme shall be responsible for all of the development costs that occur after the option exercise date for VY-SMN101. 
 Commercialization 
 We shall be solely responsible, at our expense, for all commercialization activities relating to Split Territory Licensed Products in the United States. Sanofi Genzyme shall be solely responsible, at its expense, for all commercialization activities relating to Split Territory Licensed Products in the rest of the world. For VY-HTT01, if Sanofi Genzyme has exercised its option to co-commercialize VY-HTT01 in the United States, then Sanofi Genzyme will be the lead party responsible for all VY-HTT01 commercialization activities in the United States, and these activities will be set forth in reasonable detail in a written commercialization plan. 
 Sanofi Genzyme shall be solely responsible, at its expense, for all commercialization activities relating to VY-SMN101 worldwide. Sanofi Genzyme shall use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize VY-SMN101 in each major market specified in the agreement where Sanofi Genzyme has obtained required governmental approvals.
 Financial Terms 
 We received $65.0 million in upfront cash, a $30.0 million upfront equity investment and an in-kind commitment of $5.0 million, totaling $100.0 million. If Sanofi Genzyme exercises its option for a collaboration program, 

 
  30

 
Sanofi Genzyme is required to make an option exercise payment of $20.0 million or $30.0 million for each program. We are no longer entitled to receive the regulatory and commercial milestone payments from Sanofi Genzyme related to VY-AADC. Sanofi Genzyme shall pay us up to $540.0 million across the remaining product programs upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones. 
 In addition, to the extent any Split Territory Licensed Product or the VY-SMN101 Product is commercialized, we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments ranging from the mid-single digits to mid-teens based on a percentage of net sales. Sanofi Genzyme is entitled to receive royalty payments from us related to sales of the Split Territory Licensed Products ranging from the low-single digits to mid-single digits, depending on whether we use Sanofi Genzyme technology in a Split Territory Licensed Product or the VY-SMN101 Product. If Sanofi Genzyme exercises its option to co-commercialize VY-HTT01 in the United States, we will share any profits or losses from VY-HTT01 product sales. 
 Term and Termination; Remedies 
 Our collaboration agreement with Sanofi Genzyme will continue in effect until the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire of the option rights and (ii) the expiration of all payment obligations unless sooner terminated by us or Sanofi Genzyme. 
 We and Sanofi Genzyme have customary termination rights including the right to terminate for an uncured material breach of the agreement committed by the other party and Sanofi Genzyme has the right to terminate for convenience. 
 AbbVie Tau Collaboration
 In February 2018, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and option agreement with AbbVie, or the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement, for the research, development, and commercialization of AAV and other virus-based gene therapy products for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases related to defective or excess aggregation of tau protein in the human brain, including Alzheimer’s disease. 
 Under the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement, we have agreed to collaborate with AbbVie on the research and development of specified vectorized antibody compounds comprised of an AAV or other viral capsid and a virus vector genome that encodes one or more antibodies that target and bind to a tau protein. The collaboration is comprised of a research period, a development period, and an exclusive license option.

We are obligated to use diligent efforts to conduct antibody engineering and other research activities to create Research Compounds and to develop product candidates containing or comprised of such Research Compounds. We will be solely responsible for the costs and expenses during the Research Period. During a specified portion of the Research Period, or the Development Option Period, AbbVie may exercise one or more of its exclusive development options, each of which we refer to as a Development Option, to select up to a total of three Research Compounds, or the Selected Research Compounds, and their corresponding product candidates, or the Selected Product Candidates, to proceed to the development period. Development Period and AbbVie License Option
 During the development period, we are obligated to use diligent efforts to conduct development activities, including IND-enabling and Phase 1 clinical trial activities, for the Selected Research Compounds and corresponding 

 
  31

 
Selected Product Candidates. We will be solely responsible for the costs and expenses during the development period. During a specified portion of the development period, or the License Option Period, AbbVie may exercise its exclusive license option, or the License Option, to further develop and commercialize all of the Research Compounds, or the Licensed Compounds, and corresponding product candidates, or the Licensed Products. Upon AbbVie’s exercise of its License Option, we have agreed to grant to AbbVie an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize the Licensed Compounds and the Licensed Products for all human diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic uses. In addition, after AbbVie’s exercise of the License Option, we have certain obligations to complete any remaining research and development activities that have not been completed for any Research Compounds and Product Candidates.
 Governance
 Our research and development activities will be conducted pursuant to the plans agreed to by the parties and overseen by a joint governance committee, or JGC, comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party. Prior to AbbVie’s exercise of its License Option, we will have final decision-making authority within the JGC, subject to specified limitations; thereafter, AbbVie will have final decision-making authority, subject to specified limitations. Any material amendment to the research or development plans, however, must be mutually agreed to by the parties, which may be through the JGC. Commercialization
 Under the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement, AbbVie is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one Licensed Product in each of the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. After exercise of the License Option, AbbVie is solely responsible for all development and commercialization activities relating to Licensed Compounds and Licensed Products at its sole cost and expense (subject to our obligation to complete any remaining research and development activities set forth in the agreed-upon plans), except that we may elect to share in AbbVie’s development costs relating to a Licensed Product on an indication-by-indication basis in exchange for a specified increase in royalties. If we exercise this cost-sharing option, we may either reimburse AbbVie for AbbVie’s applicable development costs or, in the case of certain budget overruns, AbbVie may instead deduct applicable development costs, up to a specified cap, from milestone and royalty payments owed by AbbVie to us.  Manufacturing
 During both the research period and the development period, we will be solely responsible for the manufacture and supply of all pre-clinical and clinical requirements for the Research Compounds and Product Candidates. If AbbVie were to exercise its License Option, we would be required, at AbbVie’s request, to effect a full transfer of the manufacturing process for each Licensed Compound and corresponding Licensed Product to AbbVie. Following such transfer, we have agreed to disclose, on a continuing basis, all modifications, enhancements and improvements to manufacturing processes for the Licensed Products, and AbbVie has agreed to grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to modifications to the manufacturing process made by AbbVie, in each case subject to specified limitations.

  32

 
single digit to a mid-to-high teen (or, if we have exercised our cost-sharing option, low-twenties) percentage of aggregate net sales of Licensed Products on a Licensed Compound by Licensed Compound basis. The royalties are subject to potential reductions for biosimilar market penetration, patent claim expiration, and other provisions, subject to specified limits. For each Licensed Product, AbbVie may make a one-time request either to decrease its royalty payments to a specified low-single digit percentage or to terminate them altogether in exchange for a one-time payment by AbbVie at a fair market value to be negotiated by the parties. If the parties are not able to agree to the terms of such buy-down, the parties may seek a fair market value determination for the buy-down pursuant to dispute resolution procedures specified in the agreement. 
 Intellectual Property

Subject to a cure period, either we or AbbVie may terminate the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement, in whole or, in the case of us, in part, subject to specified conditions, in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. Either we or AbbVie may also terminate, subject to specified conditions, for insolvency of the other party, certain failures or delays to obtain certain regulatory clearances of the collaboration, or a joint determination of scientific infeasibility by the parties. AbbVie may terminate the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement (1) without cause, in its entirety or, after its exercise of the License Option, on a country-by-country basis, with 180 days’ prior written notice or (2) for our non-compliance with certain anti-bribery or anti-corruption covenants. We may terminate the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement, subject to specified conditions, if AbbVie or its affiliates challenge the validity or enforceability of certain of our, or jointly-held intellectual property rights. 
 Upon termination in certain cases, AbbVie has agreed to grant to us reversionary licenses to certain Licensed Compounds. In such case, we may be required to pay royalties to AbbVie in a range from a low to high single digit percentage of net sales of Licensed Products containing or comprised of such License Compound, subject to potential reduction in some cases. Additionally, upon termination in certain cases, the Vectorized Antibody Exclusivity and Research Antibody Exclusivity will survive until the third anniversary of the termination date. If the parties mutually agree to terminate for infeasibility or AbbVie terminates for our failure to deliver a final research or development report, neither us nor any of its affiliates may directly or indirectly exploit a vectorized antibody compound that targets or binds to a tau protein for 18 months after the termination date.
 Neurocrine Collaboration

 
  33

 


In January 2019, we entered into the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the research, development and commercialization of certain of our AAV gene therapy products. Under the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, upon the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods and the receipt of any required approvals or clearances including antitrust clearance, we have agreed to collaborate on the conduct of four collaboration programs, which we refer to collectively as the Neurocrine Programs: the AADC Program for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, our FA Program for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia including the development of the VY-FXN01 product candidate, which together with the AADC Program, we refer to as the Existing Programs, and two programs to be determined by us and Neurocrine at a later date, which we refer to as the Discovery Programs.Collaboration and Licenses

Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, subject to the rights retained by us thereunder, we have agreed to collaborate with Neurocrine on, and to grant, exclusive, royalty-bearing, non-transferable, sublicensable licenses to certain of our intellectual property rights, for all human and veterinary diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic uses, for the research, development, and commercialization of gene therapy products, which we refer to as the Collaboration Products, under (i) the AADC Program, on a worldwide basis; (ii) the FA Program, in the United States and, upon expiration of Sanofi Genzyme’s option to the FA Program pursuant to the Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration without exercise of such option, all countries in the world in which the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement remains in effect with respect to the FA Program; and (iii) each Discovery Program, on a worldwide basis.

   
Pursuant to development plans to be agreed by the parties, which will be overseen by a joint steering committee, or JSC, we have operational responsibility, subject to certain exceptions, for the conduct of each Neurocrine Program prior to the Transition Event for each Program, as described below, and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the Collaboration Products. Neurocrine has agreed to be responsible for all costs incurred by us in conducting these activities for each Neurocrine Program, in accordance with an agreed budget. If we breach our development responsibilities or in certain circumstances upon a change in control of us, Neurocrine has the right but not the obligation to assume the activities under such Neurocrine Program.

   
Upon the occurrence of a specified event for each Neurocrine Program, or a Transition Event, Neurocrine has agreed to assume responsibility for development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for such Neurocrine Program from us and to pay milestones and royalties on future net sales as described further below. For each Existing Program, we have the option, or a Co-Co Option, to co-develop and co-commercialize such Neurocrine Program upon the occurrence of a specified event, or a Co-Co Trigger Event. Should we elect to exercise our Co-Co Option, we have agreed to enter into a cost- and profit-sharing arrangement with Neurocrine, or a Co-Co Agreement, whereby we have agreed to jointly develop and commercialize Collaboration Products for such Neurocrine Program, or Co-Co Products, and share in its costs, profits and losses, and we agree to forfeit certain milestones and royalties on net sales in the United States during the effective period of the applicable Co-Co Agreement. The Transition Events are (i) with respect to the AADC Program, our receipt of topline data for the ongoing RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial for VY-AADC; (ii) with respect to the FA Program, our receipt of topline data for the initial Phase 1 clinical trial for an Friedreich’s ataxia program product candidate; and (iii) with respect to each Discovery Program, the preparation by us and the approval by Neurocrine of an investigational new drug application to be filed with the FDA by Neurocrine for the first development candidate in such Discovery Program. The Co-Co Trigger Events are (i) with respect to the AADC Program, our receipt of topline data for the ongoing RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial for VY-AADC and (ii) with respect to the FA Program, the achievement of milestones or metrics specified in the applicable development plan, as determined by the JSC.

   
Subject to exceptions specified in the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, profits and losses under our Co-Co Option are agreed to be allocated (i) 50% to Neurocrine and 50% to us for a Collaboration Product from the VY-AADC program and (ii) 60% to Neurocrine and 40% to us for a Collaboration Product from the FA Program; provided, however, that Neurocrine may elect, within a specified period following the acceptance for filing of a BLA from the FDA, to pay a $35.0 million rate-shifting fee to us to change the allocation for the VY-AADC Program to 55% to Neurocrine and 45% to us. The parties have agreed that each Co-Co Agreement will provide us the right to terminate for any reason upon prior written notice to Neurocrine and Neurocrine the right to terminate in certain circumstances upon our change of control.

Governance

Our research and development activities under the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement are to be conducted pursuant to plans agreed to by the parties, on a program-by-program basis, and overseen by the JSC, which is composed of an equal number of representatives from the parties. The JSC may delegate matters within its authority to subcommittees of the JSC. In addition, the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement establishes working groups to handle specified matters on a subject matter-by-subject matter basis. If a working group or subcommittee cannot agree on a matter within its purview within a specified time, such matter is to be referred sequentially to the JSC and then the executive officers of the parties. If the executive officers are not able to resolve the matter, then (i) with respect to each Existing Program, subject to specified exceptions, (x) Neurocrine has the right to resolve such matter prior to our exercise of our Co-Co Option with regard to such Co-Co Product or if such Co-Co Option expires or goes unexercised and (y) following the timely exercise by us of our Co-Co Option, depending on the subject of such matter, either Neurocrine, in certain instances, or the parties jointly or the JSC, in other instances, would have the right to resolve such matter, and (ii) with respect to Discovery Programs, subject to specified exceptions, Neurocrine has the right to resolve such matter.Candidate Selection

The parties have committed, following the effective date of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, to agree on a list of up to eight target genes, or Targets, from which Neurocrine has the right to nominate Targets for the two Discovery Programs. Each Target for the Discovery Programs must be approved by a consensus of the JSC or the executive officers.Manufacturing

Prior to the Transition Event for a Neurocrine Program, we are responsible for the manufacture of any Collaboration Products for the Program. Following the Transition Event, the parties shall negotiate the manufacturing and supply responsibilities, subject to the terms of any applicable Co-Co Agreement.Financial Terms

Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, Neurocrine has agreed to pay us an upfront payment of $115.0 million within five business days after the effective date, and $50.0 million as an equity purchase of 4,179,728 shares to purchase our common stock. The Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement provides for aggregate development milestone payments from Neurocrine to us for Collaboration Products under (i) the AADC Program of up to $170.0 million; (ii) the FA Program of up to $195.0 million, and (iii) each of the two Discovery Programs of up to $130.0 million per Discovery Program. We may be entitled to receive aggregate commercial milestone payments for each Collaboration Product of up to $275.0 million, subject to an aggregate cap on commercial milestones across all Neurocrine Programs of $1.1 billion.

Neurocrine has also agreed to pay us royalties, based on future net sales of the Collaboration Products. Such royalty percentages, for net sales in and outside the United States, as applicable, range (i) for the VY-AADC program, from the mid-teens to thirty and the low-teens to twenty, respectively; (ii) for the FA Program, from the low-teens to high-teens and high-single digits to mid-teens, respectively; and (iii) for each Discovery Program, from the high-single digits to mid-teens and mid-single digits to low-teens, respectively. On a country-by-country and program-by-program basis, royalty payments would commence on the first commercial sale of a Collaboration Product and terminate on the later of (a) the expiration of the last patent covering the Collaboration Product or its method of use in such country, (b) 10 years from the first commercial sale of the Collaboration Product in such country and (c) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or the Royalty Term. Royalty payments may be reduced by up to 50% in specified circumstances, including expiration of patents rights related to a Collaboration Product, approval of biosimilar products in a given country or required payment of licensing fees to third parties related to the development and commercialization of any Collaboration Product. Additionally, the licenses granted to Neurocrine shall automatically 

 
  35

 
convert to fully paid-up, non-royalty bearing, perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive licenses on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the expiration of the Royalty Term applicable to such Collaboration Product in such country.

Intellectual Property

Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement and subject to specified exceptions therein, each party owns the entire right, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights made solely by its employees or agents in the course of the collaboration. The parties jointly own all rights, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights made or invented jointly by employees or agents of both parties.Exclusivity

During the term of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, neither party nor any of its respective affiliates is permitted to directly or indirectly exploit any AAV-based gene therapy products directed to a Target to which a Collaboration Product is directed, subject to specified exceptions, including the parties’ conduct of basic research and our activities under the Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration.Termination

Unless earlier terminated, the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement expires on the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire Royalty Term with respect to a Collaboration Product in all countries in the relevant territory or (ii) the expiration or termination of all Co-Co Agreements. Neurocrine may terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a program-by-program or country-by-country basis by providing at least (x) 180-day advance notice if such notice is provided prior to the first commercial sale of the Collaboration Product to which the termination applies or (y) one-year advance notice if such notice is provided after the first commercial sale of the Collaboration Product to which the termination applies. We may terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, subject to specified conditions, if (i) Neurocrine fails to make the equity purchase of 4,179,728 shares of our common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50.0 million, or (ii) Neurocrine challenges the validity or enforceability of certain of our intellectual property rights. Subject to a cure period, either party may terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions. Either party may also terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement if specified regulatory agencies seek to enjoin the transaction or if the parties are unable to obtain antitrust clearance within 180 days of the applicable antitrust filings.

    Upon termination in certain cases, Neurocrine has agreed to grant to us licenses to certain Neurocrine intellectual property, subject to a negotiation between the parties to establish royalty rates for use of such intellectual property. In the event of a breach by us with respect to a Neurocrine Program, if such termination were to occur after a Transition Event, then (i) if a Co-Co Agreement is in effect with respect to such program, Neurocrine can terminate the Co-Co Agreement for such program and we would no longer have co-development and co-commercialization rights with respect to the Collaboration Product and (ii) subject to any license agreements, Neurocrine would no longer have any obligations with respect to any Collaboration Products resulting from such program.
     AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration
 In February 2019, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and option agreement, the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement, with AbbVie, for the research, development and commercialization of AAV and other virus-based gene therapy products directed against pathological species of alpha-synuclein for the potential treatment of indications including Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies.
 Collaboration and AbbVie Options 
 Under the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement, we and AbbVie have agreed to collaborate on the research and development of specified vectorized antibody compounds comprised of an AAV or other viral capsid 

 
  36

 
and a virus vector genome that encodes one or more antibodies that target and bind to the alpha-synuclein protein. The collaboration is comprised of a research period and a development period.
 Research Period and AbbVie Development Option
 During the research period, we are obligated to conduct research activities directed to constructing one or more virus vectors that encode antibodies designated by AbbVie, or AbbVie Designated Antibodies, which initially are to be antibodies provided by AbbVie. We are obligated to use diligent efforts to conduct research activities to create research compounds and to develop product candidates containing or comprised of such research compounds. We are solely responsible for the costs and expenses during the research period. During a specified portion of the research period, AbbVie may exercise one or more of its exclusive development options to select up to a total of four research compounds and their corresponding Product candidates to proceed to the development period. Development Period and AbbVie License Option
 During the development period, we are obligated to use diligent efforts to conduct development activities, including IND application-enabling and Phase 1 clinical trial activities, for the selected research compounds and corresponding selected product candidates. We are solely responsible for the costs and expenses during the development period. During a specified portion of the development period, AbbVie may exercise its exclusive license option to further develop and commercialize all of the research compounds and corresponding product candidates. Upon AbbVie’s exercise of its license option, we have agreed to grant to AbbVie an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize the licensed compounds and the licensed products for all human diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic uses. In addition, after AbbVie’s exercise of the license option, we have certain obligations to complete any remaining research and development activities that have not been completed for any research compounds and product candidates. Governance
 Our research and development activities are to be conducted pursuant to the plans agreed to by the parties and overseen by a joint governance committee, or the ASN JGC, comprised of an equal number of representatives from each of us and AbbVie. Prior to AbbVie’s exercise of its License Option, we have final decision-making authority within the ASN JGC, subject to specified limitations; thereafter, AbbVie is entitled to final decision-making authority, subject to specified limitations. Any material amendment to the research or development plans, however, must be mutually agreed to by the parties, which may be through the ASN JGC. Commercialization
 Under the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement, AbbVie is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product in each of the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. After exercise of the license option, AbbVie is solely responsible for all development and commercialization activities relating to licensed compounds and licensed products at its sole cost and expense, subject to our obligation to complete any remaining research and development activities set forth in the agreed-upon plans. Manufacturing
 During both the research period and the development period, we are solely responsible for the manufacture and supply of all pre-clinical and clinical requirements for the research compounds and product candidates. If AbbVie were to exercise its license option, we would be required, at AbbVie’s request, to effect a full transfer of the manufacturing process for each licensed compound and corresponding licensed product to AbbVie. Following such transfer, we have agreed to disclose, on a continuing basis, all modifications, enhancements and improvements to manufacturing processes for the licensed products, and AbbVie has agreed to grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to modifications to the manufacturing process made by AbbVie, in each case, subject to specified limitations.

 Financial
 Under the terms of the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement, AbbVie has agreed to pay us an upfront payment of $65.0 million within 15 business days of entry into the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement. AbbVie has also agreed to pay to us, within 30 days after the applicable exercise date: (1) upon AbbVie’s exercise of a development option, (a) $80.0 million for the first selected research compound and its corresponding selected product candidate and (b) $30.0 million each for up to three additional selected research compounds and their corresponding selected product candidates, and (2) upon AbbVie’s exercise of the license option, a one-time payment of $75.0 million. We are eligible to receive (1) specified regulatory milestone payments for each licensed compound of up to an aggregate of $450.0 million in the case of a Parkinson’s disease indication and up to $185.0 million in the case of the first indication other than Parkinson’s disease and $92.5 million for a subsequent non-Parkinson’s disease indication; (2) specified commercial milestone payments for all licensed products for all indications up to an aggregate of $500.0 million; and (3) tiered, escalating royalties, in the mid-single digit percentage range for aggregate net sales of licensed products on a licensed compound by licensed compound basis. The royalties are subject to potential reductions for biosimilar market penetration, patent claim expiration, and other provisions, subject to specified limits. Subject to certain exceptions, we and AbbVie have agreed to be financially responsible for all payments owed to a third party with which it has contracted for any use of in-licensed intellectual property under the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement. Intellectual Property
 Under the terms of the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement, each party owns the entire right, title and interest in and to all know-how and patent rights first made or invented solely by it or its affiliates or its or their sublicensees in the course of the collaboration, with certain specified exceptions. Also subject to specified exceptions, the parties jointly own all rights, title and interest in and to all know-how and patent rights first made or invented jointly by such party or its affiliates or its or their sublicensees in the course of the collaboration. Regardless of whether AbbVie has exercised a development option or the license option, we have agreed to grant AbbVie perpetual, exclusive or non-exclusive (as the case may be), worldwide licenses to certain know-how and patent rights developed by the Company or jointly by the parties arising from the collaboration. Exclusivity
 During the term of the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement, (1) neither party nor any of its respective affiliates is permitted to directly or indirectly exploit any vectorized antibody compound targeting the alpha-synuclein protein, or Vectorized Antibody Exclusivity and (2) neither us nor any of our affiliates is permitted to directly or indirectly exploit any AbbVie Designated Antibody, in each case subject to specified exceptions, including AbbVie’s conduct of basic research. Termination
 Unless earlier terminated, the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement expires on the earliest to occur of the expiration of (1) the development option period, without AbbVie’s exercise of a development option; (2) the license option period, without AbbVie’s exercise of its license option; and (3) the last-to-expire royalty term with respect to all licensed products in all countries. Subject to a cure period, either party may terminate the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement, in whole or, in the case of us, in part, subject to specified conditions, in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. Either party may also terminate, subject to specified conditions, for insolvency of the other party, certain failures or delays to obtain certain regulatory clearances of the collaboration, or a joint determination of scientific infeasibility by the parties. AbbVie may terminate the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement (1) without cause, in its entirety or, after its exercise of the license option, on a country-by-country basis, with 180 days’ prior written notice or (2) for our non-compliance with certain anti-bribery or anti-corruption covenants. We may terminate the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement, subject to specified conditions, if AbbVie or its affiliates challenge the validity or enforceability of certain of our or jointly-held intellectual property rights.

 
  38

 

 Upon termination in certain cases, the Vectorized Antibody Exclusivity and AbbVie Designated Exclusivity survives until the third anniversary of the termination date. If the parties mutually agree to terminate for infeasibility or AbbVie terminates for our failure to deliver a final research or development report, neither we nor any of our affiliates may directly or indirectly exploit a vectorized antibody compound that targets or binds to the alpha-synuclein protein for 18 months after the termination date.
 License Agreement with University of Massachusetts
 On January 30, 2014, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Massachusetts, or UMass, pursuant to which UMass granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to certain of its licensed patents to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold and import certain licensed products in the field of human diseases that use gene therapy applications. Our license is subject to any rights that may be required to be granted to the government of the United States, and UMass reserves the right to use the licensed patents for education and research and, with our consent, for non-commercial patient care, without the payment of any compensation to us. 
 In consideration for rights granted to us under the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $0.2 million to UMass. We are obligated to pay UMass (i) low-single digit royalty payments based on net sales of the licensed products, (ii) annual maintenance payments of $30.0 thousand, which are creditable against royalties payable in such period, (iii) minimum aggregate annual royalty payments that are creditable against royalties payable in such period, with the minimum aggregate amount payable being in the low-six digits for each of the first four years of this agreement and a minimum aggregate amount payable being in the mid-six digits for each year, thereafter, (iv) milestone payments of up to $1.8 million, per licensed product for the first five licensed products, based on the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and (v) a percentage of sublicensing income that decreases over time from low double digit percentages to a mid-single digit percentage. We also agreed to reimburse UMass approximately $0.7 million for patent related expenses incurred by UMass as of the effective date of the agreement over a two-year period. 
 Under the agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products and to introduce such licensed products into the commercial market, and further agreed to certain development milestones. 
 The agreement will terminate on the date that is the later of (i) seven years after the first commercial sale of the last licensed product under the agreement or (ii) such time as there are no valid claims covering a licensed product. We have the right to terminate the agreement for any reason upon 90 days prior written notice, and we and UMass have the right to terminate the agreement if the other party fails to cure a written breach within 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach. 
 MassBiologics and UMass Collaboration Agreement
 On October 20, 2014, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with UMass and MassBiologics, pursuant to which we shall (i) fund certain projects that will be conducted by UMass or MassBiologics, (ii) fund certain educational programs of UMass, including post-doctoral research at our laboratories beginning in 2015 and an annual lecture series beginning in 2015 and (iii) collaborate with MassBiologics to establish scalable processes for manufacturing recombinant AAV vector products using cGMP. 
 In November 2014, we agreed to the first project under this agreement whereby we funded approximately $2.9 million over a 16-month period for certain research and development services performed by MassBiologics. The project commenced in January 2015 and completed during 2016. We and UMass and/or MassBiologics may agree to conduct other projects in the future, the terms of which will be agreed upon at such time. 
 This agreement will remain in effect for a period of five years and automatically renews for additional one-year periods. Either party has the right to terminate this agreement, once in each renewal period, for any reason upon providing the other party with 90 days written notice or in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party that is not cured within 60 days of written notice. 

 
  39

 

 We will own all intellectual property rights generated under this agreement, either by our employees, UMass and/or MassBiologics employees, or jointly by our employees and UMass and/or MassBiologics employees, that cover AAV materials. We and UMass and/or MassBiologics, as applicable, will jointly own any intellectual property rights generated under this agreement jointly by our employees and the employees of UMass and/or MassBiologics, as applicable, that do not cover AAV materials. 
 License Agreement with REGENX 
 In May 2014, we entered into a license agreement with REGENXBIO Inc., formerly known as ReGenX Biosciences, LLC, or REGENX, for the development and commercialization of gene therapies to treat ALS, Friedreich’s ataxia and Huntington’s disease. Under this license agreement, REGENX granted us a non-exclusive worldwide license to make, have made and use its technology solely for internal research and preclinical development for the identification of specific vectors that could be commercialized. Following identification, we have an option to obtain a non-exclusive worldwide license under the licensed intellectual property to a single specified AAV vector to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale licensed products using the selected vector, which can be exercised for each of ALS, Friedreich’s ataxia, or Huntington’s disease. Under the terms of this license agreement, we paid REGENX an upfront fee of $0.5 million, an extension fee of $0.1 million and are required to pay an annual maintenance fee. 
 In November 2016, we exercised commercial options for the use of REGENX’s NAV® Technology Platform, or NAV, vectors for the development and commercialization of gene therapies for specific neurological diseases. Upon exercise of the options, REGENX has granted us a non-exclusive worldwide commercial license, with rights to sublicense, to three specific NAV vector sequences covered by REGENX’s NAV Technology Platform, each for the treatment of a specific neurological disease. In return for these rights, we paid upfront payments of $1.05 million and have paid to REGENX an annual maintenance fee payment of five digits based on the number of disease indication options exercised. In addition, we will be required to pay to REGENX up to $5.0 million in milestone fees per disease indication, mid- to high-single digit royalty percentages on net sales of licensed products, and low- to mid-single digit percentages of any sublicense fees that we receive from sublicensees for the licensed intellectual property rights. 
 Our license agreement with REGENX will expire upon the expiration, lapse, abandonment, or invalidation of the last claim of the licensed intellectual property to expire, lapse, or become abandoned or unenforceable in all the countries of the world
 We may terminate the license agreement upon a specified number of days prior written notice. REGENX may terminate the license agreement if we, our affiliates, or sublicensees experience insolvency, if we are more than a specified number of days late in paying money due under the license agreement, or, effective immediately, if we or our affiliates commence any action against REGENX or its licensors to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid or unenforceable. Either party may terminate the license agreement for material breach that is not cured within a specified number of days.
 In February 2019, we provided notice to REGENX of our intent to terminate our commercial license. Upon the effective date of the termination, we are required to grant to REGENX a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable license to certain improvements made by us during the term of the license (including any intellectual property rights with respect thereto). This grant back will allow for REGENX’s use of the improvements in the research, development or commercialization of products in any therapeutic indication.
 Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop into products and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our gene therapy platform, product programs, product candidates and scientific expertise in the fields of gene therapy and neuroscience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from various 

 
  40

 
sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. 
 We are aware of several companies focused on developing AAV gene therapies in various indications, including Abeona Therapeutics, Inc., Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc., Aevitas Therapeutics, Inc., Agilis Biotherapeutics, LLC, which was acquired by PTC Therapeutics, Inc. in 2018, Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc., Audentes Therapeutics, Inc., AveXis, Inc., or AveXis which was acquired by Novartis in 2018, Axovant Sciences Ltd., GenSight Biologics SA, LogicBio Therapeutics, Inc., Lysogene SA, MeiraGTx Ltd., NightstaRx Ltd, Prevail Therapeutics, Inc., REGENXBio Inc., Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., Solid Biosciences, Inc., uniQure NV, or uniQure, Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer, and Spark Therapeutics, Inc., or Spark, as well as several companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. Any advances in gene therapy technology made by a competitor may be used to develop therapies that could compete against any of our product candidates. 
 We expect that VY-AADC will compete with a variety of therapies currently marketed and in development for Parkinson’s disease, including DBS marketed by Medtronic plc, Abbott Laboratories (acquired from St. Jude Medical in 2017), and other medical device companies, DUOPA/Duodopa marketed by AbbVie Inc., as well as other novel, non-oral forms of levodopa in development, including Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma’s ND0612 (acquired from NeuroDerm in 2017), Acorda Therapeutics’ inhaled levodopa, INBRIJA (CVT-301), and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals’, or Sunovion’s, sublingual apomorphine, APL-130277. Gene therapy competition for Parkinson’s disease previously included AMT-090 or AAV-GDNF, but this was deprioritized by uniQure in 2016. Axovant Sciences Ltd. is developing a second generation LentiVector gene therapy, AXO-Lenti-PD (previously OXB-102, licensed from Oxford Biomedica in 2018). MeiraGTx is developing AAV-GAD, acquired from Vector Neurosciences, Inc. in 2018. 
 We expect that our preclinical programs will compete with a variety of therapies in development, including:

· | VY-SOD102 for a monogenic form of ALS will potentially compete with IONIS-SOD1Rx being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, in collaboration with Biogen Inc., or Biogen, and a gene therapy being developed by AveXis;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | VY-FXN01 for Friedreich’s ataxia will potentially compete with AAV gene therapies being developed by Pfizer and by Agilis Biotherapeutics, LLC (acquired by PTC Therapeutics, Inc. in 2018), and BMN 290 being developed by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | VY-HTT01 for Huntington’s disease will potentially compete with IONIS-HTTRx being developed by Ionis in collaboration with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., or Roche, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 being developed by WAVE Life Sciences in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceuticals, a Zinc Finger Protein (ZFP) therapy being developed by Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. in collaboration with Shire plc, and gene therapies being developed by uniQure and Spark;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of product candidates and commercializing those product candidates. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for product candidates and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ product candidates may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. 
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new product candidates enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any product candidates that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Manufacturing
 The manufacture of gene therapy products is technically complex, and necessitates substantial expertise and capital investment. Production difficulties caused by unforeseen events may delay the availability of material for our clinical studies. To meet the requirements of our current and planned future trials we have developed a proprietary manufacturing platform that provides a robust and scalable process for AAV production. We are using the baculovirus/Sf9 AAV production system, a technology for producing AAV vectors at scale in insect-derived cells. We focus on developing internal processes and capabilities to produce high-yield and high-quality gene therapies. The process has been successfully transferred to our contract manufacturing organizations where it is used in manufacturing of clinical materials in accordance with the FDA’s cGMP. We have entered into agreements with Brammer Bio and Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies to further expand our manufacturing capabilities to support the development of our gene therapy programs. We have also built an onsite, state-of-the-art process research and development facility to enable the manufacturing of high quality AAV gene therapy vectors at laboratory scale.
 We presently contract with third parties for the manufacturing of our program materials. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively cost efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with manufacturing and quality experience to oversee our contract manufacturers.

 Intellectual Property
 Overview 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology, inventions, and know-how to enhance improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology platform, on continuing technological innovation and on in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the strength of our position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. 
 Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other protections for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and intellectual property rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third-party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. 
 We have 182 patent applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. At least 28 patent applications have been filed and are pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions by or on behalf of universities which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, 72 patents have issued to our licensors which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, 148 patents have issued to our licensors which have granted us non-exclusive license rights to the technology with 64 applications pending. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek United States and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including: research tools and methods, methods for transferring genetic material into cells, AAV-based biological products, methods of designing novel AAV constructs, methods for treating diseases of interest and methods for manufacturing our AAV-based products. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel biological products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various other license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development.

Government Regulation and Product Approval
 In the United States, biological products, including gene therapy products, are licensed by FDA for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Both the FDCA and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, import, export, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA clearance must be obtained before clinical testing of biological products, and each clinical study protocol for a gene therapy product is reviewed by the FDA and, in some instances, the NIH, through its RAC. FDA licensure also must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (OTAT) is responsible for gene therapy review and evaluation. CBER works closely with the NIH and its RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, viral shedding, environmental assessments, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs. FDA guidance documents provide the agency’s current thinking about a particular subject but are not legally binding. 
 U.S. Biological Products Development Process 
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation of clinical trial material in accordance with good manufacturing practices, or GMPs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, assessing the safety of the clinical research and identifying any potential risk to public health or the environment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity, potency, and efficacy, of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of a BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, potency, and efficacy from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection prior to BLA approval of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  47

 


· | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potential FDA Advisory Committee meeting to elicit expert input on critical issues and including a vote by external Committee members;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, and payment of associated user fees; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with any post approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical tests, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 Previously, when a gene therapy study was conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation was to be submitted to and the study was registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines was mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines had voluntarily followed them. Under an FDA and NIH proposal in 2018, the role of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, in reviewing gene therapy protocols would be entirely eliminated and sponsors would no longer be required to submit reports to NIH on such protocols. Going forward, NIH says the RAC will continue to function as an advisory board to NIH on emerging fields such as gene editing, synthetic biology and neurotechnology. 
 The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing typically continues after the IND is submitted. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA requests certain changes to a protocol before the study can begin, or the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals 

 
  48

 
participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic (or both) nucleic acid molecules performed at or sponsored by an institution that receives any NIH funding for such research also must be reviewed by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

· | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Guidelines on clinical trials with gene therapy products issued by OTAT state that the FDA has determined that the benefit-risk ratio of these products does not warrant their evaluation in healthy human subjects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of trial subjects. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System which includes information on gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic 

 
  49

 
tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these studies. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, including draft guidance documents released in July 2018 relating to gene therapies for human retinal disorders and gene therapies for rare diseases, and on January 15, 2019, the FDA issued a statement that it would issue additional guidance to facilitate the development of gene therapy products.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.

Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use

Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application.

When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.

On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended) a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect. This provision requires drug and biologic companies to make publicly available their policies for expanded access for individual patient access to products intended for serious diseases.

Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access 

 
  50

 
program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA, must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2019 is $309,915. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication.    Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The application also needs to be published and submitted in an electronic format that can be processed through the FDA’s electronic systems. If the electronic submission is not compatible with FDA’s systems, the BLA can be refused to file. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.

 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. As a condition for approval, the FDA may also require additional non-clinical testing as a Phase 4 commitment. 
 One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review standard BLAs in 10 months from filing and priority BLAs in six months from filing, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Following approval, the manufacturing facilities are subject to biennial inspections by the FDA’s biologics team and such inspections may result in an issuance of FDA Form 483 deficiency observations or a warning letter, which can lead to plant shutdown and other more serious penalties and fines. Prior to the institution of any manufacturing changes, a determination needs to be made whether FDA approval is required in advance. If not done in accordance with FDA expectations, the FDA may restrict supply and may take further action. Annual product reports are required to be submitted annually. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. Systems need to be put in place to record and evaluate adverse events reported by health care providers and patients and to assess product complaints. An increase in severity or new adverse events can result in labeling changes or product recall. Defects in manufacturing of commercial products can result in product recalls. 

 
  52

 

 We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or license revocation, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation, or ODD, to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. ODD does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has ODD receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as not being able to supply the product for patients or showing clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
 Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.

 Expedited Review and Approval Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of biological products that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new biological products to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a biological product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.    The FDA may give a priority review designation to biological products that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation may also be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 In addition, biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the biological product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a biological product receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the biological product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
 Moreover, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a biological product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biological product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Biological products designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process. 
 Expedited programs for regenerative medicine therapies for serious conditions 
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress amended the FDCA to create an expedited development and approval program for regenerative medicine advanced therapies, which include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. As of November 2017, the FDA has interpreted this definition as follows: gene therapies, including genetically modified cells, that lead to a durable modification of cells or tissues may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine advanced 

 
  54

 
therapy. The FDA has now determined that ‘in vitro’ gene therapies will qualify as a regenerative medicine advanced therapy based on this definition. VY-AADC is an ‘in vitro’ gene therapy for Parkinson’s disease and received this designation on June 18, 2018. Regenerative medicine advanced therapies do not include those human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. The new program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine advanced therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. 
 A drug sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug as a regenerative medicine advanced therapy concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A new drug application or BLA for a regenerative medicine advanced therapy may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through (1) surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit or (2) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with the FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine advanced therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, less any time the applicant failed to act with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.  Market and Data Exclusivity
 The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. As of January 1, 2019, the FDA has approved 17 biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidance is expected to be finalized by FDA in the near term.

Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the FDA must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that 

 
  55

 
the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.

Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.

Pediatric Exclusivity

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or patent protection, including the non‑patent and orphan exclusivity. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if an application sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. Thus, pediatric exclusivity adds six months to existing exclusivity periods applicable to biological products under the BPCIA—namely, the four-year period during which the FDA will not consider an application for a biosimilar product, and the 12-year period during which the FDA will not approve a biosimilar application. Other Healthcare Laws 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 In addition, the ACA is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, in addition to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 included in the ACA, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. 

The current administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders which delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. 

 
  56

 
One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the Trump administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known.
 With enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.”  The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective January 1, 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices.

Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on May 11, 2018, the Trump administration issued a plan to lower drug prices. Under this blueprint for action, the Trump administration indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services will: take steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies; advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition; evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers’ ads to enhance price competition; speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers; avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid; work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers; examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans, and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program; update Medicare’s drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency; prohibit Part D contracts that include “gag rules” that prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance; and require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases.
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription product and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our 

 
  57

 
product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. 
 Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.  U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.

Review and Clearance of Companion Diagnostics in the United States 

If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products.

If FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device or delivery device (combination product) is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic or delivery device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic or delivery device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s CDRH Office.

Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. 

The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must 

 
  58

 
prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to fees for medical device product review. For federal fiscal year 2019, the standard fee for review of a PMA was $322,147 and the small business fee was $80,537. 
 A 510(k) must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device, or predicate device, that did not require premarket approval. In evaluating a 510(k), the FDA will determine whether the device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and (a) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or (b) has different technological characteristics, and (i) the data supporting substantial equivalence contains information, including appropriate clinical or scientific data, if deemed necessary by the FDA, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and as effective as a legally marketed device, and (ii) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. Most 510(k)s do not require clinical data for clearance, but the FDA may request such data. The FDA seeks to review and act on a 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but it may take longer if the agency finds that it requires more information to review the 510(k). If the FDA concludes that a new device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the new device will be classified in Class III and the manufacturer will be required to submit a PMA to market the product. On July 23, 2018, the CDRH of the FDA cleared the 510(k) for our V-TAGTM device that is compatible for use with MRIs. 
 Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials, e.g., a clinical trial application for each clinical trial for each EU country in which the trial is conducted; a clinical trial notification is required in Japan. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement for Biopharmaceutical Products 
 Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
