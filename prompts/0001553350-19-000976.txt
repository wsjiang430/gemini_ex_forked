GENERAL

We were incorporated in Nevada on September 10, 2013, as Betafox Corp. Our limited business until May 11, 2015, when control of our Company changed, was attempting to make candles. Because previous management was unable to raise sufficient capital to enable our Company to develop its intended operations, on that date, Mr. Giorgos Kallides, our previous majority shareholder and sole officer and director, sold his 6,000,000 shares to Future Continental Limited, and resigned all of his positions with our Company. Mr. Pei Lei became our new CEO and Chief Financial Officer, and, as part of the change of control, (a) Mr. Kallides cancelled his loan of $11,672 which was owed to him by our Company, and (b) our previously limited operation was sold to Mr. Kallides for $1 (see Item 11 herein). In October 2015, Future Continental Limited transferred the 6,000,000 shares to Mr. Lei Pei, in consideration of Mr. Pei serving as, and continuing to serve as, our director and CEO. In November 2015, we changed our corporate name to Future World Group, Inc.; and on February 26, 2017, we changed our corporate name to Global Entertainment Clubs, Inc, and again on January 8, 2018 to WEWARDS, INC. The Companys trading symbol is now WEWA.

On August 8, 2016, Mr. Peis 100%-owned company Sky Rover Holdings, Ltd. (Sky Rover) loaned us $1,000,000 (the Loan), pursuant to a three-year, unsecured promissory note bearing interest at 5% (payable in cash or in kind at our option), and convertible into our common shares at $.04 per share (including interest payable in kind). The proceeds of the Loan were used for working capital. On March 5, 2018, this loan and accrued interest of $79,990 was converted in full, into 26,999,750 common shares; and Sky Rover agreed to have all 26,999,750 shares issued directly to Mr. Pei, its 100% owner.

On September 27, 2016, Sky Rover loaned us an additional $2,000,000 to the Registrant. Sky Rover was issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the Note), which was convertible into the Registrants common shares at any time before the due date, at a conversion price of $.04 per share. On March 5, 2018, this loan and accrued interest of $144,148 was converted in full, into 53,603,700 common shares. These shares were also issued directly to Mr. Pei.

On February 26, 2017, Sky Rover agreed to loan us up to an additional $20,000,000 to the Registrant, of which $8,000,000 was loaned to the Registrant on February 28, 2017. The loan of the $8,000,000, combined with the $4,000,000 which was loaned to the Registrant by Sky Rover since August 2016, means that Sky Rover has loaned a total of $12,000,000 in convertible notes to the Registrant since August, 2016, through February 28, 2017. Sky Rover and the Registrant have not determined when the balance of the $20,000,000 loan will be completed, and it is subject to the terms being agreed upon, i.e., the interest rate, conversion price, and due date.

The $8,000,000 loan which was made by Sky Rover to the Registrant on February 28, 2017 is evidenced by an unsecured promissory note (the  $8,000,000 Note), bearing interest at 5% per year (payable quarterly in cash or in stock, in Registrants option, at the conversion price), is due in three years (on February 26, 2020), and is convertible into the Registrants common shares at any time before the due date, at a conversion price of $.08 per share (subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, forward splits, recapitalizations, a merger, etc.). The Registrant and its affiliate Sky Rover intend, but cannot confirm at this time, that the conversion price of any of the up to $12,000,000 additional loans will be at a conversion price at least equal to the $.08 conversion price of the $8,000,000 loan.

On June 26, 2018, Sky Rover converted $1,500,000 of this $8,000,000 loan, waived all interest, and issued 18,750,000 shares, 14,750,000 shares of which are owned by Mr. Pei, and 4,000,000 shares of which were gifted to other persons, all nonaffiliates of the Company.

If and when Sky Rover converts the remaining $6,500,000 of the $8,000,000 Note at the present conversion price of $.08 per share to 81,250,000 shares, and authorizes those shares to be issued to Mr. Pei, he would then own 182,603,450 of the Registrants 188,733,450 then-issued and outstanding shares (assuming that no other shares are issued before conversion), which would be approximately 96.75% of the then-outstanding shares.

On June 26, 2018, the Company repaid Sky Rover a total of $5,000,000 in loans previously made by Sky Rover to the Company, consisting of an unsecured $1,000,000 non-convertible loan of February 23, 2017, and $4,000,000 of the convertible promissory note issued on February 26, 2017. Sky Rover waived all accrued and unpaid interest with respect to all $5,000,000 of these repaid loans and agreed that the loans will be repaid directly to Mr. Pei, its 100% owner.

The Merchant Platform (the Platform) has been developed by the Company, which is the owner of the Platform. Development of the Platform began in 2016, and has now been completed, subject to further improvements.

The Platform provides an innovative Bitcoin rewards ecosystem. It transforms the traditional concept of ecommerce, or commerce in general, into a concept of a cooperative society where both merchants and consumers are collaborating and Bitcoin will serve as the reward system, to acknowledge the value created by the consumers for their contribution. The ecosystem provides consumers with rewards each time they complete a challenge defined by a merchant. This is intended to make the ecommerce process beneficial to everyone, and to help distribute commercial wealth among and between the merchants and consumers. 

The Platform currently offers advertising and market research application, online product sales application, offline product sales application, online service sales application, offline service sales application, online game sales application and Online game application. Among these, online and offline product and service sales applications allow consumers to purchase goods and services from various merchants on the Platform, and allow merchants to market their products and services using Bitcoin as rewards. Consumers can also participate in advertising and market research programs to earn Bitcoin. In addition, the Platform provides a large number of games, and game players are able to earn Bitcoin as they purchase in-game credits on the Platform.

The Merchant Platform enables the creation of white-labeled versions of the applications that can be used by small- or mid-sized groups of merchants to leverage the Bitcoin rewards ecosystem. Wewards, as the technology provider, will work with different white-labeled merchants and operators to customize their needs. 

The Company has previously engaged unaffiliated technology services providers to develop the Platforms ecosystem, and to work with white-labeled merchants and operators for customized versions of the Platform. The first white-labeled operator (the Operator), an unaffiliated Cayman Islands based company, will be engaged by the Company to operate the Merchant Platform in Greater China area. The Company intends to enter into a license agreement with this first Operator by the end of calendar 2019. The license agreement is intended to enable the Operator to brand the Platform with customized features. As of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has not secured any revenue from the Platform.

The Company believes that the Platforms ecosystem will benefit merchants and consumers as follows:

·
 Merchants, by enrolling their business into the ecosystem, will be able to attract more consumers to buy their products or services. This is especially important for small, local businesses that do not have large and pooled marketing budgets
 ·
 Consumers that use the ecosystem and shop from the merchants that are enrolled in the ecosystem will receive Bitcoin rewards for every purchase they make. 
 ·
 The ecosystem will enable better market targeting by allowing the merchants to adjust the size of the reward based on the product or service offered, store location, season, time of day, and other parameters.
 ·
 Consumers and Merchants will be able to earn additional rewards by introducing new consumers and merchants to the platform.
 ·
 Unlike other reward or loyalty programs, our rewards are issued in the form of Bitcoin. This ensures that all rewards have true market values.

Merchants will be required to buy Bitcoin externally and deposit them into the ecosystem to serve as rewards to consumers. Alternatively, operators can deposit and distribute Bitcoin as rewards to consumers on behalf of merchants based on real consumptions.

Recent Development

In connection with the preparation of the Annual Report for the previous fiscal year, ended May 31, 2018, the Company completed its internal investigation and collected enough evidence to believe that the Company's former accountant, who had access to the Company's bank account, is the suspect for two fraudulent wire transfers that occurred in July 2017 and October 2017. Both payments were sent to an unknown company; each payment was $248,000, totaling $496,000.

The Companys investigation discovered that the former accountant prepared false invoices, sent two unauthorized wire transfers, and falsified bank statements showing transfers were made to a known vendor. She then sent false bank statements and invoices to the Company's outside accountant, who prepared the Company's financial statements. The fraud was discovered when the vendor couldn't match its accounting records with the audit request from the Company's auditor.

On September 13, 2018, the police department in Arcadia, California was notified and a police report was filed. The Companys CEO, Lei Pei, also met with the Companys local bank branch manager, and was told that the bank is not responsible for any fraudulent activities that occurred over 60 days ago. Both the Company and the bank are continuing the investigation, with the intent of bringing the perpetrator to justice, and hopefully retrieving the fraudulently diverted funds.

The Company believes that the investigation is continuing. To the Companys knowledge the former accountant was arrested and released, and the fraudulently transferred funds are in the process of being recovered. Notwithstanding, the Company remains solvent, and is paying its obligations on a timely basis.
