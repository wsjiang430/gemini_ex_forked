ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Vision
To be the global leader in fashion for the next generation of consumers through a portfolio of the most innovative brands.
Who We Are
a.k.a. Brands (“a.k.a.”) is an accelerator of fashion brands for the next generation. We target and acquire high-potential brands that we believe are at a pivotal point in their growth trajectory that we can integrate into our operating model and accelerate their growth. Leveraging our proven track record, industry expertise and operational synergies, we believe our brands can grow faster, reach broader audiences, achieve greater scale and enhance their profitability. We believe we are disrupting the status quo and pioneering a new approach to fashion.
Through our portfolio of next-generation global brands, we reach a broad audience across accessible price points and varied styles. Our current brands share a common focus on Millennial and Gen Z consumers who seek fashion inspiration on social media and primarily shop online. Nimble by design, our innovative brands are customer-centric and have authentic and engaging relationships with their target audiences through highly relevant social content and other digital marketing strategies. Leveraging innovative, data-driven insights, our brands introduce fresh content and high-quality merchandise daily. Our operating model accelerates the growth and profitability of our existing brands, and we aim to continue expanding our portfolio. Simply put, our brands are better together.
We believe we are differentiated by our ability to attract and retain a wide range of Millennial and Gen Z consumers through authentic brand messaging and curated, on-trend fashion. In 2022, across a.k.a. Brands, we grew our active customer base by 2.7% from 2021, who placed 13.8% more orders compared to 2021, and had a low sales return ratio of approximately 16.6% of net sales.
We believe our robust growth and profitability validate our business approach and asset-light business model. We achieved $611.7 million in net sales and adjusted EBITDA of $31.9 million in 2022.
Our Brands
a.k.a. Brands currently consists of four brands: two women’s brands, Princess Polly and Petal & Pup, and two streetwear brands, Culture Kings and mnml. The Company owned Rebdolls, a brand that the Company purchased in December 2019, throughout all of 2022, but subsequently sold in February 2023 back to its founder. While the Company believed in Rebdolls’ long-term success, the brand was below the scale that would allow it to experience the full potential of the a.k.a. Brands platform.
Princess Polly
Founded in Australia in 2010, Princess Polly joined a.k.a. Brands in July 2018. With a tagline of “Wear It This Weekend,” Princess Polly focuses on providing fun dresses, tops, shoes and accessories with body-confident and trendy fashion designs. The brand operates predominantly online and targets female customers between the ages of 15 and 25, who value the brand’s high quality assortment, compelling price points and free and fast shipping. Princess Polly customers are inspired by the brands’ constant stream of inspirational social media content and the fresh, new and affordable merchandise arriving daily. Since joining a.k.a. Brands, Princess Polly has experienced rapid growth and increasing brand awareness in the United States.
Petal & Pup
Founded in Australia in 2015, Petal & Pup joined a.k.a. Brands in August 2019. The brand operates exclusively online and offers an assortment of trendy, flattering, feminine styles and dresses for special occasions. The brand targets female customers typically in their twenties or thirties, with more than 70% of customers between the ages of 25 and 34. In 2019, Petal & Pup expanded to the United States, which is now its fastest growing geography.
Culture Kings
Founded in Australia in 2008, Culture Kings joined a.k.a. Brands in March 2021. Culture Kings is a premium multi-channel retailer of streetwear apparel, footwear, headwear and accessories. The brand offers its customers a curated assortment from over one hundred leading third-party streetwear brands, as well as a large and growing portfolio of in-house designed brands and exclusive products that embody the relationship between music, sports, art and fashion. The brand targets male consumers between the ages of 18 and 35 who are fashion conscious, highly social and digitally focused. More than 50% of Culture Kings’ products are exclusive and approximately 76% of its sales are made online. Culture Kings engages with customers through a combination of compelling online and offline marketing strategies that leverage the latest in music, fashion, art and celebrities to create brand hype and product excitement.
The brand operates eight experiential concept stores in major cities in Australia and New Zealand, and opened its first U.S. store in Las Vegas in November 2022. These stores serve as a powerful customer acquisition tool, and provide customers a unique and immersive brand experience. The stores feature engaging in-store designs and product displays, storefronts designed by best-in-class graffiti artists, exclusive product releases including promotional products only available in-store and event-driven in-store activations. The stores host a variety of public events and creative activities designed to instill feelings and emotions of excitement such as sneaker vending machines, basketball shooting competitions, live DJ sessions and appearances of global celebrities and tastemakers, including athletes and on-trend music artists. The brand creates digital content based on the events and activities in-store and publishes them online, generating further hype on social media. The unique in-store experience generates excitement and anticipation, driving demand and traffic online and offline, and creating customer affiliation with the Culture Kings brands, not just the products sold.
mnml
Founded in Los Angeles in 2016, mnml joined a.k.a. Brands in October 2021. mnml is a men’s streetwear brand that designs premier, fashion forward apparel, with an emphasis on bottoms, at affordable prices. As an early mover in the direct-to-consumer streetwear segment, mnml has created powerful brand recognition and is an established destination for modern wardrobe staples, current trends and highly sought-after styles. The brand has developed a data-driven merchandising model to bring quality, on-trend fashion to customers faster and at an accessible price point. mnml’s authentic social media marketing strategy, highlighted by its more than one million followers across social platforms, drives efficient customer acquisition and strong brand loyalty. In 2022, Culture Kings began to sell mnml on Culture Kings’ website and in their stores in Australia and the U.S.
Our Operating Model
Data-Driven Merchandising with High Penetration of Exclusive High-Quality Fashion
Our brands aim to deliver constant newness and excitement by creating and curating on-trend and affordable fashion. We utilize real-time data and consumer insights to identify the latest trends and work with our global sourcing network to quickly bring new, high-quality products to market. Our women’s brands merchandise is purchased using our agile “test-and-repeat” merchandising model, which enables us to quickly react to customer demand and test product appeal without taking large initial inventory positions, yet still capture in-season demand. This model ensures that our merchandise is always on-trend and customer-led, with minimal inventory risk because we only replenish the styles that our customers show us that they like.
Our brands’ compelling merchandising strategy is anchored by a high proportion of exclusive styles that cannot be found elsewhere. Our women’s brands sell mostly exclusive styles and the majority of our streetwear styles are either exclusive in-house designed Culture Kings brands or exclusive styles from leading third party brands. Our customers’ satisfaction with the fit, quality, affordability and exclusivity of our styles is further reflected in our sales return rates across our brands, which was well below industry average in 2022 at approximately 16.6% of net sales.
We Efficiently Acquire Customers Through Authentic Content and Innovative, Measurable Marketing
Our brands engage with customers by releasing a stream of inspiring digital content at high frequency across multiple channels where we know our customers are. We believe our content-rich narrative and authentic brand messaging drives organic traffic to our websites, efficiently generating demand, enhancing connectivity with customers and amplifying our brand communities. Our brands constantly innovate their marketing strategies and reach their customers organically across all channels including social media, paid performance and innovative in-house channels. Core to our marketing strategy is the use of social media influencers, and we maintain relationships with approximately 25,000 influencers globally and utilize them to test and launch new products, gather customer feedback, increase brand awareness and acquire new customers in a cost-effective manner. In 2022, across a.k.a. Brands, we had nearly 10.0 million followers on social media and served more than 3.8 million active customers. In addition to social media marketing, we also tested live video shopping events and increased our penetration of SMS text message marketing in 2022.
Our Operating Model Creates Value by Driving Synergies Across the Portfolio
Our brands operate independently but have access to resources, guidance and vendors at the a.k.a. Brands level. We believe this model balances scale-enabled cost savings with operational flexibility, facilitates low-risk innovation and accommodates the needs of our brands at various stages of growth. Our operating model is designed to provide collective advantages and accelerate profitable growth in both existing and new markets and allows us to manage the brands at a portfolio level.
Flexible Technology Stack and Operations
Our brands leverage a broad network of third-party service and technology providers, which allows us to implement the latest capabilities with limited upfront investment and quickly adopt innovations in the market. We utilize a combination of owned and third-party logistics and fulfillment assets and third-party technology partners, creating flexibility to support our high-growth brands with fast and efficient fulfillment and shipping. We customize our approach for each brand to allow for optimization and tailored growth tools, which sets us apart from other centralized platforms. For example, while we maintain a network of proven vendors across the portfolio, we allow our brands to take a custom approach to which vendors they use. Therefore, there is minimal operational disruption when we acquire new brands given our flexible operations approach. Additionally, given our scale, we negotiate favorable rates with our vendors, providing our brands with attractive terms and enhancing overall profitability.
Deep Industry Expertise
Our brands have access to our highly-skilled leadership team, each of whom has a proven track-record and years of experience building and scaling successful eCommerce businesses. We have deep expertise in the business of fashion, and we support our brands so they can focus on customer-facing priorities such as branding, merchandising and maintaining an authentic connection with customers.
Innovation Hub and Knowledge Sharing
We enable and encourage a network of cross-brand learnings to advance innovation and promote best practices – what accelerates profitable growth for one brand can accelerate profitable growth for others. Across our brands, we test and learn digital innovation and facilitate knowledge sharing and benchmarking of key performance metrics to improve growth, operational efficiency and profitability.
We Promote Diversity and Practice Responsible Fashion
Our brands reflect the diversity and beauty of our customers and we continuously seek ways to expand the diversity in our brands, products and marketing. We believe diversity and sustainability align with our core values and drive better results. We operate responsibly and are committed to responsible fashion and sustainability through prioritization of transparency, fair labor practices and reduced waste.
Our Growth Strategies
We believe our global next-generation fashion brands are disrupting categories with strong fundamental growth and capitalizing on long-term global secular tailwinds. We intend to execute the following strategies to expand our business and gain market share:
Grow Our Brands Organically in Our Existing Markets and Channels
Grow Brand Awareness and Acquire New Customers Through Omni-Channel Expansion
We believe our brands are underpenetrated in the markets in which they operate. We think there is a significant opportunity to grow awareness of our brands due to the continued secular shift to eCommerce, as well as the strength of our data-driven marketing model. We intend to efficiently acquire new customers through continued investment in our content creation and social media capabilities, as well as through our network of approximately 25,000 influencers. Through continued investment in these initiatives, we believe we will be able to further appeal to our core demographic of Millennial and Gen Z consumers and increase our market share.
While our brands primarily operate direct to consumer and are digitally native, to further build brand awareness, we expect to test select omnichannel experiences in 2023. We recently announced that we expect to partner on select wholesale engagements to expand our brands’ visibility in key retailers that we know our customers love. We also believe that stores are important drivers of brand awareness given the success of the experiential Culture Kings stores in Australia, New Zealand and Las Vegas, and we recently committed to opening a Princess Polly store in 2023 to further build brand awareness. We believe we are building stores of the future that are experiential in nature and bring the brand to life through events and in-store activations.
Expand Product Categories and Offerings
We believe our brands are well positioned to grow by expanding product styles and entering new categories that are complementary to our brands’ current offerings. Our brands aim to identify trends and evaluate opportunities leveraging digital capabilities, data-driven insights and a test-and-repeat merchandising model. We believe our brands have a significant opportunity to expand product ranges, increase average order value and broaden customer reach. For example, Princess Polly launched their extended size collection, Curve, and expanded upon their sustainably-made Low Impact assortment in 2022. Additionally, in December of 2021, we acquired a print shop in California to create exclusive printed tees for our brands. In 2022, Culture Kings expanded their licensed business of printed tees and Princess Polly and mnml recently began using the facility to create printed tees. We intend to continue to increase our mix of owned brands and exclusive offerings, which we believe generate higher margins and drive traffic to our websites.
Increase Loyalty and Wallet Share
We intend to deepen customer relationships to improve customer retention and increase wallet share. We aim to achieve this by enhancing our user experience, improving engagement, refining our customer segmentation, increasing personalization, launching loyalty programs across our brands and constantly introducing new styles, designer collaborations and exclusive items. Our authentic content and steady stream of new styles encourages deep connections with new and existing customers, resulting in an attractive customer lifetime value.
Grow Internationally
We intend to leverage the strength of our brands and our ability to connect with customers to expand into new international markets beyond our core U.S. and Australian markets. Net sales to customers outside of the U.S. and Australia was $71.8 million across 184 countries and territories and represented 12% of total sales in 2022.
We will continue to target markets that demonstrate strong social and digital media usage. As part of our long-term strategy, we have identified several markets in which we believe we can introduce one or more of our brands in the future, such as expanding Culture Kings in Korea and Japan and Princess Polly in Canada, Europe and the U.K. Additionally, we plan to enter into key markets through strategic wholesale partnerships. We believe our experience growing the Princess Polly and Petal & Pup brands in the U.S. creates a proven roadmap to help us introduce our brands globally.
Grow Through Acquisitions
We employ a corporate development team dedicated to the identification, evaluation and acquisition of brands, and we maintain a strong pipeline of potential targets which typically includes multiple acquisition opportunities at differing stages of evaluation.
We seek next-generation brands with strong customer followings and a proven track record of operating profitably but need help scaling to further accelerate their growth. We look for talented and passionate teams who have proven abilities to leverage data, technology and content to grow. We seek asset-light brands that have the potential to benefit from the a.k.a. expertise and resources. We look for brands with similar operating and financial characteristics as our existing brands. We are continuously evaluating opportunities for such acquisitions.
Continue to Drive Efficiencies
As we continue to scale organically and through acquisitions, we aim to improve operational performance across our portfolio and enhance profitability. We will also look for ways to reduce our input costs by leveraging our collective scale to negotiate improved terms with suppliers and vendors, including for raw materials, freight and shipping. As our brands grow and gain scale, we intend to invest in automation and process improvement within our operations to drive lower variable costs and improved profitability.
Our Industry
We primarily operate in the large and growing global apparel, footwear and accessories industry. According to Statista, a platform specialized in market and consumer data, the global apparel market grew to $1.5 trillion in 2021 and the global footwear market was valued at $382 billion in 2022. Although 2021 and 2022 retail sales were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and macro-economic factors, the global apparel and footwear market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.8% between 2023 to 2028. Though we ship our products globally, we operate primarily in two geographies: the U.S. and Australia. The U.S. had the largest apparel market of any country, expecting to grow to an estimated $343 billion in 2023 and grow at a 2.0% CAGR from 2023 to 2027. The Australian apparel market is expecting to grow to an estimated $20 billion in 2023 and grow at a 2.0% CAGR from 2023 to 2027. We believe the key factors driving growth within the global apparel, footwear and accessories industry include favorable demographic trends and desire for constant newness.
Apparel, Footwear and Accessories Shopping Has Been Growing Online
Consumers are increasingly turning to online channels to make purchases, driven by the growing Millennial and Gen Z populations and the increasing influence of social and digital media channels. According to BigCommerce, the U.S. online apparel, footwear and accessories market was valued at approximately $180 billion in 2021, and is expected to have reached $205 billion in 2022.
Digital-Savvy Millennial and Gen Z Consumers Seeking the Next-Generation Shopping Experience
According to data from the United Nations, Millennial and Gen Z consumers, our primary target demographic today, account for 23% and 32% of the global population, respectively, making them a large and growing demographic group with significant economic influence. In addition, in the U.S., a content consumption study found that Millennials are the biggest users of social media with as many as 84% using at least one social network, while Gen Z consumers are the most digitally native with 98% of them owning a smartphone and spending an average of four hours on apps each day.
Technology Infrastructure
Our brands are built on a modern, flexible and scalable technology infrastructure which leverages a broad network of best-in-class, third-party technology providers. We then combine that customized presentation layer with the backend engine from Shopify, which is a proven and industry leading eCommerce solution. By pairing our own in-house technology with cloud software, we have been able to create a differentiated user experience that we can adjust as necessary while also leveraging engineering talent from some of the best SaaS companies in the world to scale rapidly and efficiently. Our cloud-based, SaaS native strategy allows us to adopt innovative, dynamic technology and capabilities with limited upfront investment and nimbly adopt market-leading technologies as they are introduced. We consider this to be a key differentiating factor compared to traditional retail proprietary technology stacks and for which switching to a more agile cloud-based SaaS solution could be too costly and risky.
Our technology infrastructure integrates seamlessly across our organization, connecting in a way that allows constant iteration and improvement. We leverage highly customizable solutions to provide customers optimal improved experiences, while limiting the costs and time required of custom bespoke solutions. This approach allows us to easily test new capabilities on a limited and low-cost basis, analyze and learn from the results, and then roll out more broadly if successful. We are leveraging our technology infrastructure to accelerate our scale and growth and drive efficiencies in areas spanning marketing, merchandising, customer experience, supply chain, operations and administration.
Sourcing
We source our products from a network of international suppliers. Our supplier base included 311 suppliers across 10 different countries as of December 31, 2022.
We have strong long-term relationships with our manufacturers, but we do not have any long-term commitments requiring us to purchase minimum volumes from any supplier or manufacturer. We seek to leverage our collective scale and use the same suppliers for our brands, where possible, in order to obtain more favorable terms from our suppliers. Our network of third party suppliers allows us to be capital efficient and nimble, giving us the ability to move new designs we receive from our suppliers into production and then into inventory in as few as 30 to 45 days for the majority of our inventory, as compared to up to nine months for traditional apparel brands.
We strategically establish sourcing relationships to ensure a constant supply of high quality, low cost inventory with a number of our suppliers exclusively manufacturing for our brands. Although we have our own design team, a number of suppliers have the capability to produce concepts and designs with no obligation for our brands to purchase. With less seasonal demand for our products, we offer our manufacturing partners predictable and consistent growth in inventory purchases throughout the year.
People & Culture
We promote a holistic approach to building our team and have created a culture that is inclusive, diverse and high performing. We seek out and hire team members who bring specialized, functional expertise while able to collaborate effectively across brands, functions and geographies. Our culture is fast-paced, promotes accountability, empowers team members to drive the business forward daily, stresses a bias toward action and embraces the individuality of each team member.
Attracting, motivating and retaining passionate talent at all levels is vital to continuing our success. We actively look for talented people across multiple geographies and promote a “work from anywhere” approach, which allows us to maintain a lean physical footprint and employ offices as team collaboration hubs. We continuously work to improve the team member experience to drive retention and engagement. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. While each of our brands celebrates its own unique culture and brand values, we collectively embrace a next-generation mindset:
•We are customer-led; focusing relentlessly on delivering a high-quality customer experience,
•We move fast; executing on innovative ideas swiftly,
•We are data driven; using data and analytics to make smarter decisions every day,
•We are growth minded; testing and learning continuously in and across our brands,
•We are diverse; celebrating and expanding the diversity of our customers and teams,
•We act with integrity and practice responsible fashion; when in doubt, we resort to the high standard.
As of December 31, 2022, across a.k.a. Brands, we had more than 1,000 full- and part-time employees. The majority of our workforce is located in Australia, with the remaining employees located throughout the United States. On a limited basis, we may use temporary personnel to supplement our workforce as business needs arise.
Sustainability and Responsible Fashion
a.k.a. Brands promotes sustainable, responsible and inclusive fashion and does so by focusing on four key areas: ethical sourcing, sustainability, environment and equality & community.
Ethical Sourcing
We aim to promote a safe and respectful environment for workers who make our products and protect their human rights. For example, in 2022, Princess Polly maintained valid ethical manufacturing audits for 100% of final stage production, or tier one production, and packaging production sites, while completing the tracing of 100% of their suppliers, or tier two supply chain. With global traveling reopening, Princess Polly was able to visit a significant number of sites in India and China, while also engaging an on-ground ethical sourcing resource in China. The suite of tools to support factory managers and empower workers has also been improved, piloting e-learning for managers and grievance hotlines accessible to workers. Princess Polly is the leader on ethical sourcing in our portfolio and amongst their digitally native brand peers, and we will leverage their best practices and apply them to the rest of our portfolio. We are devoted to making continual progress towards our commitments and being transparent along the way.
Sustainability
We are making on-trend fashion more sustainable and accessible to everyone by transitioning our products to be made with lower environmental impact. Presently, 20% of Princess Polly’s product range is made from verified lower-impact materials, including organic, recycled, water-based or forest-friendly alternatives to conventional materials. Princess Polly has also introduced recycled nylon basics and recycled sequin party styles. We are aiming to have over 40% of our products made with lower-impact materials by the end of 2023.
Environment
We are committed to protecting the planet by promoting circularity and improving the environmental impact of our packaging, business operations and factories. Our business model limits the planetary burden of overproduction. Our real-time, demand-driven and automated ordering system allows production to track demand as accurately as possible. This high velocity, low waste strategy allows us to avoid unnecessary production. As members of the United Nations Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, Princess Polly committed to setting science-based targets inline with a 1.5 degree temperature rise. Princess Polly also reduced the absolute impact of their upstream transport by 41% from 2021, and offset all emissions from global facilities. Princess Polly is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2030.
Equality & Community
We are committed to instilling an inclusive culture and promoting diversity across our brands. As such, we aim to represent the diversity of our customers in our marketing and offer the right product to serve their unique demand. Our brands Culture Kings and mnml both address men’s fashion, both of which are traditionally underserved yet fast-growing markets. 56% of Culture Kings’ customers are men.
Competition
The online and offline retail markets generally are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. We face significant competition from eCommerce websites, including apparel- and accessories-oriented eCommerce websites as well as the eCommerce websites of traditional retailers. We also face competition from direct-from-manufacturer retailers and in-person stores and boutiques, including traditional retailers and fashion boutiques.
We compete based on product selection, differentiation, exclusivity, brand quality and strength of customer relationships, relevance, convenience, ease of use and consumer experience, including order fulfillment and shipping timelines. We believe we compete favorably across these factors taken as a whole.
Seasonality
Historically, we have achieved our largest quarterly revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter. However, as our expansion into the U.S. market continues, our quarterly revenues are less concentrated in the fourth fiscal quarter. In fiscal year 2022, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 24%, 26%, 25% and 24%, respectively, of our total net sales for the year. In fiscal year 2021, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 12%, 27%, 29% and 32%, respectively, of our total net sales for the year.
Intellectual Property
We primarily protect our intellectual property through the trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of Australia and the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we owned approximately 496 trademark registration and approximately 83 Internet domain names. Although we have not sought copyright registration for our technology or works to date, we rely on common law copyright and trade secret protections in relation to our proprietary technology, products and the content displayed on our websites, including our photography and fabric prints that we design. Our trademarks, including domain names, are material to our business and brand identity.
In addition to the protections provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. We further control the use of our technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our client terms of use on our website and in our vendor terms and conditions.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations include federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union), which address, among other things, the processing of payments, privacy, data protection, information security, sending of commercial email and other laws regarding unfair and deceptive trade practices. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the accessibility of our websites, including under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Our business is also subject to additional laws and regulations, including restrictions on imports from, exports to, and services provided to persons located in certain countries and territories, as well as foreign laws and regulations addressing topics such as advertising and marketing practices, customs duties and taxes and consumer rights, any of which might apply by virtue of our operations in foreign countries and territories or our contacts with consumers in such foreign countries and territories.
In addition, apparel, shoes and accessories sold by us are also subject to regulation by governmental agencies in Australia, New Zealand and the United States, as well as various other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations principally relate to the materials, proper labeling, advertising, marketing, manufacture, licensing requirements, flammability testing, safety, shipment and disposal of our products. We are also subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to the operations of our stores and warehouses.
We are also subject to environmental laws, rules and regulations. Similarly, apparel, shoes and accessories sold by us are also subject to import regulations in the United States and other countries concerning the use of wildlife products for commercial and non-commercial trade. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current fiscal year or in the near future.
For more information about laws and regulations applicable to our business, see “Risk Factors–Risks Relating to Laws and Regulation.”
