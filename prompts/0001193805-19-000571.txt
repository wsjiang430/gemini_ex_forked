ITEM 1. Business. 
Overview Description of Business
 
We are currently a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company. We no longer have any full-time employees and our principal executive and financial officers serve on a part-time consulting basis.
 
Prior to March 2003, our business had been focused on pre-revenue development and commercialization of disposable medical devices designed to enhance the effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging in detection and diagnosis of heart disease. Due to the unavailability of funding, beginning in the Fall of 2002 we essentially ceased all of our operations including product development and commercialization activities. Our efforts to realize value for our prior business and MRI technology have been unsuccessful. As a result, we view our most viable option to be merging with an unrelated operating company that could benefit from our status as a reporting company in a so-called “reverse merger” transaction. Entering into a “reverse merger” would likely involve very substantial dilution to the existing shareholders (see also below regarding funding provided to the Company by MALLC, defined below). It would, however, provide an opportunity to return some value to shareholders. While we have identified and explored merging with a number of candidates over the past few years we have no commitments to merge with any company at the present time.
 
In November 2006 the shareholders of the Company approved a 1 for 100 reverse stock split of our common stock. On March 1, 2007, such reverse stock split became effective. Fractional shares were rounded up to the next full share.
 
In order to raise cash to continue our efforts to pursue a reverse merger, on October 31, 2005, the Company consummated a stock purchase agreement with Magna Acquisition LLC (“MALLC”) which resulted in a change of control of our company. Under the agreement, we sold 300,000 shares of Class A Common Stock to MALLC for gross proceeds of $190,000, before expenses. Contemporaneous with and as a condition to the investment, MALLC purchased from our former principal stockholder, Noga Investments in Technology, Ltd. (“Noga”), a company in receivership, 307,727 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, representing all the shares of our common stock owned by that shareholder. Two of our directors and our Treasurer and Secretary (“Chief Financial Officer”) serve as sole managers of MALLC, with the ability to vote and dispose of the shares of our Company owned by MALLC by majority vote. These directors have assumed a lead role with management in pursuing financing and merger candidates and operating matters.
 
Our principal shareholder, MALLC has been responsible for substantially all of our funding since October 31, 2005 through the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. Through the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, MALLC loaned us an aggregate $687,250 under a series of promissory notes. Such notes are unsecured and mature by their terms 120 days from issuance. At February 28, 2019, $679,650 face amount of such notes were beyond their maturity date and therefore due on demand. The notes bear interest at 12% per year increasing to 15% per year for periods beyond maturity.

Subsequent to February 28, 2019 on May 20,, 2019, a director of the Company who is also the managing member of MALLC loaned us approximately $10,000 on the same terms as the notes payable to MALLC except that the interest rate was reduced to 10% initially and increases to 12% upon default.
 
The Company intends to make a proposal to MALLC and to the director who loaned money to the Company in May 2019 to convert all amounts outstanding to them (including overdue amounts) into common stock of the Company. The settlement of debt with common stock of the Company is likely to result in very substantial dilution to the existing shareholders. See Item 12. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.
 
While we have reduced our expenditures very significantly, we do not have sufficient cash to continue our activities for the coming twelve months. We currently do not have any commitments for new funding.
 
Historical Activities
 
We developed two products, Illuminator ProbeÔ and Illuminator Surface Coil,Ô that were intended to provide a non-invasive means for imaging the heart in conjunction with existing MRI systems. These products were approved for marketing by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in 2001 based on animal studies. Since that time and until 2002, we devoted significant resources to performing additional development and clinical work necessary to support acceptance of such products in the marketplace. Prior to completion of such activities, we encountered cash constraints and were not able to raise the necessary capital to fund these activities. Our development and marketing activities were funded by approximately $10 million of private equity received during the three fiscal years ended February 28, 2002, approximately 75% of which came from Noga Investments in Technology, Ltd (“Noga”) who then became our principal shareholder. In late 2002 and early 2003, we learned that Noga had been placed in receivership and had no ability to provide anticipated further funding. Later in 2003, we learned that Noga was being liquidated.
 
As a result of our cash constraints at that time, beginning in the Fall of 2002, we began to scale back our operations and reduce our infrastructure costs. Once we completed an in-process clinical imaging milestone in the Fall of 2002, we terminated all non-executive personnel, vacated our office in Lynnfield, MA (leaving a significant liability for the remaining term of the lease which was later settled in November 2003) and ceased substantially all development and commercialization activities. During this time, our executive officers and Board first deferred significant portions of their compensation (aggregating approximately $113,000 which was settled with stock in 2005) and in January 2003 agreed to substantially reduce or eliminate their compensation going forward. The Company’s then Chief Executive Officer agreed to voluntarily resign and was retained on a per diem basis as Acting Chief Executive Officer until his resignation from that position effective May 2004. Dr. Minkoff, our Chairman and President, assumed the responsibilities of principal executive officer of the Company at that time.
 
Prior to 1997, our efforts had been focused on development and commercialization of anatomy specific MRI scanners. Due to a lack of sufficient sales of the scanner, in February 1997 we made a strategic decision to refocus our efforts to the cardiac medical device line of business described above.
 
Through assignment and license, we acquired all of the commercial rights to U.S. and certain corresponding foreign patents relating to our MRI technologies. See Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding payments advanced by Dr. Minkoff, which payments ceased in 2007, in an attempt to preserve such proprietary rights which the Company can no longer pay (see also Item 12. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions). As such, we have been unable to continue to preserve any of these patent rights and we currently believe that the underlying intellectual property became compromised and will not generate any value for the Company.
 
In January 2017, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the Company. Under the Purchase Agreement, the CEO purchased all of the intellectual property rights, any and all physical assets, any and all permits and all non-financial books, records, files, design specification, software and other data related to the Company’s magnetic resonance imaging technology. In exchange for purchased assets, the CEO (a) assumed all liabilities of the Company related exclusively to the purchased assets and (b) agreed to forgiveness of all indebtedness owing from the Company totaling approximately $110,000.

On March 1, 2007, we effected a 1 for 100 reverse stock split of our common stock. All share references herein give retroactive effect to the reverse split.
 
We were incorporated as a New York corporation on February 22, 1991 and commenced operations on February 10, 1992. We completed our initial public offering in a firm commitment underwriting in 1993, at which time our class A common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market. We were delisted from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market in 1997 for failure to meet the quantitative continued listing criteria. In 1998 we were relisted on the Nasdaq SmallCap until 1999 when we were again delisted for failure to meet the quantitative continued listing criteria, and trading commenced on the NASD Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board and subsequently on the OTCQB. We have one subsidiary, Cardiac MRI, Inc., a wholly owned New York corporation formed by us in December 1997. Our principal executive office is located at 1662 Old Country Road, # 355, Plainview, NY 11803 and our telephone number is in care of (301) 972 5232.
 
A more complete description of the historical activities of the Company is contained in Item 1. Business contained in our Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2004.
