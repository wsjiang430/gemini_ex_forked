ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of Business
Townsquare Media, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, except as the context may otherwise require, "we," "us," "our," "Company," or "Townsquare") is a radio, digital media, entertainment and digital marketing solutions company principally focused on being the premier local advertising and marketing solutions platform in small and mid-sized markets across the United States.  Our assets include 321 radio stations and more than 330 local websites in 67 U.S. markets, a digital marketing solutions company (Townsquare Interactive) serving approximately 15,350 small to medium sized businesses, a proprietary digital programmatic advertising platform (Townsquare Ignite), and approximately 200 live events with over one million attendees each year. Our brands include local media assets such as WYRK, KLAQ, K2 and NJ101.5; iconic regional and national events such as the Taste of Country Music Festival, WE Fest, Country Jam, the Boise Music Festival, the Red Dirt BBQ & Music Festival and Taste of Fort Collins; and leading tastemaker music and entertainment websites such as XXLmag.com, TasteofCountry.com and Loudwire.com.
Format of Presentation
Townsquare is a radio, digital media, entertainment and digital marketing solutions company principally focused on being the premier local advertising and marketing solutions platform in small and mid-sized markets across the United States. Our assets include market leading radio stations, digital, mobile, video and social media properties, and live events. Our integrated and diversified product and service offerings, which we refer to as Townsquare Everywhere, enable local, regional and national advertisers to target audience engagement across multiple platforms, including on-air, online and at live events. We believe our Townsquare Everywhere capabilities, combined with our leading market position in small and mid-sized markets, enable us to generate higher total net revenue per audience member than radio station owners focused on larger markets.
Townsquare owns and operates 321 radio stations and over 330 local websites serving 67 small and mid-sized markets, a digital marketing solutions company Townsquare Interactive, a digital programmatic advertising platform Townsquare Ignite and an e-commerce offering. Almost all of our radio stations have local companion websites that utilize the station brands and are populated with proprietary, original content created or curated by our local media personalities. In addition, Townsquare owns and operates a diverse range of live events which we create, promote and produce. This includes festivals, concerts, expositions and other experiential events within and beyond our markets. 
Our primary sources of net revenue are the sale of advertising on our radio stations, owned and operated websites, radio stations’ online streams and mobile applications. Our sales of advertisements are primarily affected by the demand for advertising from local, regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates we charge. Advertising demand and rates are based primarily on our ability to attract audiences to our various products in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers, as measured principally by various services on a periodic basis. We endeavor to develop strong audience loyalty and believe that the diversification of formats on our radio stations and websites helps to insulate our radio stations and websites from the effects of changes in musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format. We believe that the sale of our online and mobile advertisements, which currently have rates per advertisement that are less than those of terrestrial radio advertisements, has not negatively impacted our terrestrial radio advertising net revenue. Should a significant and sudden shift in demand for these products toward online and mobile occur, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to increase rates accordingly. However, we believe that as a result of our strong brands and quality online and mobile offerings we are well positioned to increase rates as demand increases for these products.
In addition, we offer precision customer targeting solutions to advertisers through Townsquare Ignite, our digital programmatic advertising platform. Combining first and third party audience and geographic location data, Ignite is able to hyper-target audiences for our local, regional and national advertisers, providing them the ability to reach a high percentage of their online audience. Ignite delivers these solutions across desktop, mobile, connected TV, email, paid search and social media platforms utilizing display, video and native executions. 
We also offer digital marketing solutions through Townsquare Interactive, on a subscription basis, to small and mid-sized local and regional businesses in small and mid-sized markets across the United States, including the markets in 
which we operate radio stations. Our digital marketing solutions, include traditional and mobile-enabled website development and hosting services, e-commerce platforms, search engine and online directory optimization services, online reputation management, social media management and website retargeting.
Our primary source of live events net revenue is ticket sales. Our live events also generate substantial net revenue through the sale of sponsorships, food and other concessions, merchandise and other ancillary products and services. Live event ticket pricing is based on consumer demand for each event and the geographic location and target audience demographic of each event. Unforeseen events such as inclement weather conditions can have an adverse impact on our net revenue. In certain cases, we mitigate this risk with insurance policies, which cover a portion of lost revenue as a result of unforeseen events including inclement weather.
We strive to maximize our net revenue by managing our advertising inventory and adjusting prices based on supply and demand and by broadening our base of advertisers and subscribers. Our selling and pricing activity is based on demand for our advertising inventory and, in general, we respond to this demand by varying prices rather than by varying our target inventory levels. The optimal number of advertisements available for sale depends on the platform and in the case of our radio stations, their online streams and mobile applications, the programming format of a particular radio station. Each of our advertising products has a general target level of available inventory. We seek to broaden our base of advertisers in each of our markets by providing a wide array of audience demographic segments across our platforms, thereby providing each of our potential advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group.
Our advertising contracts are generally short-term. In the media industry, companies, including ours, sometimes utilize barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging, instead of cash.
Our most significant expenses are sales, programming, digital, marketing and promotional, engineering, and general and administrative expenses. We strive to control these expenses by closely monitoring and managing each of our local markets and through efficiencies gained from the centralization of finance, accounting, legal and human resources functions and management information systems. We also use our scale and diversified geographic portfolio to negotiate favorable rates with vendors where feasible.
A portion of our expenses are variable. These variable expenses primarily relate to sales costs, such as commissions, as well as certain programming costs, such as music license fees, and certain costs related to production. Marketing and promotions expenses are discretionary and are primarily incurred in an effort to maintain and/or increase our audience share. Other programming, digital, engineering and general and administrative expenses are primarily fixed costs. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the following competitive strengths to achieve growth in our future performance:
National Scale and Media Expertise, on a Local Level, in Small and Mid-Sized Markets.
Our scale, national reach and expertise in media and entertainment provides significant competitive advantages in our small and mid-sized markets.
Large-Market Products, Technology and Practices Deployed in Small and Mid-Sized Markets. 
Our flexible and customized content management system, digital advertising products and delivery capabilities, mobile applications, digital marketing solutions capabilities, digital programmatic advertising platform, online video content and repeatable live event templates allow us to deliver world-class products supported by advanced technology in small and mid-sized markets. We believe that with our scale we can offer superior solutions for advertisers and audiences alike as compared to many of our local competitors.
National Scale with Local Focus.
We believe we are the largest and best-capitalized owner and operator of radio stations focused solely on small and mid-sized markets in the United States. This national scale allows us to have greater relevance to, and recognition from, our advertising clients while sharing best practices for strategy and operations across our asset portfolio.
Captive Local Audience Drives Superior Opportunity in Small and Mid-Sized Markets.
The competitive and economic environments found in small and mid-sized markets, particularly the markets where we have an established presence, provide significant advantages to us and, we believe, reduce volatility in our financial results.
Attractive Competitive Landscapes. 
There are fewer and less well-capitalized, local media competitors across our small and mid-sized markets relative to larger markets. In 43 of our 67 local markets, we do not compete against any of the five largest English language national radio competitors, as measured by number of radio stations owned. We believe this competitive landscape allows our brands to gain a greater share of both audience and advertising expenditures in our markets than what is generally achieved by peers operating in large markets.
Lower Economic Volatility in Small and Mid-Sized Markets. 
Our markets have, on average, exhibited lower volatility in radio advertising spending, unemployment rates and real estate values as compared to national averages, resulting in more stable radio advertising revenue compared to the national average historically.
Strategically Assembled Market Portfolio Characterized by Stable, Locally Significant Institutions. 
We have assembled our radio station assets and most of our live events operations across a collection of small and mid-sized markets, organized in regional clusters, supported by stable, locally significant institutions such as universities, military bases, state capitals, state fairs, regional medical centers and retail hubs. We believe these stabilizing institutions further reduce the volatility of advertising spending in our markets.
#1 or #2 Revenue Market Share in Nearly All of Our Markets. 
Our brands, in the aggregate, capture the largest or the second largest radio revenue share in 65 of our 67 markets, and in 45 markets we are ranked number one. This leading market share position is indicative of our audience reach and engagement as well as our relevance to advertisers in our markets.
Strong Relationships with Local and Regional Advertisers. 
In the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated approximately 84% of our revenue from a broad array of local and regional advertisers in a number of industries, including automotive dealers, banking and mortgage service providers, furniture and home furnishings retailers, food and beverage service providers, healthcare service providers and media and telecommunications service providers. We generate a majority of our local advertising revenue by selling directly to local advertisers, as well as to local and regional advertising agencies which affords us the opportunity to better present our products to advertisers, cross-sell products and more directly influence their advertising expenditure decisions.
Geographic Diversification with Strength in Regional Clusters. 
Our assets are geographically diversified, which helps to mitigate potential regional economic volatility and inclement weather events. By clustering our markets in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, Texas and Mountain West regions we are able to create compelling audience coverage for regional advertisers and benefit from scale economies.
Diversified and Integrated Product Offering - Townsquare Everywhere.
Our diversified product offerings substantially differentiate us from our competition. This diversification allows us to provide superior solutions to both our audience and advertisers, underpins our growth strategy and, we believe, helps to mitigate the risks associated with advertising revenue concentration.
Audience Engagement In and Out-of-Home, Across Multiple Platforms. 
We offer our audience the ability to access our branded content on-air, online and on-site across multiple distribution channels. We believe that leveraging technology to make our branded content experiences accessible between devices and locations strengthens our audience engagement.
Targeted Audience Reach, Closer to the Point of Sale, to Local, Regional and National Advertisers. 
A significant portion of our audience engagement occurs when our audience is out-of-home, particularly in the car, at the workplace or at our live events. Our audience frequently interacts with our content in close proximity to purchase events.
Launch Point for Non-Radio Products. 
Our radio reach and engagement provide a powerful promotional vehicle from which we are able to grow our existing and new websites, online radio streams, mobile applications, digital marketing solutions, programmatic digital advertising platform and live events. We believe that the increased interaction with consumers across these new products and platforms in turn reinforces consumer loyalty and affinity toward our radio brands and enables us to develop and grow complementary products in our markets.
Diversified Revenue Base. 
We generate revenue from a diversified base of products and services, advertisers and markets. In the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 40% of our net revenue was derived from sources other than the sale of terrestrial radio station advertising. We refer to this revenue as non-spot revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no single advertiser represented more than 1% of our revenue, no advertising category represented more than 20% of our revenue and we did not generate more than 12% of our revenue in any one market or 13% of our revenue in any one state.
Monetization of Our Audience Relationships.
We believe that our diversified and integrated product and service offerings, which we refer to as Townsquare Everywhere, combined with our leading market position in small and mid-sized markets based on radio revenue share, together may enable us to generate higher total revenue per audience member than radio station owners focused on larger markets.
Influential Local and National Brands.
Strong Brand Recognition with Deep Local Heritage. 
We believe our brands are well positioned, both to defend their competitive position in the radio medium and to expand their competitive position online, on social media platforms, mobile devices, voice activated smart speakers, and in live events, which will allow for greater audience reach and deeper, more frequent interaction with our audience.
Original Live Event and Nationally Oriented Digital Brands Attract Significant Audience. 
In addition to our heritage brands, we established several new original brands that experienced significant audience growth since their inception and attract a large, stable and engaged audience.
Focus On Providing Original Entertainment, Music and Lifestyle Media Experiences to Our Audience.
We believe that our focus on providing original entertainment, music and lifestyle media experiences to our audience is a key driver of our powerful audience reach and engagement metrics.
Market Leadership in High-Quality, Locally-Focused Content. 
In our markets, we are among the largest providers of locally-focused content available to consumers, including in-car commuters. The quality and availability of our locally-focused content allows our brands to distinguish themselves from other local advertising offerings, attract larger audiences and build a loyal audience base. Several of our competitors, particularly in print media, are reducing the amount of original local content they are producing or creating pay-walls that restrict access to their digital content. We believe these trends will continue and will provide an advantage to our offerings as compared to other media offerings.
Expertise in Music and Entertainment. 
We believe that our expertise in the creation of music and entertainment content represents the foundation of our audience value proposition and is, in part, responsible for many of the strong metrics evidencing our broad and deep audience engagement, our ability to attract employees who excel at content production and our success with advertisers seeking to reach the valuable consumers attracted by our premium content.
Attractive Radio Industry Fundamentals.
The local media industry is an important medium for advertisers to reach targeted local consumers and for consumers to engage with relevant local content and events. Radio is a significant component of total local advertising spend as it remains a highly relevant and important medium for consumers.
Stable and Engaged Audience Base.
Despite the increased number of alternative media, terrestrial radio has experienced negligible audience fragmentation over the past 50 years and remains a significant source of daily media exposure. According to Nielsen Holdings N.V. (“Nielsen”), terrestrial radio broadcasts reached approximately 90% of American adults ages 12+ each week as of December 2018, approximately unchanged since 1970.
Cost-Effective Value Proposition to Advertisers.
Given the stability of its audience, its broad reach and its relatively low cost as compared to competing advertising media such as television, we believe radio continues to offer an attractive value proposition to advertisers. 
Trusted and Socially-Influential Local Media Personalities.
Research suggests that radio personalities are trusted by their audience and are socially influential. Six out of ten listeners in a joint Clear Channel/University of Southern California study, released in April 2014, stated that radio on-air personalities are “like a friend,” whose opinions they trust. Additionally, more than half of the study participants agreed that they trust brands, products and services recommended by their favorite on-air personality. According to Nielsen’s U.S. Music 360 Report from 2017, approximately 37% of music listeners say that one of the things they like most about listening to traditional radio is the radio personalities.
Free Delivery of Local Content to End-Users.
Terrestrial radio’s free content distribution model provides an effective competitive advantage against other mediums, particularly those that deploy a subscription-based business model or rely on costs associated with internet connectivity or bandwidth use. In most of our markets, radio represents the only local content available to consumers free of charge.
Key Provider of Safety Information and Charitable Support in the Communities We Serve.
Our radio stations and local websites, together with our employees, play a vital role in the communities we serve by providing emergency information in times of crisis and by supporting a wide variety of charitable endeavors. During weather and other emergencies, our audience and government officials rely on our radio stations to disseminate critical, occasionally life-saving, information. Our radio stations and local websites also routinely support charity and community events through on-air and digital promotions to bolster fundraising activities and emergency relief efforts. These efforts further strengthen our position with both our audience and our advertisers.
Reliable and Substantial Cash Flow Generation.
Our business enjoys strong cash flow generation owing to the relatively limited capital needs of our operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $18.1 million of capital expenditures, excluding $3.2 million of capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations, which represented 4.2% of net revenue during the same period. In addition, we benefit from certain tax attributes that generate tax deductions which have historically limited the amount of cash taxes we pay. 
Strong, Experienced and Incentivized Management Team and Committed, Well-Capitalized Sponsors.
We have an experienced senior management team with a proven, multi-disciplinary track record of delivering results for stakeholders. Further, certain funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”) own a majority of our equity. Oaktree is a leading global investment management firm focused on alternative markets and provides strong sponsorship and strategic support for our continued growth.
Operating Strategy
The principal features of our operating strategy are:
Solidify Our Position in Our Markets.
Our market positioning is supported by the demonstrable and consistent positive results our products produce for advertisers. The price point for radio advertising on a cost per thousand basis is lower than most other local media that deliver similar scale. This makes radio more affordable and accessible for the type of small and mid-sized businesses typically found in our markets.
Continue to Build Our Premium Portfolio of Brands.
Our branding strategy is fundamental to growing our audience and revenue. Across our markets, we have a large portfolio of distinct local brands that resonate with and appeal to our audiences. Many of our brands have several decades of heritage in our markets. Consumers associate our brands with high quality, locally-relevant content and entertainment. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotions in support of our brands and to actively participate in community events to increase our local market presence.
Deepen Relationships with Advertisers to Increase Share of Advertising Spend.
We are committed to growing our sales force, training our sales personnel and investing in programs that allow us to deepen relationships with our advertisers, including developing new products that will allow our content, and our advertisers, to reach a broader audience more frequently and in more locations. Over time, we believe we can capture a greater share of the advertising expenditure in our markets across all mediums.
Diversify Revenue Mix by Continuing to Grow Digital Revenue Streams.
The natural synergies between our products allow us to leverage our operating structure and further monetize existing audience and advertiser relationships. We intend to continue to develop new digital products and offerings and to better monetize our digital audience.
Continue to Develop New Products That Foster Interaction with Our Audience Across Multiple Mediums and Increase Monetization Opportunities.
Our audience reach, combined with our direct relationship with local advertisers in our markets, positions us to launch and monetize new products and services, further diversifying and growing our revenue. In the past, we have introduced a mobile station streaming application (radioPup), an e-commerce product (Seize the Deal), a digital presence and marketing solutions platform (Townsquare Interactive), a programmatic digital advertising platform (Townsquare Ignite), mobile applications for individual stations and brands and new events (including the Taste of Country Music Festival). In addition to delivering non-spot revenue growth, these products and services which we continue to develop, frequently appeal to advertisers in our markets who may not access our radio products, thereby increasing our overall customer base and advertising market share.
Focus on Differentiated Live and Local Content.
We generally provide a larger proportion of live and local content relative to other local media companies in our markets. We believe such live and local content is more engaging to our audience and differentiates our offerings in an increasingly crowded media landscape, mitigating the threat of audience attrition. Many competing audio media offerings, including Spotify, Pandora and SiriusXM, do not offer local content in our markets. We intend to continue providing audiences with this differentiated content and enjoy the advantages it provides us with our audience and our advertisers.
Capitalize on Strong Positions and Brands in Country, News/Talk/Sports, and Rock Formats.
We own 71 radio stations formatted with Country content, 68 formatted with News/Talk/Sports content and 62 formatted with Rock content, representing approximately 22%, 21% and 19% of our radio stations, respectively. The majority of our radio stations airing these formats capture the largest audience among radio stations airing similar content in their respective markets, as ranked by Nielsen or other ratings services. We create audio programming, online content and live events which leverage our strength in these formats, together with the strength of our brands. We intend to continue to use our expertise and knowledge in these formats to share best practices and optimize content across our portfolio in order to maximize audience aggregation within these formats.
Leverage Scalable Structure and Continue to Improve Operating Efficiencies Across Our Company.
Our various media products share common, largely fixed-cost operating infrastructure, resulting in significant scale economies. We also negotiate vendor contracts with key suppliers on a centralized basis, which reduces costs. As a result, as we grow our revenue, a significant majority of each incremental dollar of revenue is converted into incremental earnings.
Acquisition Strategy
The principal features of our acquisition strategy are:
Prudently Pursue Attractively-Valued Acquisition Opportunities.
We have a successful track record of integrating acquisitions. We intend to continue to pursue attractively-priced acquisitions of radio stations, digital properties and live events. We target assets that have strong brands, enjoy leading market share positions, generate strong cash flow and generally possess traits consistent with our existing assets. In addition, acquiring assets allows us to further achieve certain economies of scale, share best practices across a broader platform and diversify our revenue base across our properties and geographies.
Add to Our Portfolio of Attractive Radio Station Clusters.
Since our Company’s founding by the current senior management team in 2010, we have expanded our radio station portfolio from 60 to 321 by completing more than 10 radio transactions. Radio station ownership in the United States remains significantly fragmented with over 3,000 owners operating over 10,000 commercial radio stations. While current FCC ownership limitations restrict our ability to acquire incremental radio stations in many of our markets, there remain a large number of markets with characteristics that are consistent with Townsquare’s acquisition criteria, in which we have no presence today. Given our acquisition track record, we are viewed by many sellers of radio stations to be a potential buyer of their stations, which has provided us with the opportunity to review the majority of properties sold in recent years. We expect to remain active and disciplined from a valuation perspective in the radio station marketplace.
Augment the Growth of Our Digital and Live Events Product Offerings Through Acquisitions.
In addition to our radio acquisition activity, since 2010 we have executed more than thirty acquisitions of assets in the digital and live events sectors, which have further extended our multi-product, cross-platform offering and provided geographic and revenue diversification. The acquired assets included certain assets of AOL Music, XXL, multi-day music festivals, various trade shows, and other live events properties. We strive to leverage our existing platform in combination with the acquired assets to drive operating efficiencies and financial performance. In many cases, we are able to template acquired live event properties and syndicate them into additional markets across our footprint. We expect to continue to consider opportunities in the digital and live events acquisition marketplace.
Evaluate New Product Opportunities.
We have evaluated a number of acquisition opportunities in other sectors that we view as adjacent and complementary to our existing asset portfolio. We expect to continue to consider such opportunities and potentially take action, in the event that we find an opportunity that provides a natural extension to our core competencies, further diversifies our revenue and demonstrates a risk-reward profile that meets our stringent requirements.
Sources of Revenue
We generate revenue by selling multiple products and services across a range of media platforms. We approach our media products holistically, maximizing our revenue potential by pursuing integrated cross-platform sales and solutions for our advertising clients. Specifically, we offer advertisers cross-platform packages that incorporate our audience reach across radio, websites, social media, online video, mobile, voice activated smart speakers, digital marketing solutions, e-commerce and live events.
Our revenue is generated primarily through the integrated sale of the following solutions:

• | Spot radio advertisements that air on our radio stations via terrestrial radios, computers, mobile devices, connected devices such as cars and TVs, and voice activated smart speakers sold to local, regional and national advertisers.


• | Sponsorships, live reads and endorsements in our radio programming, website content, video channels and social media sold to local, regional and national advertisers.


• | Remote broadcasts of our radio stations at advertisers’ places of business sold to local and regional advertisers.


• | Barter-based auctions sold to local and regional advertisers.


• | Display, sponsorship and video advertising, including custom developed digital advertisement products on our radio station websites, owned and operated national websites as well as our affiliate websites, mobile applications, social media platforms, YouTube Channels, email newsletters and digital programmatic advertising platform, to local, regional and national advertisers. Display and sponsorship advertising on our mobile streaming application, radioPup, and our individual stations’ mobile applications, sold to local, regional and national advertisers.


• | Advertising and sponsorships in our radio stations’ online radio streams accessible on computing devices and voice activated smart speakers as well as on mobile devices through our mobile streaming application, radioPup, or individual station mobile applications, sold to local, regional and national advertisers.


• | Sponsored video content, including branded content series, often featuring musicians or other celebrities, and distributed across our portfolio of local and/or national digital properties and social media channels, sold to local, regional and national advertisers.


• | Portfolio of digital marketing solutions including both traditional and mobile enabled website development and hosting services, e-commerce platforms, search engine and online directory optimization services, online reputation management, social media management and website retargeting sold to local and regional small and mid-sized businesses.


• | E-Commerce offerings, including daily deals, ongoing deals and auctions sold to local and regional advertisers.


• | Admission tickets, merchandise, food and other concessions, and other ancillary products and services sold to our audience.


• | Sponsorships, exhibit space and activations sold to our local, regional and national advertisers.


• | Licenses of our brands and content, sold to other media companies.

We believe we are positioned to generate growth in revenue by increasing audience interaction with our radio stations, local and national websites, online radio streams, social media platforms, YouTube Channels, mobile applications and live events, as well as utilizing our digital programmatic advertising platform, which leads to an enhanced share of advertising expenditures, as well as an increased share of consumer spending. 
Customers
No single customer accounts for more than 1% of revenue in any of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018. A significant percentage of our advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising to the automotive, financial services, health services, entertainment, and retail industries.
Our Industry
The local media industry is an important medium for advertisers to reach targeted local consumers and for consumers to engage with relevant local content and events. According to SNL Kagan, in 2018 local advertising spending across all U.S. major media categories totaled $88.0 billion. Since 2013, U.S. local advertising has increased at a 4.7% compound annual growth rate and is projected to grow at a 4.3% compound annual growth rate through 2023. In 2018, local advertising spending on radio and digital, among our target categories, totaled $52.4 billion while consumer spending on live event tickets and advertiser spending on live event sponsorships, event marketing, and activation opportunities were also substantial and growing markets. Since 2013, U.S. local advertising spending on radio and digital has increased at a 13.5% compound annual growth rate and is projected to grow at a 7.5% compound annual growth rate through 2023.
Radio. The primary source of revenue for radio broadcasting companies is the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national spot advertisers, and national network advertisers. According to SNL Kagan, over the past 10 years radio advertising has generally represented approximately 5.5% to 7.3% of the overall U.S. advertising market, and has typically followed macroeconomic growth trends. In 2018, radio advertising revenue  reached $14.0 billion of which $10.4 billion was from local radio advertising. The radio industry has a stable and engaged audience base and continues to be one of the core methods for advertisers to reach their targeted audience. According to Nielsen, terrestrial radio broadcasts reached approximately 90% of American adults age 12+ each week as of December 2018, a level that has remained substantially unchanged since 1970.
Digital. The primary source of revenue for national and local websites, accessed either from a PC, tablet or mobile device, is the sale of search ads, display ads and video advertising directly to advertisers and indirectly through advertising networks and exchanges. According to SNL Kagan, in 2018 digital advertising revenue  reached $91.9 billion of which $42.0 billion was local. Since 2013, local digital advertising has represented one of the fastest growing local media advertising categories with a compound annual growth rate of 20.5%, outpacing national advertising which grew at 13.7%.  Local digital advertising is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.1% through 2023 and continue to gain market share on national advertising which is projected to grow at 3.4%.
Live Events. The primary source of revenue for live events is the sale of tickets to attendees and sponsorships, event marketing, and activation opportunities for local, regional and national advertisers. According to IBIS World, total revenue from the U.S. live event industry, which includes the creation, management and promotion of live performances and events, ranging from concerts and theater performances to state fairs and air shows, grew to $31.0 billion in 2018, up from $23.9 billion in 2013, which represents a 5.3% compound annual growth rate. According to Pollstar, North American live events gross ticket sales totaled $6.8 billion in 2018, up from $5.0 billion in 2013, which represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.2%. Concert tour gross revenues increased in 2018 by 0.4% to $3.7 billion, as measured by the top 100 grossing North American concert ticket sales.
Competition
The local media industry is very competitive. The success of each of our radio stations, digital properties and live events depends largely upon each product’s ability to attract audiences, pricing, the number of local media competitors and the overall demand for advertising within individual markets. We mitigate these competitive pressures by focusing on small to mid-sized markets, where there are fewer and less well-capitalized local media competitors across all mediums, including radio stations, broadcast television stations, pay television networks, locally-focused websites, live events, outdoor advertising, newspapers, magazines and directories. The lack of competition often allows our brands to garner a greater share of both the local audience and advertising expenditures in our markets.
Radio
Our radio stations compete directly for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations within their respective markets as well as with other alternative mediums including satellite radio, television, print and digital media. Additionally, online music services have begun to sell advertising locally, creating additional competition for both audience and advertisers. By building strong brands with a targeted audience consisting of specific demographic groups in each of our markets, we are able to attract advertisers seeking to reach those particular audiences.
Factors that affect a radio station’s competitive position include its brand identity and audience loyalty, management experience, the radio station’s local audience rank in its market (which is highly affected by the competitive radio landscape in a market and format changes that occur from time to time), transmitter power and location, assigned frequency, audience characteristics, local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area. We attempt to improve our competitive position in each market by constantly researching and improving the content of our radio stations and websites, implementing advertising campaigns aimed at the demographic groups for which our radio stations target content and managing our sales efforts to attract a larger share of advertising dollars for each radio station individually.
Local Digital Content
Our websites compete for audiences and advertisers directly with other local radio station websites, television station websites, newspaper websites, online directories, local sections of national digital properties, blogs and other types of locally focused websites, as well as all national and international websites. We attempt to improve our competitive position, maximize our audience and grow our revenue by focusing on high quality, differentiated local content and by providing innovative and effective advertising integration for our customers.
Digital Marketing Solutions
The market for local online advertising solutions is competitive and dynamic. Some of our competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. Our competitors include large internet marketing providers, offline media companies such as yellow page publishers, newspaper and television companies as well as other local SMB marketing providers.
Live Events
Our live events compete for audiences and sponsorships with both national competitors, such as Live Nation and AEG, and a variety of local or regional competitors, promoters and event marketing companies. Additionally, we compete with venue operators, including arenas, theaters and casinos, which bring in live entertainment directly. 
National Digital Content
Our national digital assets compete for audience and advertisers with a diverse and large pool of advertising, media and internet companies. We expect that this competition will persist in the future as a result of the continuing maturation of the industry and a lack of significant barriers to entry. Our success will depend upon a number of factors, including the quality of content on our owned and operated websites, the ability to manage search engine optimization efforts to direct traffic to these websites, our sales efforts and the ability to remain price competitive.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 2,821 full and part-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
We employ individuals in a large variety of roles. On occasion, in order to protect our interests, we enter into employment agreements with certain of our employees, including members of senior management, product leaders, local market presidents and selected sales personnel and local media personalities. We do not believe that the loss of any one these individuals, excluding certain key members of our senior management, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, taken as a whole. Our risks related to losing key members of our senior management are more fully described in the section titled “Risk Factors.”

The ownership, operation and sale of radio stations, including those licensed to us, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under authority of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act and directed the FCC to change certain of its broadcast rules. Among its other regulatory responsibilities, the FCC issues permits and licenses to construct and operate radio stations; assigns broadcast frequencies; determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of radio station licenses; regulates transmission equipment, operating power and other technical parameters of radio stations; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of radio stations; regulates some forms of radio broadcast content; and has the authority under the Communications Act to impose penalties for violations of its rules.
The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and relevant FCC rules and published policies (collectively, the “Communications Laws”). This description does not purport to be comprehensive and reference should be made to the Communications Laws, public notices, and decisions issued by the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations. Failure to observe the provisions of the 
Communications Laws can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures and the grant of a “short-term” (less than the maximum term) license renewal. For particularly egregious violations, the FCC may deny a radio station’s license renewal application, revoke a radio station’s license, or deny applications in which an applicant seeks to acquire additional broadcast properties.
License Grant and Renewal
Radio broadcast licenses are generally granted and renewed for terms of eight years. Licenses are renewed by filing an application with the FCC. Petitions to deny license renewal applications may be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. While we are not currently aware of any facts that would prevent the renewal of our licenses to operate our radio stations, there can be no assurance that any of our licenses will be renewed for a full term.
Service Areas
Each class of FM station has the right to broadcast with a certain amount of power from an antenna located at a certain height. The most powerful FM radio stations are Class C FM radio stations, which may operate with the equivalent of up to 100 kilowatts of effective radiated power (“ERP”) at an antenna height of up to 1,968 feet above average terrain. These radio stations typically provide service to large areas that cover one or more counties. There are also Class C0, C1, C2 and C3 FM radio stations which may operate with progressively less power and/or antenna height. Class B FM stations operate with the equivalent of up to 50 kilowatts ERP at an antenna height of up to 492 feet above average terrain. Class B radio stations typically serve large metropolitan areas and their outer suburban areas. There are also Class B1 radio stations that can operate with up to 25 kilowatts ERP at an antenna height of up to 328 feet above average terrain. Class A FM radio stations may operate with the equivalent of 6 kilowatts ERP at an antenna height of up to 328 feet above average terrain, and generally serve smaller cities and towns or suburbs of larger cities.
The area served by an AM radio station is determined by a combination of frequency, transmitter power, antenna orientation and soil conductivity. The effective service area of an AM radio station is determined based on the radio station’s power, operating frequency, antenna patterns and its day/night operating modes. The area served by a FM radio station is determined by a combination of transmitter power and antenna height, with radio stations divided into eight classes according to these technical parameters, as set forth above.
The following table sets forth, as of February 6, 2019, the market, call letters, cities of license, frequencies, FCC license expiration dates, and our markets’ population rankings as reported by Nielsen, of all our owned radio stations and all stations operated under Time Brokerage Agreements (“TBAs”) or Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”).

Regulatory Approvals
The Communications Laws prohibit the assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant an application for assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license, the Communications Act requires the FCC to find that the assignment or transfer would serve the public interest. The FCC considers a number of factors in making this determination, including (i) compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, (ii) the financial and “character” qualifications of the assignee or transferee (including those parties holding an “attributable” interest in the assignee or transferee), (iii) compliance with the Communications Act’s foreign ownership restrictions, and (iv) compliance with other Communications Laws, including those related to content and filing requirements.
As discussed in greater detail below, the FCC may also review the effect of proposed assignments and transfers of broadcast licenses on economic competition and diversity. See “Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations.”
Ownership Matters
The Communications Act restricts us from having more than one-fourth of our equity owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, foreign governments or non-U.S. entities, without prior approval from the FCC.
The Communications Laws also restrict the number of radio stations one person or entity may own, operate or control in a local market.
None of these rules requires any change in our current ownership of radio stations. The Communications Laws could limit the number of additional radio stations that we may acquire in the future in our existing markets as well as new markets.
The FCC generally applies its rules and its broadcast multiple ownership rules by considering the “attributable” or cognizable interests held by a person or entity. With some exceptions, a person or entity will be deemed to hold an attributable interest in a radio station if the person or entity serves as an officer, director, partner, stockholder, member, or, in certain cases, a debt holder of a company that owns that station. Whether that interest is attributable and thus subject to the FCC’s multiple ownership rules is determined by the FCC’s attribution rules. If an interest is attributable, the FCC treats the person or entity who holds that interest as an “owner” of the radio station in question, and that interest thus counts against the person in determining compliance with the FCC’s ownership rules.
With respect to a partnership (or limited liability company), only the interest of a general partner (or managing member) is attributable if the entity’s organizational documents include certain terms. With respect to a corporation, officers, directors and persons or entities that directly or indirectly hold 5.0% or more of the corporation’s voting stock (20.0% or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies, investment companies, bank trust departments and certain other “passive investors” that hold such stock for investment purposes only) generally are attributed with ownership of the radio stations, television stations and daily newspapers owned by the corporation. As discussed below, participation in an LMA or a Joint Sales Agreement (“JSA”) also may result in an attributable interest. See “Local Marketing Agreements” and “Joint Sales Agreements.”
The following interests generally are not attributable:

1. | debt instruments, non-voting stock, and options and warrants for voting stock, partnership interests, or membership interests that have not yet been exercised; Non-voting equity and debt interests which, in the aggregate, constitute more than 33.0% of a radio station’s “enterprise value” (which consists of the total equity and debt capitalization) are considered attributable in certain circumstances;


2. | limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where (a) the limited partner or member is not “materially involved” in the media-related activities of the partnership or limited liability company, and (b) the limited partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement expressly “insulates” the limited partner or member from such material involvement by inclusion of provisions specified in FCC rules; and


3. | holders of less than 5.0% of an entity’s voting stock.

In November 2017, as part of its periodic review of broadcast ownership rules required by the Communications Act, the FCC adopted an Order on Reconsideration and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Order”) addressing its ownership rules. The Order eliminated the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership prohibition, including the ban on common ownership of newspapers and radio stations within the same market. The Order also eliminated the radio/television cross-ownership rule. These and other aspects of the Order are being challenged in federal court. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of this appeal or whether it will have a material adverse effect on us.
Content and Operation
The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest.” To satisfy that obligation, broadcasters are required by the Communications Laws to present content that is responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness. Complaints from audiences concerning a radio station’s content may be filed at any time and will be considered by the FCC both at the time they are filed and in connection with a licensee’s renewal application. FCC rules also require broadcasters to provide equal employment opportunities (“EEO”) in the hiring of new personnel, to abide by certain procedures in advertising employment opportunities, to make information available on employment opportunities on their websites (if they have one), and to maintain certain records concerning their compliance with EEO rules. The FCC will entertain individual complaints concerning a broadcast licensee’s failure to abide by the EEO rules and also conducts random audits on broadcast licensees’ compliance with EEO rules. We have been the subject of several EEO audits. To date, none of those audits has disclosed any major violation that would have a material adverse effect on our operations. Radio stations also must follow provisions in the Communications Laws that regulate a variety of other activities, including political advertising, the broadcast of obscene or indecent content, sponsorship identification, the broadcast of contests and lotteries, and technical operations (including limits on radio frequency radiation).
Local Marketing Agreements
A number of radio stations, including certain of our radio stations, have entered into Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) (also known as Time Brokerage Agreements). In a typical LMA, the licensee of a radio station makes available, for a fee, airtime on its radio station to a party which supplies content to be broadcast during that airtime and collects revenue from advertising aired during such content. LMAs are subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the Communications Laws, including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the radio station and, in particular, its personnel, content and finances. The FCC has held that such agreements do not violate the Communications Laws as long as the licensee of the radio station receiving content from another station maintains ultimate responsibility for, and control over radio station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the Communications Laws.
A radio station that brokers more than 15.0% of the weekly content hours on another radio station in its market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered radio station for purposes of the FCC’s ownership rules. As a result, a radio station may not enter into a LMA that allows it to program more than 15.0% of the weekly content hours of another radio station that it could not own under the FCC’s multiple ownership rules.
Joint Sales Agreements
From time to time, radio stations enter into JSAs. A typical JSA authorizes one radio station to sell another radio station’s advertising time and retain the revenue from the sale of that airtime. A JSA typically includes a periodic payment to the radio station whose airtime is being sold (which may include a share of the revenue being collected from the sale of airtime). Like LMAs, JSAs are subject to compliance with antitrust laws and the Communications Laws, including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the radio station and, in particular, its personnel, content and finances. The FCC has held that such agreements do not violate the Communications Laws as long as the licensee of the radio station whose time is being sold by another station maintains ultimate responsibility for, and control over, radio station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the Communications Laws.
Under the Communications Laws, a radio station owner that sells more than 15.0% of the weekly advertising time of another radio station in the same market will be attributed with the ownership of that other station. In that situation, a station cannot have a JSA with another station in the same market if the FCC’s ownership rules would otherwise prohibit that common ownership.
Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations
Potential future acquisitions, to the extent they meet specified size thresholds, will be subject to applicable waiting periods and possible review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), by the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) or the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), either of whom can be required to evaluate a transaction to determine whether that transaction should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws. Transactions are subject to the HSR Act only if the acquisition price or fair market value of the radio stations to be acquired is above a certain threshold that increases periodically (presently $90.0 million as of March 8, 2019). Our acquisitions have not met this threshold. Acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the HSR Act may still be investigated by the DOJ or the FTC under the antitrust laws before or after consummation. At any time before or after the consummation of a proposed acquisition, the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or certain of our other assets. The DOJ has reviewed numerous radio station acquisitions where an operator proposes to acquire additional radio stations in its existing markets or multiple radio stations in new markets and has challenged a number of such transactions. Some of these challenges have resulted in consent decrees requiring the sale of certain radio stations, the termination of LMAs or other relief. In general, the Department of Justice has more closely scrutinized radio mergers and acquisitions resulting in local market shares in excess of 35.0% of local radio advertising revenue, depending on format, signal strength and other factors. There is no precise numerical rule, however, and certain transactions resulting in more than 35.0% revenue shares have not been challenged, while certain other transactions may be challenged based on other criteria such as audience shares in one or more demographic groups as well as the percentage of revenue share. We estimate that we have more than a 35.0% share of radio advertising revenue in many of our markets.
The DOJ enforces the antitrust laws in the broadcasting industry and there can be no assurance that one or more of any future acquisitions will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by the DOJ. Similarly, there can be no assurance that the DOJ, the FTC or the FCC will not prohibit such acquisitions, require that they be restructured, or 
require that we divest radio stations we already own in connection with an acquisition. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition.
As part of its review of certain radio station acquisitions, the DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that commencement of operations under LMAs, JSAs and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station ownership assignments and transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act could violate the HSR Act. Accordingly, our policy is not to commence operation under an LMA, a JSA, or similar agreement of any affected radio station to be acquired until the waiting period under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated.
