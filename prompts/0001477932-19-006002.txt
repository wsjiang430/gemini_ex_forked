About our Claims

The Company no longer has any mining Assets. All mining claims and assets were disposed of and or transferred in exchange of the cancellation of Convertible Notes held by various Note Holders.
About our Online Social Gaming Technology

GMGI has changed the direction of the Company business to focus on software technology. 

Whilst there are a number of companies that provide similar products for social online gaming operators, the Company has unique IP and is focused on the Asian market. The unique technology, Company’s location, focused resources and experience in this market provide the Company with a distinct advantage over other companies located in other parts of the world and having limited experience in Asia. 
Competition

Our primary competition is expected from overseas based online gaming technology companies. With few exceptions, significant listed gaming companies (many of which are listed on the London Stock Exchange) operate using their own software. As an independent online gaming technology provider, we believe that we retain the ability to utilize the most profitable platform available and are not restricted to a single platform. Additionally, by ensuring that we operate in compliance with U.S. laws, we believe that in the event of legalized gaming in the U.S., we would not be precluded from taking advantage of U.S.-based gaming.
Employees

As of the date of this report, we have no employees other than our directors. We currently conduct our business using the services of consultants and outside contractors. We do not intend to have any material change in the number of employees over the next 12 months. Where possible, we intend to conduct our business largely through consultants on a contract and fee for service basis.
