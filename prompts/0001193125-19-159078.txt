 A more detailed discussion of sales by category of product is included under the section entitled Principal Products by Division. 
 The Companys manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in Kentucky, Georgia and Florida. 
 The Company continues to explore opportunities to expand its product offerings in the display industry. The Company anticipates that this expansion will be achieved by adding new products or by acquiring existing companies that would enhance the Companys position in the display industry. Management continually evaluates product trends externally in the industry and internally in the divisions in which the Company operates. 
Segment Information 
 We operate and manage our business as one segment. The five divisions have similarities such as the types of products and markets served. Therefore, we believe they meet the criteria for aggregation under the applicable authoritative guidance and, as such, are reported as one segment within the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Principal Products by Division 
 Simulation and Training Products 
 The Companys simulation and training products operations are conducted in Cocoa, Floridas VDC Display Systems (Display Systems). 
 This portion of the Companys operations, which contributed approximately 36% of fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales, involves the design, engineering, and manufacture of digital projector display units. The Company customizes these units for specific applications, including ruggedization for military uses or size reduction due to space limitations in industrial and medical applications. Because of the Companys flexible and cost efficient manufacturing, it is able to handle low volume orders that generate higher margins. 
 This portion of the Companys operations targets niche markets where competition from major multinational electronics companies tends to be lower. The prime customers for these products include defense, security, training, and simulation areas of the United States of America (U.S.) and foreign militaries as well as the major defense contractors such as the Boeing Company, L-3 Communications Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, and others. Flight simulator displays are produced to provide a full range of flight training simulations for military and commercial applications.

 Cyber Secure Products 
 The Company acquired the AYON Cyber Security (ACS) division in March 2012. ACS was formerly known as Hetra Products and most recently as StingRay56 before becoming part of Video Display Corporation. ACS specializes in advanced TEMPEST technology, also known as Emanation Security (EMSEC), products and custom engineering solutions to include extreme environmental performance and survivability technologies (MIL-STD-810 and DO-160) in support of military forces, intelligence agencies, prime contractors and niche commercial sectors worldwide. ACS has a long history of specializing in TEMPEST technology. In addition to its TEMPEST products and services, the business also provides various contract services to government agencies and prime contractors. Services performed include design and testing solutions for defense and niche commercial uses worldwide. ACS has office in the U.S., a representative in Canada, a Reseller Relationship/Partner in Europe and technology partners around the globe. This division represented approximately 36% of fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales. 
 Data Display CRTs 
 Since its organization in 1975, the Company has been engaged in the distribution and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) using new and recycled CRT glass bulbs, primarily in the replacement market, for use in data display screens, including computer terminal monitors, medical monitoring equipment and various other data display applications and in television sets. 
 The Companys CRT manufacturing operation of new and recycled CRTs is conducted at a facility located in Lexington, Kentucky (Lexel). The Companys Tucker, Georgia location is the Companys primary distribution point for data display CRTs purchased from outside sources. 
 The Company maintains the capability of manufacturing a full range of monochrome CRTs as well as remanufacturing color CRTs from recycled glass. In addition, our Lexel operations manufactures a wide range of radar, infrared, camera and direct-view storage tubes for military and security applications. All CRTs manufactured by the Company are tested for quality in accordance with standards approved by Underwriters Laboratories. 
 The Company also distributes new CRTs and other electronic tubes purchased from OEMs. The Company sells CRTs into the replacement market which sometimes takes five to seven years to develop; these purchased inventories sometimes do not sell as quickly as other inventories. Bulk CRT purchases have declined over the past few years as the Company is managing current inventory levels against the anticipated reduction in future CRT demand due to the growth of flat panel technology. 
 The Company maintains an internal sales organization to sell directly to OEMs and their service organizations. 
 In addition to factors affecting the overall market for such products, the Companys sales volume in the CRT replacement markets is dependent upon the Companys ability to provide prompt response to customers orders, while maintaining quality control and competitive pricing. The Data Display division represented approximately 17% of fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales. 
 Broadcast and Control Center Products 
 The Company began a start-up operation in July 2011, AYON Visual Solutions, as the North American distributor of a German company, eyevis GmbH. The division sells high-end visual display products for use in video walls and command and control centers. 
 The division has been built thus far by partnering with consultants and system integrators. These partners have first-hand knowledge of the needs of the market and have been educated about the divisions products. Management believes the division will continue to grow by expanding their network of partners and product offerings as eyevis GmbH introduces new products. This division represented approximately 1% of fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales. This division was absorbed by the simulation and training products division in the Companys fourth quarter to increase opportunities by using the resources available in the simulation division.

 Other Computer Products 
 The Company acquired a small keyboard company on October 23, 2017. The Company long term plans are to use this as a platform to manufacture cyber-secure keyboards as part of the cyber security division. This division was 10% of the 2019 consolidated net sales. 
Patents and Trademarks 
 The Company holds patents with respect to certain products and services. The Company also sells products under various trademarks and trade names. The Company believes that success in its industry primarily will be dependent upon incorporating emerging technology into new product line introductions, frequent product enhancements, and customer support and service. 
Seasonal Variations in Business 
 Historically, there has not been seasonal variability in the Companys business. 
 Working Capital Practices 
 Currently, the Company has a $0.5 million line of credit with the Brand Banking Company with no amounts outstanding at February 28, 2019. The other outstanding debt of the Company includes a $0.1 million note secured by a building owned by the Companys subsidiary, Teltron Technologies, Inc. in Birdsboro, PA., $0.1 million on a note payable associated with the acquisition of Unicomp, a keyboard manufacturer and $0.1 million on a note with the CEO of the Company. 
 Management has implemented a plan to improve the liquidity of the Company. The Company has been implementing a plan to increase revenues at all the divisions, each structured to the particular division with an increase in revenues of over $3.0 million for fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. The Company is expanding its cyber secure business by adding a second testing chamber for testing tempest products allowing it to increase the business in cyber testing services to supplement the product side of the business. The Company is also now involved in ruggedized displays, recently bringing on engineering familiar with these products. The Company implemented a plan to reduce expenses at the divisions, as well as at the corporate location during the fiscal year ending February 28, 2019 with the closing of two divisions and relocating the operations of those two divisions to other divisions within the Company with similar business activities. The Company is also in the process of moving the corporate accounting functions to the Cocoa, Florida location which allows the Company to become more efficient and save money on reducing redundant operations. The Company moved two of its plants in an effort to reduce expenses and increase efficiencies. The plant move at its subsidiary in Lexington, Kentucky, took longer than anticipated and negatively affected cash flow. The long term prospects for this subsidiary are promising and management is now seeing a turn around. The plant move at the Florida operations was successful as the Company merged two businesses and was able to keep production on schedule. Management continues to explore options to monetize certain long-term assets of the business, including the possible sale of a building in Pennsylvania. If additional and more permanent capital is required to fund the operations of the Company, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to obtain the capital on terms favorable to the Company, if at all. 
 The Company is currently operating using cash from operations and investing activities. The Company has a $3.5 million working capital balance at February 28, 2019, including $0.4 million in liquid assets. 
 Concentration of Customers 
 The Company sells to a variety of domestic and international customers on an open-unsecured account basis. These customers principally operate in the medical, military, industrial and avionics industries. The Company had direct and indirect net sales to the U.S. government, primarily the Department of Defense for training and simulation programs that comprised approximately 53% and 50% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Sales to foreign customers were approximately 11% and 16% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had three customers, E-Tel 19%, Lockheed Martin 14%, and the US Department of State 12% of the Companys consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019. The Company attempts to minimize credit risk by reviewing customers credit history before extending credit, and by monitoring customers credit exposure on a daily basis. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
