Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 We are a late-stage pharmaceutical company focused on leveraging our extensive development and oncology expertise to identify and advance new therapies intended to meaningfully improve the treatment of cancer. Our approach to building our pipeline is to acquire oncology drug candidates and create value in programs through clinical development, commercialization and strategic partnerships. 
 Our portfolio of drug candidates contains four clinical-stage candidates, including one candidate in an ongoing Phase 3 global registration trial and another candidate in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial to support an accelerated approval of a marketing application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under 21 CFR Part 314.500, Subpart H. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol MEIP. 
 Clinical Development Programs 
 Cancer is often a highly adaptable disease capable of evading the bodys defenses and resisting treatment, allowing it to grow and spread. Despite new treatments that strive to leverage actionable insights into cancer biology, even the most cutting-edge therapies can struggle to balance potency with safety. As a result, the oncology community strives to improve on existing therapies and search for new and better options to optimize benefits for patients. This approach includes medicines that not only act as monotherapies, but also work well in combination with other therapies to deliver the best possible outcomes. 
 We currently have four clinical-stage development programs with diverse approaches to inhibiting cancer, including epigenetics, cell signalling and cancer metabolism: 
 

 | ME-401, an oral phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) delta inhibitor;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Voruciclib, an oral cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | ME-344, a mitochondrial inhibitor targeting the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pracinostat, an oral histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

ME-401: PI3Kd Inhibitor in a Phase 2 Trial to Support an Accelerated Approval in Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma

 ME-401 is an oral, once-daily, selective PI3Kd inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. We own worldwide rights to ME-401 in all geographies except Japan, which we licensed to Kyowa Kirin Company (formerly Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd.) (KKC) in 2018. 
 MEI is conducting two ongoing studies evaluating ME-401. The first is a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ME-401 as a monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after failure of at least two prior systemic therapies including chemotherapy and an anti-CD20 antibody. Subject to the results, upon completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial, we are planning a submission with the FDA to support an accelerated approval of a marketing application under 21 CFR Part 314.500, Subpart H. The second is a multi-arm, open-label, Phase 1b dose escalation and expansion trial evaluating ME-401 as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies or investigational agents in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. 
 While PI3Kd inhibitors as a group are a clinically validated class for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, the FDA approved orally administered products, idelalisib (marketed as Zydelig®) and duvelisib (marketed as COPIKTRA®), and the intravenously administered PI3Kd/α inhibitor copanlisib (marketed as Aliqopa®), are challenged by dose-limiting toxicities. We believe this provides an opportunity for the development of a next-generation candidate with pharmaceutical properties that may better maximize the biological potential of PI3Kd inhibition by limiting toxicities, which hinder clinical utility. 
 The molecular structure and pharmacodynamic characteristics of ME-401 are distinct from the FDA approved PI3Kd inhibitors. ME-401 is characterized by prolonged target binding, preferential cellular accumulation, high volume of distribution throughout the body tissues, and an approximately 28-hour half-life suitable for once daily oral administration. These properties of ME-401 allow exploration of flexible dosing regimens such as an intermittent dosing schedule, which has the potential to maintain clinical benefit while minimizing immune-related toxicities common to other PI3Kd agents, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapies or investigational agents. 
 ME-401 Scientific Overview: at the Crossroads of B-cell Signalling Pathways 
 The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is an important signaling pathway for many cellular functions such as cell survival, cell cycle progression and cellular growth. PI3Ks are a family of enzymes within this pathway that have been shown to play a critical role in the proliferation and survival of certain cancer cells. Specifically, the PI3Kd isoform is at the crossroads of B-cell receptor signaling pathways that are major drivers of survival and proliferation of many B-cell malignancies. Because the d isoform is largely restricted to leukocytes, it is an attractive target for selectively inhibiting the PI3K pathway in B-cell malignancies. 
 PI3Kd Inhibitors and B-Cell Malignancies 
 Clinical Program 
 MEI is conducting two ongoing studies: a Phase 2 trial evaluating patients with relapsed or refractory FL to support an accelerated approval of a marketing application with the FDA under 21 CFR Part 314.500, Subpart H, and a multi-arm, open-label, Phase 1b dose escalation and expansion trial as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies or investigational agents in patients with FL and other B-cell malignancies.

 Phase 1b Multi-arm Trial 
 In June 2019, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting and the International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (ICML) meeting, we reported updated interim data from the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ME-401 as a monotherapy and in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Over 85 patients were enrolled at the time of the ASCO and ICML presentations, of which data on 71 patients were presented at the meetings for safety, including 54 patients with relapsed or refractory FL and 17 with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). The immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region was unmutated in 82% (9/11) of CLL/SLL patients tested. 
 ME-401 is administered once daily at 60 mg for two 28-day cycles and then on an intermittent schedule of once daily dosing for the first seven days of each subsequent 28-day cycle (i.e. IS). A previous cohort of monotherapy patients in the trial was treated with ME-401 at 60 to 180 mg administered continuously once daily or were switched to the IS in later cycles (i.e. CS). 
 The overall response rate among the 64 patients with relapsed or refractory FL and relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL who were evaluable for efficacy was 83% (54/64); the overall response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory FL was 80% (40/50) and it was 100% in patients with CLL/SLL (14/14). The overall response rate in patients ranged from 75% to 100% across all groups of patients with FL or CLL/SLL and the majority of patients responding, 89%, achieved their response by the end of the second treatment cycle. 
 

Evaluable Patients | FL(N = 50) | | CLL/SLL(N = 14) | | Total(N = 64)
All groups | | 40/50 (80%) | | 14/14 (100%) | | 54/64 (83%)
By treatment arm | | | | | | 
ME-401 monotherapy | | 30/38 (79%) | | 11/11 (100%) | | 41/49 (84%)
ME-401 + rituximab | | 10/12 (83%) | | 3/3 (100%) | | 13/15 (87%)
By schedule | | | | | | 
IS Group | | 15/20 (75%) | | 5/5 (100%) | | 20/25 (80%)
CS Group | | 25/30 (83%) | | 9/9 (100%) | | 34/39 (87%)

 After a median follow up of approximately nine months as of the 2019 ASCO and ICML presentations, the majority of patients remain progression free. 
 ME-401 was generally well-tolerated and no grade 4 or grade 5 adverse events of special interest have been observed in the Phase 1b trial. Among drug related grade 3 adverse events of special interest, the most common are diarrhea/colitis at 9.7% (3/31) on IS dosing and 20% (8/40) on CS dosing, and rash with none on IS dosing and 10% (4/40) on CS dosing, in FL and CLL/SLL patients. 
 The rate of the development of delayed, grade 3 adverse events of special interest was less in patients on the intermittent dosing schedule. Grade 3 elevations in ALT and AST were transient and in each case were associated with grade 3 diarrhea or rash. 
 

Grade 3 Drug Related Adverse Events of Special Interest | CS (N = 40)n (%) | IS (N = 31)n (%)
Diarrhea/Colitis | 8 (20.0%) | 3 (9.7%) 
Rash, all types | 4 (10.0%) | 0 
ALT/AST increased | 3 (7.5%) | 1 (3.2%) 
Mucositis | 1 (2.5%) | 0 
Pneumonia/Pneumonitis | 5 (12.5%) | 1 (3.2%) 

 The Phase 1b trial is additionally evaluating ME-401 (60 mg) in combination with zanubrutinib, an investigational inhibitor of Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) being developed by BeiGene, Ltd. (Beigene). Pursuant to a collaboration initiated with BeiGene in October 2018, we began evaluating the safety and efficacy of ME-401 in combination with zanubrutinib for the treatment of patients with various B-cell malignancies. The cost of the combination trial is being equally shared. Each company is supplying its own investigational agent. We retain all commercial rights to ME-401 and BeiGene retains all commercial rights to zanubrutinib. 
 Phase 2 Trial Intended to Support an Accelerated Approval Marketing Application 
 In July 2018, the Company discussed with the FDA an ME-401 monotherapy accelerated approval strategy in patients with relapsed or refractory FL. The FDA communicated support for the Companys proposed randomized Phase 2 trial. An accelerated approval of ME-401 will be subject to FDA review of the improvement provided by ME-401 over other therapies available. 
 We are recruiting patients in the global randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ME-401 in patients with FL after failure of at least two prior systemic therapies including chemotherapy and an anti-CD20 antibody. The study will evaluate both the CS and IS dosing regimens; in one arm, ME-401 will be administered once daily continuously and in the other arm, ME-401 will be administered once daily for two cycles (i.e., eight weeks) followed by an intermittent schedule whereby ME-401 will be administered once daily for the first seven days of a 28-day cycle followed by 21 days of placebo. Approximately 166 patients will be randomized in the trial and the primary efficacy endpoint will be the rate of objective response to therapy and tolerability of ME-401.

 Voruciclib: CDK Inhibitor with CDK9 Inhibition in Phase 1 Studies 
 Voruciclib is an orally administered CDK inhibitor differentiated by its potent in vitro inhibition of CDK9 in addition to CDK6, 4 and 1. Voruciclib is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b dose ranging trial in patients with B-cell malignancies. 
 Voruciclib Scientific Overview: Cell Cycle Signaling 
 The CDK family of proteins are important cell cycle regulators. CDK9 is a transcriptional regulator of the myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL1), a member of the family of anti-apoptotic proteins which, when elevated, may prevent the cell from undergoing cell death. Inhibition of CDK9 blocks the production of MCL1, which is an established resistance mechanism to the B-cell lymphoma (BCL2) inhibitor venetoclax (marketed as Venclexta®). 
 In pre-clinical studies voruciclib shows dose-dependent suppression of MCL1; in December 2017 a study of voruciclib published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports reported that the combination of voruciclib plus the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax was capable of inhibiting two master regulators of cell survival, MCL-1 and BCL-2, and achieved synergistic antitumor efficacy in an aggressive subset of DLBCL pre-clinical models. (Scientific Reports. (2017) 7:18007. DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-18368-w).
Additionally, at the 2018 American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting we presented results from pre-clinical studies demonstrating that voruciclib synergizes with venetoclax to induce apoptosis in both venetoclax sensitive and resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The pre-clinical data further demonstrated that voruciclib transiently downregulates MCL1 and that MCL1 downregulation is likely responsible for the bulk of the synergy between voruciclib and venetoclax. 
 CDK9 is also a transcriptional regulator of MYC, a transcription factor regulating cell proliferation and growth which contributes to many human cancers and is frequently associated with poor prognosis and unfavorable patient survival. Targeting MYC directly has historically been difficult, but CDK9 is a transcriptional regulator of MYC and is a promising approach to target this oncogene. 
 Clinical Program 
 We are evaluating patients with hematological malignancies in a dose ranging Phase 1b clinical trial of voruciclib. The trial is initially intended to evaluate voruciclib as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell malignancies or AML after failure of prior standard therapies to determine the safety, preliminary efficacy and maximum tolerated dose. In parallel, subject to FDA agreement, we also plan to evaluate voruciclib in combination with venetoclax to assess synergies and the opportunity for combination treatments across multiple indications. 
 Voruciclib was previously evaluated in more than 70 patients in multiple Phase 1 studies with a tolerability profile consistent with other drugs in its class. In pre-clinical studies, voruciclib shows dose-dependent suppression of MCL1 at concentrations achievable with doses that appear to be generally well tolerated in earlier Phase 1 studies. Pre-clinical studies additionally show inhibition of MYC protein expression. 
 ME-344: Mitochondrial Inhibitor with Combinatorial Potential 
 ME-344 is our novel and tumor selective, isoflavone-derived mitochondrial inhibitor drug candidate. It directly targets the OXPHOS complex 1, a pathway involved in ATP production in the mitochondria. ME-344 was recently studied in an investigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized clinical trial in combination with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor bevacizumab (marketed as Avastin ®) in a total of 42 patients with HER2 negative breast cancer. 
 ME-344 Scientific Overview: Cancer Metabolism 
 Tumor cells often display a high metabolic rate to support cell division and growth. This heightened metabolism requires a continual supply of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The two major sources of ATP are the specialized cellular organelles termed mitochondria and through the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. 
 ME-344 was identified through a screen of more than 400 new chemical structures originally created based on the central design of naturally occurring plant isoflavones. We believe that some of these synthetic compounds, including our drug candidate ME-344, interact with specific mitochondrial enzyme targets, resulting in the inhibition of ATP generation. When these compounds interact with their target, a rapid reduction in ATP occurs, which leads to a cascade of biochemical events within the cell and ultimately to cell death. 
Clinical Program 
 ME-344 demonstrated evidence of single agent activity against refractory solid tumors in a Phase 1 trial, and in pre-clinical studies tumor cells treated with ME-344 resulted in a rapid loss of ATP and cancer cell death. In addition to single agent activity, ME-344 may also have significant potential in combination with anti-angiogenic therapeutics. While anti-angiogenics reduce the rate of glycolysis in tumors as a mechanism to block growth, tumor metabolism often shifts to mitochondrial metabolism to continue energy production to support continued tumor proliferation. In such cases of tumor plasticity in the presence of treatment with anti-angiogenics, targeting the alternative metabolic source with ME-344 may open an important therapeutic opportunity. 
 Support for this combinatorial use of ME-344 was first published in the June 2016 edition of Cell Reports; pre-clinical data from a collaboration with the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre in Madrid demonstrated mitochondria-specific effects of ME-344 in cancer cells, including substantially enhanced anti-tumor activity when combined with agents that inhibit the activity of VEGF. These data demonstrating the potential anti-cancer effects of combining ME-344 with a VEGF inhibitor due to an inhibition of both mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism provided a basis for commencement of an investigator-initiated trial of ME-344 in combination with bevacizumab in HER2 negative breast cancer patients.

 At ASCO, further support for the combinatorial use of ME-344 with anti-angiogenic therapeutics was presented from a multicenter, investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label, clinical trial that evaluated the combination of ME-344 and bevacizumab in 42 patients with early HER2-negative breast cancer. Patients were randomized one-to-one to either ME-344 in combination with bevacizumab or saline in combination with bevacizumab. 
 The primary objective of the trial was to show proof of ME-344 biologic activity as measured by Ki67 reductions (a measure of cell proliferation that is highly correlated with tumor response) from day 0 to 28 compared to the control group who received bevacizumab alone. Secondary objectives included determining whether ME-344 biologic activity correlates with vascular normalization. The data demonstrate significant biologic activity in the ME-344 treatment group: 
 

 | In ME-344 treated patients, mean absolute Ki67 decreases were 13.3 compared to an increase of 1.1 in the bevacizumab monotherapy group (P=0.01).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In ME-344 treated patients, mean relative Ki67 decreases were 23% compared to an increase of 186% in the bevacizumab monotherapy group (P < 0.01).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The mean relative Ki67 reduction in patients experiencing vascular normalization in the ME-344 treated patients was 33%, compared to an increase of 11.8% in normalized patients from the bevacizumab monotherapy group (P=0.09). Approximately one-third of patients in each arm had vascular normalization.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Treatment was generally well tolerated; two Grade 3 adverse events of high blood pressure were reported, one in each arm. 
 Results from our earlier, first-in-human, single-agent Phase 1 clinical trial of ME-344 in patients with refractory solid tumors were published in the April 1, 2015 issue of Cancer. The results indicated that eight of 21 evaluable patients (38%) treated with ME-344 achieved stable disease or better, including five who experienced progression-free survival that was at least twice the duration of their last prior treatment before entry into the trial. In addition, one of these patients, a heavily pre-treated patient with small cell lung cancer, achieved a confirmed partial response and remained on study for two years. ME-344 was generally well tolerated at doses equal to or less than 10 mg/kg delivered on a weekly schedule for extended durations. Treatment-related adverse events included nausea, dizziness and fatigue. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed at both the 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose levels, consisting primarily of grade three peripheral neuropathy. 
 Pracinostat: HDAC Inhibitor Candidate in a Phase 3 Global Registration Clinical Trial 
 Pracinostat is an oral HDAC inhibitor being evaluated in a pivotal Phase 3 global registration clinical trial for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed AML who are unfit to receive intensive chemotherapy. Pracinostat is also being evaluated in a Phase 2 trial in patients with high or very high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license, development, manufacturing and commercialization agreement with Helsinn Healthcare SA, a Swiss pharmaceutical corporation (Helsinn) for pracinostat in AML, MDS and other potential indications (the Helsinn License Agreement). Under the agreement, Helsinn is primarily responsible for funding global development and commercialization costs for pracinostat. We are responsible for conducting the Phase 2 MDS trial, the cost of which is being shared equally with Helsinn. 
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation for pracinostat was granted by the FDA in 2016, and in January 2018 the EMA granted Orphan Drug Designation to pracinostat for the treatment of AML. The designations in the US and European Union (EU) are supported by data from a Phase 2 trial of pracinostat plus azacitidine (marketed as Vidaza®) in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML who are not candidates for induction chemotherapy. The trial showed a median overall survival of 19.1 months and a complete remission (CR) rate of 42% (21 of 50 patients). These data compare favorably to an international Phase 3 trial of azacitidine (AZA-001; Dombret et al. Blood. 2015 May 18), which showed a median overall survival of 10.4 months with azacitidine alone and a CR rate of 19.5% in a similar patient population. The combination of pracinostat and azacitidine was generally well tolerated, with no unexpected toxicities. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events included febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and fatigue. 
Pracinostat Scientific Overview; Epigenetics 
 HDACs play a key role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression by regulating chromatin structure. Acetylation of positively charged lysine residues present in histone proteins by the histone acetyltransferase (HATs) reduces the affinity between histones and negatively charged DNA, resulting in the opening of the chromatin structure. This makes it easier for the transcriptional machinery to access the DNA, enhancing RNA transcription. Conversely, deacetylation by the HDACs closes the chromatin structure leading to a repression of gene transcription. In normal cells, HDACs and HATs together control histone acetylation levels to maintain a balance. In diseases such as cancer, this regulation can be disturbed. HDAC inhibitors cause accumulation of acetylated histones, enhance transcription and result in changes to a variety of cellular responses including differentiation, proliferation, migration, survival and response to metabolic and hypoxic stress. In general, tumor cells are more susceptible than normal cells to the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of HDAC inhibitors. 
 There are currently three HDAC inhibitors, one oral and two injectable, approved by the FDA for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma and a fourth orally administered HDAC inhibitor approved for multiple myeloma. Other HDAC inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials as monotherapies and in combination for the treatment of various hematologic diseases and solid tumors.

 Pracinostat is an orally available, potent HDAC inhibitor with potentially improved physicochemical, pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic properties when compared to other compounds of this class, including increased bioavailability and increased half-life. 
 Clinical Program 
 The ongoing pivotal Phase 3 registration trial, which is being run by Helsinn and was initiated in June 2017, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will enroll worldwide approximately 500 adults with newly diagnosed AML who are unfit to receive intensive chemotherapy. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive pracinostat or placebo with azacitidine as background therapy. The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include morphologic CR rate, event-free survival and duration of CR. 
 Additionally, pracinostat is being investigated in a Phase 2 dose optimization trial evaluating patients with high and very high-risk MDS who are previously untreated with hypomethylating agents. This patient group represents the highest unmet need in MDS, with median survival estimates of 1.6 years and 0.8 years, respectively (Greenberg et al, Blood 2012). The ongoing Phase 2 open-label trial is evaluating a 45 mg dose of pracinostat in combination with the standard dose of azacitidine. The trial is designed to evaluate tolerability of the combination, with the intent of maintaining patient enrollment longer than in an earlier Phase 2 trial evaluating a 60 mg dose. A prolonged treatment may result in a systemic exposure to pracinostat and azacitidine sufficient to achieve the desired treatment effect; data from the earlier Phase 2 trial suggested that insufficient exposure to treatment may have limited the treatment effect of the combination. 
 A pre-planned interim analysis of the ongoing Phase 2 MDS trial demonstrated a 10% discontinuation rate among the first 20 evaluable patients treated, meeting the predefined threshold in the first 3 treatment cycles. The 10% rate is consistent with the discontinuation rate for azacitidine given as a monotherapy in earlier studies with pracinostat. Having met this threshold, the trial expanded open-label enrollment to a total of 60 patients in the study. An interim analysis presented at the 2018 ASH meeting demonstrated a discontinuation rate due to adverse events in the first 3 months of 4%, substantially lower than the rate of 26% reported in the Companys prior Phase 2 trial. The Phase 2 trial has completed enrollment and patients will be followed for one year to evaluate safety and efficacy. The primary endpoints of the trial are 1) safety and tolerability and 2) overall response rate, defined as CR, partial remission (PR) and marrow CR. Secondary endpoints include CR rate, overall hematologic improvement (HI) response rate, clinical benefit rate (defined as rate of CR + PR + HI + Marrow CR), rate of cytogenetic complete response/remission, duration of response, rate of leukemic transformation, event-free survival, progression-free survival and overall survival. If the Phase 2 open-label trial is successful, Helsinn intends to initiate a global registration trial. All future development and commercialization costs after the completion of the Phase 2 trial are the responsibility of Helsinn. 
 Pracinostat has been previously investigated in more than 300 patients in multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials and found to be generally well tolerated with manageable side effects often associated with drugs of this class, including fatigue, myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity. 
 Competition 
 The marketplace for our drug candidates is highly competitive. A number of other companies have products or drug candidates in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development that are intended for the same therapeutic indications for which our drug candidates are being developed. Some of these potential competing drug candidates are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized sooner. Even if we are successful in developing products that receive regulatory approval, such products may not compete successfully with products produced by our competitors or with products that may subsequently receive regulatory approval. 
 Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors developing oncology drugs have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization than we do. They compete with us in recruiting sites and eligible patients to participate in clinical studies and in attracting development and/or commercialization partners. They also license technologies that are competitive with our technologies. As a result, our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and products that would render our technologies or our drug candidates obsolete or non-competitive.Intellectual Property 
 We own, by assignment or exclusive license, worldwide rights to each of our current drug candidates. Our intellectual property portfolio includes approximately 21 issued U.S. patents, 164 issued foreign patents, 16 pending U.S. patent applications, and 68 pending foreign applications. 
 We have acquired, by assignment, worldwide rights to ME-401 and other related compounds from Pathway Therapeutics, Inc. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued four patents covering the composition of matter and pharmaceutical compositions of ME-401 which are projected to expire in January 2031 and December 2032, not including any patent term extension. There are currently nine U.S. and 23 foreign applications for ME-401 and related compounds pending.

 We have acquired exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize voruciclib from Presage Biosciences, Inc. (Presage). The USPTO has issued three patents covering the composition of matter and pharmaceutical compositions of voruciclib which are projected to expire between April 29, 2024 and September 2028, not including any patent term extension. 
 We have acquired, by assignment, patents and patent applications from Novogen, our former majority shareholder, which relate to a large family of isoflavonoid compounds, including ME-344. The USPTO has issued ten patents covering ME-344, including its composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use to treat cancer. The composition of matter and pharmaceutical composition claims covering ME-344 are expected to expire in March 2027 and November 2031, not including patent term extension. 
 We have acquired, by assignment, patents and patent applications from S*Bio Pte Ltd (S*Bio) relating to a family of heterocyclic compounds, which include pracinostat, that inhibit histone deacetylases. The USPTO has issued seven patents covering a number of these heterocyclic-based compounds, including pracinostat, and their composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of use to treat proliferative diseases. The composition of matter claims covering pracinostat are projected to expire in May 2028, not including patent term extension. In the Helsinn License Agreement, we granted to Helsinn an exclusive (subject to certain retained rights to perform obligations under the agreement), sublicensable, payment-bearing, license under and to certain patents and know-how controlled by us to develop, manufacture and commercialize pracinostat and any pharmaceutical product containing pracinostat for all human and animal indications. 
 Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies, compounds and information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection for our key inventions, including drug candidates we identify, routes for chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical formulations. There is no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue, or that any of our patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant product or method. In addition, we regularly review our patent portfolio to identify patents and patent applications that we deem to have relatively low value to our ongoing business operations for potential abandonment. There is also no assurance that we will correctly identify which of our patents and patent applications should be maintained and which should be abandoned. The term of most of our other current patents commenced, and most of our future patents, if any, will commence, on the date of issuance and terminate 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. Because any marketing and regulatory approval for a drug often occurs several years after the related patent application is filed, the resulting market exclusivity afforded by any patent on our drug candidates and technologies will likely be substantially less than 20 years. 
 As most patent applications in the U.S. are maintained as confidential until published by the USPTO at 18 months from filing for all cases filed after November 29, 2000, or at issue, for cases filed prior to November 29, 2000, we cannot be certain that we or Presage were the first to make the inventions covered by the patents and applications referred to above. Additionally, publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind the actual discoveries. Moreover, pursuant to the terms of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, patents filed on or after June 8, 1995 have a term of twenty years from the date of such filing except for provisional applications, irrespective of the period of time it may take for such patent to ultimately issue. This may shorten the period of patent protection afforded to therapeutic uses of ME-401, voruciclib, ME-344 or pracinostat as patent applications in the biopharmaceutical sector often take considerable time to issue. However, in some countries the patent term may be extended. 
 In order to protect the confidentiality of our technology, including trade secrets and know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, we require all of our consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into agreements that prohibit the use or disclosure of information that is deemed confidential. These agreements also oblige our consultants, advisors and collaborators to assign to us, or negotiate a license to developments, discoveries and inventions made by such persons in connection with their work relating to our products. We cannot be sure that confidentiality will be maintained by those from whom we have acquired technology or disclosure prevented by these agreements. We also cannot be sure that our proprietary information or intellectual property will be protected by these agreements or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or intellectual property. 
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and patents may have been applied for by, and issued to, other parties relating to products competitive with ME-401, voruciclib, ME-344 or pracinostat. Use of these compounds and any other drug candidates may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties, existing now and in the future. An adverse claim could subject us to significant liabilities to such other parties and/or require disputed rights to be licensed from such other parties. We cannot be sure that any license required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we may encounter delays in product market introductions, or may find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses may be precluded. 
 Research and Development 
 The objective of our research and development program is the generation of data sufficient to achieve regulatory approval of our drug candidates in one or more dosage forms in major markets such as the U.S., to meet medical needs and develop a clinical and commercial profile with attractive attributes, and/or to allow us to enter into a development and/or commercial relationship with another party. The data are generated by our pre-clinical studies and clinical trial programs.

 The key aspects of our research and development program are to provide more complete characterization of the following: 
 

 | the relevant molecular targets of action of our drug candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | the relative therapeutic benefits and indications for use of our drug candidates as a monotherapy or as part of combinational therapy with other agents; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the most appropriate therapeutic indications and dosage forms for ME-401, voruciclib, ME-344 and pracinostat.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation 
 U.S. Regulatory Requirements 
 The FDA, and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries, regulate and impose substantial requirements upon the research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, labeling, manufacture, quality control, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution and export of pharmaceutical products including biologics, as well as significant reporting and record-keeping obligations. State governments may also impose obligations in these and other areas. 
 In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and other laws, including in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. We believe, but cannot be certain, that our products will be regulated as drugs by the FDA. The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 
 

 | pre-clinical laboratory evaluations, including formulation and stability testing, and animal tests performed under the FDAs Good Laboratory Practices regulations to assess pharmacological activity and toxicity potential;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission and approval of an Investigational New Drug (IND), including results of pre-clinical tests, manufacturing information, and protocols for clinical tests, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin in the U.S.;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards (IRB), to administer the products to human subjects in clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for the products intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | development of manufacturing processes which conform to FDA current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), as confirmed by FDA inspection;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission of results for pre-clinical and clinical studies, and chemistry, manufacture and control information on the product to the FDA in a New Drug Approval Application (NDA); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of a NDA, prior to any commercial sale or shipment of a product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 The results of the pre-clinical studies, together with initial specified manufacturing information, the proposed clinical trial protocol, and information about the participating investigators are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may begin human clinical trials in the U.S. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with federal regulations and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, and with investigational products that follow cGMP. Additionally, an independent IRB must review and approve each study protocol and oversee conduct of the trial. An IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, the IND sponsor must resolve the FDAs concerns before clinical trials can begin. Pre-clinical tests and studies can take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND we submit based on such tests and studies will become effective within any specific time period, if at all. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
 

 | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety and dosage tolerance. Absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion testing is generally performed at this stage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2: The drug is studied in controlled, exploratory therapeutic trials in a limited number of subjects with the disease or medical condition for which the new drug is intended to be used in order to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the preliminary or potential efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or medical conditions, and to determine dosage tolerance and the optimal effective dose.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3: When Phase 2 studies demonstrate that a specific dosage range of the drug may be effective and the drug has an acceptable safety profile for further investigation, controlled, large-scale therapeutic Phase 3 trials are undertaken at multiple study sites to demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional non-clinical studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate. 
 We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete clinical testing of our products within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRB or we may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, as well as detailed information about the manufacturing process, quality control methods, and product composition, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA seeking approval to market and commercially distribute the product on the basis of a determination that the product is safe and effective for its intended use. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and may inspect clinical study sites at which the product candidate was studied and will not approve the product unless cGMP and GCP compliance is satisfactory. If applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, the FDA may deny the NDA or require

  additional testing or information. As a condition of approval, the FDA also may require post-marketing testing or surveillance to monitor the products safety or efficacy. The FDA also may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as a condition of product approval or following approval to ensure that the benefits of the product candidate outweigh the risks. Moreover, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications or populations for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a black box warning, impose other conditions, such as post-approval studies, or may not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing. Even after an NDA is approved, the FDA may impose additional obligations or restrictions (such as labeling changes, or clinical post-marketing requirements), or even suspend or withdraw a product approval on the basis of data that arise after the product reaches the market, or if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained. We cannot be certain that any NDA we submit will be approved by the FDA for full or accelerated approval on a timely basis, if at all. Also, any such approval may limit the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. Any refusal to approve, delay in approval, suspension or withdrawal of approval, or restrictions on indicated uses could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects. 
 Each NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee, pursuant to the requirements of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), and its amendments. Following product approval, drug products are also subject to annual program fees. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. A written request can be submitted for a waiver for the application fee for the first human drug application that is filed by a small business, but there are no small business waivers for program fees. Product candidates that are designated as orphan products are not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication and may be exempt from program fees if certain criteria are met. We are not at the stage of development with our products where we are subject to these fees, but they are significant expenditures that may be incurred in the future and must be paid at the time of application submissions to the FDA. 
 Satisfaction of FDA requirements typically takes many years. The actual time required varies substantially, based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the pharmaceutical product, among other things. Government regulation imposes costly and time-consuming requirements and restrictions throughout the product life cycle and may delay product marketing for a considerable period of time, limit product marketing, or prevent marketing altogether. Success in pre-clinical or early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent marketing approval. Even if a product receives marketing approval, the approval is limited to specific clinical indications. Further, even after marketing approval is obtained, the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. 
 After product approval, there are continuing significant regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements, obligations to report adverse side effects in patients using the products, and restrictions on advertising and promotional activities. Quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs, and the FDA periodically inspects facilities to assess cGMP compliance. Additionally, post-approval changes in ingredient composition, manufacturing processes or facilities, product labeling, or other areas may require submission of a NDA Supplement to the FDA for review and approval. New indications will require additional clinical studies and submission of a NDA Supplement. 
 Failure to comply with FDA regulatory requirements may result in an enforcement action by the FDA, including clinical holds, refusal to approve marketing applications or supplements, Warning Letters, product recalls, suspension or revocation of product approval, seizure of product to prevent distribution, impositions of injunctions prohibiting product manufacture or distribution, and civil and criminal penalties, among other actions. Maintaining compliance is costly and time-consuming. We cannot be certain that we, or our present or future suppliers or third-party manufacturers, will be able to comply with all FDA regulatory requirements, and potential consequences of noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects. 
 The FDAs policies may change, and additional governmental regulations may be enacted that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval of our products or affect our ability to manufacture, market, or distribute our products after approval. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of healthcare costs in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to commercialize future products will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other third-party payers. European Union member states and U.S. government and other third-party payers increasingly are attempting to contain healthcare costs by consideration of new laws and regulations limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs. Our failure to obtain coverage, an adequate level of reimbursement, or acceptable prices for our future products could diminish any revenues we may be able to generate. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. 
 Our activities also may be subject to state laws and regulations that affect our ability to develop and sell our products. We are also subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, clinical, laboratory, and manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future, and the failure to comply may have a material adverse impact on our business prospects. 
 The FDCA includes provisions designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs and biological products intended for treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such conditions. These provisions set forth a procedure for designation of a drug as a fast track product. The fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and specific indication for which it is being studied. A product designated as fast track is ordinarily eligible for additional programs for expediting development and review, such as increased FDA interactions and rolling submission and review of the application. Products that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may also be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug approval under the accelerated approval regulations may be based on evidence of clinical effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. A post-marketing clinical study will be required to verify clinical benefit, and other restrictions to assure safe use may be imposed. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug or biologic from the market on an expedited basis. A third potential designation that may be available is breakthrough therapy designation. A breakthrough therapy is a product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Products designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for intensive FDA guidance, a commitment from the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative and cross-disciplinary review, rolling submission and review of the application, and the facilitation of cross-disciplinary review. Finally, if a product is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of the condition, the product may be eligible for priority review meaning that FDAs goal for the review of an NDA is shortened to six months from FDAs acceptance of the application, rather than the standard review of ten months from application acceptance. We do not currently have fast track designation for any of our clinical programs. If we should seek such designation for any of our programs, however, we cannot be assured that it will be granted by the FDA. There is also no guarantee that we will be able to maintain any designation that we may receive.

 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, a sponsor may obtain marketing exclusivity for a specified period of time following FDA approval of certain drug applications, regardless of patent status, if the drug is a new chemical entity or if new clinical studies, that are not bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, were required to support the marketing application for the drug. This marketing exclusivity generally prevents a third party from obtaining FDA approval for an identical or nearly identical drug under an Abbreviated New Drug Application or a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application. The period of the marketing exclusivity and the specific effect differs depending on whether the exclusivity is based upon a drugs new chemical entity status or whether it is based on the conduct of new clinical studies. The marketing exclusivity, however, is not absolute. For example, marketing exclusivity will not prevent FDA from approving full NDAs. Following NDA approval, the statute also allows a patent owner to obtain an extension of a single unexpired patent that has not previously been extended for a period equal to one-half the period of time elapsed between the filing of an IND and the filing of the corresponding NDA plus the period of time between the filing of the NDA and FDA approval, with a five year maximum patent extension. The total patent life of the product with the extension cannot exceed fourteen years from the products approval date. The period of patent extension may also be reduced for any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence. We cannot be certain that we will be able to take advantage of either the patent term extension or marketing exclusivity provisions of these laws or that, if received, they will adequately protect any approved products from competition. 
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), signed into law on January 4, 2002, was reauthorized and amended by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA). The reauthorization of BPCA adds an additional six months of marketing exclusivity and patent protection to unexpired exclusivities and unexpired patents listed with FDA for NDA applicants that conduct acceptable pediatric studies of new and currently-marketed drug products for which pediatric information would be beneficial, as identified by the FDA in a Pediatric Written Request. The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), signed into law on December 3, 2003, also was reauthorized and amended by the FDAAA. The reauthorization of PREA requires that most applications for drugs and biologics include a pediatric assessment (unless waived or deferred) to ensure the drugs and biologics safety and effectiveness in children. Such pediatric assessment must contain data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the assessment is required, that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or the biological product is safe and effective. The pediatric assessments can only be deferred provided there is a timeline for the completion of such studies. The FDA may waive (partially or fully) the pediatric assessment requirement for several reasons, including if the applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed. Orphan products are also exempt from the PREA requirements. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act signed into law on July 9, 2012, permanently renewed and strengthened BPCA and PREA. 
 Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, beginning in 2020, sponsors submitting applications for product candidates intended for the treatment of adult cancer which are directed at molecular targets that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of pediatric cancer must submit, with the application, reports from molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigations designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data, using appropriate formulations, to inform potential pediatric labeling. While orphan products are not exempt from this requirement, the FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances. Pracinostat has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of AML, but it may not receive orphan designation for other indications. Our other products may not be eligible for orphan drug status or be designated as orphan drugs. Even if designated as orphan drugs, our products may not be approved before other applications or granted orphan drug exclusivity if approved. 
 Foreign Regulatory Requirements 
 Outside the U.S., our ability to market our products will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities and compliance with applicable post-approval regulatory requirements. Although the specific requirements and restrictions vary from country to country, as a general matter, foreign regulatory systems include risks similar to those associated with FDA regulation, described above. 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or a decentralized procedure (DCP). Under the centralized procedure, a single application to the EMA leads to an approval granted by the European Commission which permits the marketing of the product throughout the EU. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain classes of medicinal products, but optional for others. For example, all medicinal products developed by certain biotechnological means, and those developed for cancer and other specified diseases and disorders, must be authorized via the centralized procedure. The centralized procedure will apply to any of our products that are developed by means of a biotechnology process or are intended for treatment of cancer. The DCP is used for products that are not required to be authorized by the centralized procedure. Under the DCP (where there is no pre-existing marketing authorization granted by one member state) or mutual recognition procedure (MRP) an application for a marketing authorization is submitted to the competent authority of one member state of the EU (the reference member state). The holders of a national marketing authorization may submit further applications to the competent authorities of any or all the remaining member states (the concerned member states). The DCP enables applicants to submit an identical application to the competent authorities of all member states where approval is sought at the same time as the first application, while under the MRP, products are authorized initially in one member state, and other member states where approval is sought are then requested to recognize the original authorization based upon an assessment report prepared by the original authorizing competent authority. Under the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures, the reference member state assessment takes 210 days (MRP) or 120 days (DCP) and the concerned member states process should take no longer than 90 days. However, if one member state makes an objection, which under the legislation can only be based on a possible risk to human health, the application will be automatically referred to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA. If a referral for arbitration is made, the procedure is suspended. However, member states that have already approved the application may, at the request of the applicant, authorize the product in question without waiting for the result of the arbitration. Such authorizations will be without prejudice to the outcome of the arbitration. For all other concerned member states, the opinion of the CHMP, which is binding, could support or reject the objection or alternatively could reach a compromise position acceptable to all EU countries concerned. The arbitration procedure may take an additional year before a final decision is reached and may require the delivery of additional data.

 As with FDA approval, we may not be able to secure regulatory approvals in the EU in a timely manner, if at all. Additionally, as in the U.S., post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution, would apply to any product that is approved in the EU, and failure to comply with such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize any product. 
 The conduct of clinical trials in the European Union is governed by the European Clinical Trials Directive, which was implemented in May 2004. This Directive governs how regulatory bodies in member states control clinical trials. No clinical trial may be started without a clinical trial authorization granted by the national competent authority and favorable ethics approval. New legislation to revise and replace the European Clinical Trials Directive has been passed but is not yet implemented (currently estimated for 2020). 
 Accordingly, there is a marked degree of change and uncertainty both in the regulation of clinical trials and in respect of marketing authorizations which we face for our products in the EU. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have the facilities or capabilities to commercially manufacture any of our drug candidates. We are and expect to continue to be dependent on contract manufacturers for supplying our existing and future candidates for clinical trials and commercial scale manufacturing of our candidates in accordance with regulatory requirements, including cGMP. Contract manufacturers may utilize their own technology, technology developed by us, or technology acquired or licensed from third parties. FDA approval of the manufacturing procedures and the site will be required prior to commercial distribution. 
Employees 
 As of June 30, 2019, we had 40 employees, 13 of whom hold a Ph.D. or M.D. degree. Other personnel resources are used from time to time as consultants or third party service organizations on an as-needed basis. All members of our senior management team have prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced personnel, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the individuals needed. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced work stoppages. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 
Available Information 
 Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge through our website at www.meipharma.com as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
