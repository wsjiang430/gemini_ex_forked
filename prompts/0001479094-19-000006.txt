Item 1.  Business
Certain Definitions
In this report:
We define "GAAP" as generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
We define "total annualized base rental revenue" as the contractual monthly base rent as of December 31, 2018 (which differs from rent calculated in accordance with GAAP) multiplied by 12. If a tenant is in a free rent period as of December 31, 2018, the total annualized base rental revenue is calculated based on the first contractual monthly base rent amount multiplied by 12.
We define "occupancy rate" as the percentage of total leasable square footage for which either revenue recognition has commenced in accordance with GAAP or the lease term has commenced as of the close of the reporting period, whichever occurs earlier.
We define the "Value Add Portfolio" as properties that meet any of the following criteria: (i) less than 75% occupied as of the acquisition date; (ii) will be less than 75% occupied due to known move-outs within two years of the acquisition date; or (iii) out of service with significant physical renovation of the asset.
We define "Stabilization" for properties being redeveloped as the earlier of achieving 90% occupancy or 12 months after completion. With respect to properties acquired and immediately added to the Value Add Portfolio, (i) if acquired with less than 75% occupancy as of the acquisition date, Stabilization will occur upon the earlier of achieving 90% occupancy or 12 months from the acquisition date; or (ii) if acquired and will be less than 75% occupied due to known move-outs within two years of the acquisition date, Stabilization will occur upon the earlier of achieving 90% occupancy after the known move-outs have occurred or 12 months after the known move-outs have occurred.
We define the "Operating Portfolio" as all warehouse and light manufacturing assets that were acquired stabilized or have achieved Stabilization. The Operating Portfolio excludes non-core flex/office assets and assets contained in the Value Add Portfolio.
We define a "Comparable Lease" as a lease in the same space with a similar lease structure as compared to the previous in-place lease, excluding new leases for space that was not occupied under our ownership.
We define "SL Rent Change" as the percentage change in the average monthly base rent over the term of the lease, calculated on a straight-line basis, of the lease executed during the period compared to the Comparable Lease for assets included in the Operating Portfolio. Rent under gross or similar type leases are converted to a net rent based on an estimate of the applicable recoverable expenses, and this calculation excludes the impact of any holdover rent.
4

We define "Cash Rent Change" as the percentage change in the base rent of the lease executed during the period compared to the base rent of the Comparable Lease for assets included in the Operating Portfolio. The calculation compares the first base rent payment due after the lease commencement date compared to the base rent of the last monthly payment due prior to the termination of the lease, excluding holdover rent. Rent under gross or similar type leases are converted to a net rent based on an estimate of the applicable recoverable expenses.
Overview
We are a REIT focused on the acquisition, ownership and operation of single-tenant, industrial properties throughout the United States. We seek to (i) identify properties for acquisition that offer relative value across all locations, industrial property types, and tenants through the principled application of our proprietary risk assessment model, (ii) operate our properties in an efficient, cost-effective manner, and (iii) capitalize our business appropriately given the characteristics of our assets. We are a Maryland corporation and our common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “STAG.”
We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and generally are not subject to federal income tax to the extent we currently distribute our income to our stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.  We remain subject to state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 390 buildings in 37 states with approximately 76.8 million rentable square feet, consisting of 320 warehouse/distribution buildings, 58 light manufacturing buildings, nine flex/office buildings, and three Value Add Portfolio buildings. We own both single- and multi-tenant properties, although we focus on the former. As of December 31, 2018, our buildings were approximately 95.5% leased to 349 tenants, with no single tenant accounting for more than approximately 2.3% of our total annualized base rental revenue and no single industry accounting for more than approximately 15.0% of our total annualized base rental revenue. We intend to maintain a diversified mix of tenants to limit our exposure to any single tenant. 
As of December 31, 2018, our Operating Portfolio was approximately 95.8% leased and our SL Rent Change (as defined below) on new and renewal leases together grew approximately 15.2% and 10.8% during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively and our Cash Rent Change on new and renewal leases together grew approximately 7.9% and 2.9% during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We have a fully-integrated acquisition, leasing and asset management platform, and our senior management team has a significant amount of single-tenant, industrial real estate experience. Our mission is to continue to be a disciplined, relative value investor and a leading owner and operator of single-tenant, industrial properties in the United States.  We seek to deliver attractive stockholder returns in all market environments by providing a covered dividend combined with accretive growth.
We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT, also known as an UPREIT, and own all of our properties and conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership, which we control and manage. As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 96.5% of the common equity of our Operating Partnership, and our current and former executive officers, directors, senior employees and their affiliates, and third parties who contributed properties to us in exchange for common equity in our Operating Partnership, owned the remaining 3.5%. We completed our initial public offering of common stock and related formation transactions, pursuant to which we succeeded our predecessor, on April 20, 2011.
Our Strategy
Our primary business objectives are to own and operate a balanced and diversified portfolio of binary risk investments (individual single-tenant industrial properties) that maximize cash flows available for distribution to our stockholders, and to enhance stockholder value over time by achieving sustainable long-term growth in distributable cash flow from operations per share. 
We believe that our focus on owning and operating a portfolio of individually-acquired, single-tenant industrial properties throughout the United States will, when compared to other real estate portfolios, generate returns for our stockholders that are attractive in light of the associated risks for the following reasons.

• | Buyers tend to price an individual, single-tenant, industrial property according to the binary nature of its cash flows; with only one potential tenant, any one property is either generating revenue or not. Furthermore, tenants typically cover operating expenses at a property and when a property is not generating revenue, we, as owners, are responsible for paying these expenses. We believe the market prices these properties are based upon a higher risk profile due to the single-tenant nature of these properties and therefore applies a lower value relative to a diversified cash flowing investment.

• | The acquisition and contribution of these single-tenant properties to an aggregated portfolio of these individual binary risk cash flows creates diversification, thereby lowering risk and creating value.


• | Industrial properties generally require less capital expenditure than other commercial property types and single-tenant properties generally require less expenditure for leasing, operating and capital costs per property than multi-tenant properties.


• | Other institutional, industrial real estate buyers tend to focus on larger properties and portfolios in a select few primary markets. In contrast, we focus on smaller, individual properties across many markets. As a result, our typical competitors are local investors who often do not have the same access to debt or equity capital as us. In our fragmented, predominantly non-institutional environment, a sophisticated, institutional platform with access to capital has execution and operational advantages.

Our focus on single-tenant properties is not exclusive; we also own multi-tenant properties, as a result of acquiring properties with more than one tenant or of originally single-tenant properties re-leasing to multiple tenants. 
Regulation
General
Our properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that we and/or our tenants, as applicable, have the necessary permits and approvals to operate each of our properties.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the “ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined under the ADA. Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. Although we believe that the properties in our portfolio in the aggregate substantially comply with current requirements of the ADA, and we have not received any notice for correction from any regulatory agency, we have not conducted a comprehensive audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine whether we are in compliance and therefore we may own properties that are not in compliance with the ADA.
ADA compliance is dependent upon the tenant’s specific use of the property, and as the use of a property changes or improvements to existing spaces are made, we will take steps to ensure compliance. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in additional costs to attain compliance, imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages or attorney’s fees to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations to achieve compliance as necessary.
Environmental Matters
Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws. Under these laws, courts and government agencies have the authority to require us, as owner of a contaminated property, to clean up the property, even if we did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination. These laws also apply to persons who owned a property at the time it became contaminated, and therefore it is possible we could incur these costs even after we sell some of our properties. In addition to the costs of cleanup, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owner’s ability to borrow using the property as collateral or to sell the property. Under applicable environmental laws, courts and government agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, pay for the clean-up of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment. We invest in properties historically used for industrial, light manufacturing and commercial purposes. Certain of our properties are on or are adjacent to or near other properties upon which others, including former owners or tenants of our properties have engaged, or may in the future engage, in activities that may generate or release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances.
Environmental laws in the United States also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our buildings are known to have asbestos containing materials, and others, due to the age of the building and observed conditions, 
6

are suspected of having asbestos containing materials. We do not believe these conditions will materially and adversely affect us.  In most or all instances, no immediate action was recommended to address the conditions.
Furthermore, various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination. For instance, a person exposed to asbestos at one of our properties may seek to recover damages if he or she suffers injury from the asbestos. Lastly, some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities. An example would be laws that require a business using chemicals to manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used.
We could be responsible for any of the costs discussed above. The costs to clean up a contaminated property, to defend against a claim, or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could adversely affect the funds available for distribution to our stockholders. All of our properties were subject to a Phase I or similar environmental assessment by independent environmental consultants at the time of acquisition. We generally expect to continue to obtain a Phase I or similar environmental assessment by independent environmental consultants on each property prior to acquiring it. However, these environmental assessments may not reveal all environmental costs that might have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, results of operations or liquidity and may not identify all potential environmental liabilities.
At the time of acquisition, we add each property to our portfolio environmental insurance policy that provides coverage for potential environmental liabilities, subject to the policy’s coverage conditions and limitations.
We can make no assurances that future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose material environmental liabilities on us, or the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by tenants, the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to us.
Insurance
We carry comprehensive general liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket insurance policy. In addition, we maintain a portfolio environmental insurance policy that provides coverage for potential environmental liabilities, subject to the policy’s coverage conditions and limitations. Generally, we do not carry insurance for certain losses, including, but not limited to, losses caused by floods (unless the property is located in a flood plain), earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots. We carry employment practices liability insurance that covers us against claims by employees, former employees or potential employees for various employment related matters including wrongful termination, discrimination, sexual harassment in the workplace, hostile work environment, and retaliation, subject to the policy’s coverage conditions and limitations. We carry comprehensive cyber liability insurance coverage that covers us against claims related to certain first party and third party losses including data restoration costs, crisis management expenses, credit monitoring costs, failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures, invasion of customer’s privacy and negligence, subject to the policy’s coverage conditions and limitations. We also carry directors and officers insurance. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and standard industry practice; however, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses. 
Competition
In acquiring our target properties, we compete primarily with local individuals or local operators due to the smaller, single asset (versus portfolio) focus of our acquisition strategy. From time to time we compete with other public industrial property sector REITs, single-tenant REITs, income oriented non-traded REITs, and private real estate funds. Local real estate investors historically have represented our predominant competition for deals and they typically do not have the same access to capital that we do as a publicly traded institution. We also face significant competition from owners and managers of competing properties in leasing our properties to prospective tenants and in re-leasing space to existing tenants.
Operating Segments
We manage our operations on an aggregated, single segment basis for purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions, and accordingly, have only one reporting and operating segment. See Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under “Segment Reporting.”
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 73 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.

Our Corporate Structure
We were incorporated in Maryland on July 21, 2010, and our Operating Partnership was formed as a Delaware limited partnership on December 21, 2009.
We are structured as an UPREIT; our publicly-traded entity, STAG Industrial, Inc., is the REIT in the UPREIT structure, and our Operating Partnership is the umbrella partnership. We own a majority, but not all, of the Operating Partnership. We also wholly own the sole general partner (the manager) of the Operating Partnership. Substantially all of our assets are held in, and substantially all of our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. Shares of our common stock are traded on the NYSE under the symbol "STAG." The limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, which we sometimes refer to as “common units,” are not and cannot be publicly traded, although they may provide liquidity through an exchange feature described below. Our UPREIT structure allows us to acquire properties on a tax-deferred basis by issuing common units in exchange for the property.
The common units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership correlate on a one-for-one economic basis to the shares of common stock in the REIT. Each common unit receives the same distribution as a share of our common stock, the value of each common unit is tied to the value of a share of our common stock and each common unit, after one year, generally may be redeemed (that is, exchanged) for cash in an amount equivalent to the value of a share of common stock or, if we choose, for a share of common stock on a one-for-one basis. When redeeming common units for cash, the value of a share of common stock is calculated as the average common stock closing price on the NYSE for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the redemption notice date.
