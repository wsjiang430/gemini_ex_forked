Item 1. Business
Overview
Enfusion is a global, high-growth, software-as-a-service, or SaaS, provider focused on transforming the investment management industry. The products and services that comprise our solution are designed to eliminate technology and information barriers, empowering investment managers to confidently make and execute better-informed investment decisions in real time. We simplify investment and operational workflows by unifying mission-critical systems and coalescing data into a single dataset resulting in a single source of truth. This allows stakeholders throughout the entire client organization to interact more effectively with one another across the investment management lifecycle.
We believe, by means of our purposefully-designed, interconnected systems underpinned by one dataset, we are the only solution that allows clients to see and interact with all parts of the investment management lifecycle, ranging from portfolio construction, trading, risk management, accounting and operations through to investor reporting, seamlessly in real time, in one screen, in one solution. As a result, our solution enables clients to better align teams, optimizing their investment decision-making, operations and technology footprint and lowering operating costs. By harnessing the efficiencies, agility and scale inherent to our cloud-native, multi-tenant software that is integrated with a suite of technology-powered, managed services, we believe we have created the industry’s most compelling investment management solution, capable of shaping and addressing the evolving demands of the global investment management landscape.
Existing solutions in the investment management technology industry include a patchwork of “task-specific” point solutions from disparate vendors, technology stitched together through acquisitions, internally-developed technology, as well as cost-prohibitive solutions accessible only to the largest investment managers. Where available solutions are cloud-enabled, many were originally designed for on-premises installations and subsequently individually migrated to the cloud via discrete code streams, retaining single-tenant infrastructure limitations that require changes to be made for each client individually instead of delivering changes to all clients simultaneously and leading to laborious and costly maintenance and difficult security requirements. As a result, many investment managers spend considerable time and resources managing legacy, stitched together, or disparate systems, fragmented data, complex communication networks and cumbersome workflows. Designed for the cloud from inception, Enfusion provides a flexible and simplified end-to-end alternative that allows investment managers to focus their time and resources on investment performance. This enables us to build long-term partnerships with our clients, offering a solution that is not only tailored to meet their business needs today, but also has the depth and breadth of capability to support them as they grow or enter new markets or asset classes.
Our cloud-native, multi-tenant solution provides:

● | Seamless unification and simplification of workflows provided through one cohesive solution;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A robust, real-time view of a client’s business that can be displayed through countless reports and utilized across client personnel that depend on one another, but have different roles throughout the organization;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inherent scalability and extensive integrations via client, third party and proprietary interfaces and APIs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Weekly, functional enhancements provided to all clients, eliminating complicated upgrade and version control issues and providing the agility to meet rapidly evolving industry needs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced operational risk through granular, user-defined access controls and governance capabilities; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Anywhere access across the desktop, the web and mobile devices.

Enfusion’s comprehensive solution cohesively addresses the core components of the investment lifecycle. Our portfolio management system gives clients the ability to construct and analyze portfolios and performance metrics with granularity, enabling better-informed investment decision-making. Once trade decisions are made, clients use our combined order and execution management systems to obtain market insights, run compliance checks and send electronic trade orders directly to executing brokers and exchanges. When orders are executed, execution data flows back to our solution and instantly feeds our systems, including our accounting system, enabling clients to produce a full set of financial statements in real time. The data also feeds our extensive reporting and analytics capabilities, allowing stakeholders across client organizations, including executive management, investment teams, operational support, compliance and investor relations, to obtain differentiating insights into their investment activities and better analyze investment performance. The purposefully-designed interconnectedness of our systems removes the need for manual data processing and validating across workflows. Coupled with market data and aggregated transactional and derived data provided to or received from a full suite of a client’s supporting parties, our solution creates a single dataset and source of truth that gives our clients a real-time, comprehensive and consistent view of their data across the investment lifecycle. Altogether, our full lifecycle, single-dataset investment management solution provides investment managers with a tailored suite of tools and investment content to make better-informed decisions, faster and with greater confidence, in one screen and one solution.
In addition to facilitating the full investment lifecycle, our robust and agile solution allows us to serve a diverse client base that ranges in investment strategies, size and geography. Our clients include alternative investment managers such as hedge funds of all types, private equity funds, family offices and corporate investment arms, as well as institutional investment managers such as traditional asset managers and mutual funds:

● | Alternative Investment Managers – We enable alternative investment management clients to achieve scale efficiently, instill investor confidence, easily expand into new strategies, asset classes or geographies and significantly increase their speed to market. Clients can interact with the entire investment management lifecycle on one solution, unified by one dataset and are not burdened by costly hardware requirements or disruptive software upgrades. We generally deliver weekly upgrades through our cloud-native, multi-tenant solution, allowing us to continuously innovate and quickly adapt to meet ever-evolving client needs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Institutional Investment Managers – We deliver an intelligent solution that can replace or supplement institutional investment management clients’ legacy systems and can be utilized as a unifying hub across other existing systems, improving our clients’ operational inefficiencies and providing access to more relevant and simplified workflows and technologies. This intelligent solution gives large, less-agile clients the ability to replace their existing systems at their own pace, as they become better positioned to reduce their costly and inefficient legacy technology dependencies.

The Enfusion Solution
Our cloud-native, purposefully-designed, end-to-end solution gives our clients the ability to easily access and analyze investment information in real time, perform complex calculations quickly and interact with markets electronically adding up to better, more informed investment decisions and actions. Our solution is highly configurable to different work streams, client segments and asset classes. Rather than relying on large, specialized workforces necessary for local or tenant-by-tenant deployments, modifications to our solution are made remotely within one code-base and without client intervention or interaction. Software enhancements developed for individual, sponsoring clients are made available to all clients at the same time. This process, where our community of clients continuously contributes to the ever-evolving nature of our solution, strengthens the value of the solution to all of our clients. Further, Enfusion’s open and flexible architecture easily integrates into clients’ existing technology stacks via APIs and other connectivity and is adaptable to our clients’ existing internal and third-party systems. With a limited footprint, wide-ranging use-cases and ‘anywhere’ access across multiple mediums, our solution increasingly serves as the operational epicenter for our clients.
Our solution, comprised of mission critical systems integrated with a suite of technology-powered, managed services, serves the full investment lifecycle, driving better insights into and control over the business activities of the investment manager and investment operations. We recognize that, despite increasing market pressures to the contrary, some clients may not be in a position to replace all of their systems at once. Therefore, we have designed our solution to allow our clients to use some or all of our solution to manage their investment lifecycle workflow and also to augment or 

6



integrate into their existing workflows or systems, giving them the flexibility to expand their usage and us the ability to solve their unique needs through time.
​
Our solution is utilized by a variety of users including portfolio managers, traders, compliance officers, operational support staff and executive management, all of whom benefit from role-based functionality underpinned by a single dataset. This single dataset enables each of these users to generate valuable insights while operating on the same real-time information governed by appropriate access controls. The end-to-end functionality our solution provides is detailed below:


● | Portfolio Management System, or PMS: Able to comprehensively construct and re-balance investment portfolios, this system generates a real-time investment book of record, or IBOR, for CIOs and portfolio managers, features a full suite of valuation and risk tools and allows users to analyze aggregated or decomposed portfolio data by any number of customizable dimensions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Order and Execution Management System, or OEMS: Intertwined with our PMS, this module offers portfolio managers, traders, compliance teams and analysts the ability to electronically communicate trade orders for a variety of asset classes and with a choice of hundreds of executing counterparties globally, manage trade orders and systemically enforce trading regulations and internal guidelines.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accounting/General Ledger System: Underpinning our PMS and OEMS systems, our accounting system features a proper double-entry ledger that automates the posting of general ledger journal entries for all cash and securities transactions directly from our PMS—providing CFOs, COOs, accountants and operations teams a complete, real-time accounting book of record, or ABOR.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enfusion Analytics System: Connected in real time with our PMS and OEMS, Enfusion Analytics system enables CIOs, portfolio managers, traders and analysts to utilize the solution’s comprehensive client data insights to analyze portfolios through time horizons and automate customized visualized reports for both
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

internal and external stakeholders. This module also acts as a centralized data warehouse that may be accessed or utilized by both individual and systematic users.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Technology-Powered, Managed Services: We offer access to technology-powered, managed services designed to maximize the power of the Enfusion solution. By using expert teams empowered by technology to address time-consuming front-, middle- and back-office administrative tasks related to the investment lifecycle such as performing various fund and position level reconciliations, processing corporate actions, proactive trade break resolutions, and back up accounting against fund administrators, our clients are able to focus on their highest-value business activities and recognize the full benefit of our solution.

Our Market Opportunity
Investment managers spend significant time and resources supporting their business processes, which is intensifying as their industry continues to become more complex and subject to unprecedented pace of change. It is critical that investment managers have the tools to confidently make and execute upon better-informed investment decisions in real time and, in turn, remain competitive. Accordingly, the demand for a comprehensive investment lifecycle, cloud-native solution that simplifies workflows by unifying mission-critical systems and coalescing data into a single dataset will continue to increase.
The Enfusion solution, comprised of mission-critical systems integrated with a suite of technology-powered, managed services, is designed to eliminate the inherent constraints and maintenance demands tied to managing legacy and disparate technology as well as aggregating and validating data across workflows, allowing our clients to focus on innovation and investment returns. Our flexible architecture, built on a single codebase, gives us the ability to provide weekly software upgrades with improvements and new capabilities and, in turn, allows us to match the unprecedented pace of change and continuously evolve to meet our clients’ needs.
We believe there is a significant opportunity for us to replace competing legacy products as well as in-house proprietary technology. Our solution provides clients with flexibility to augment their existing systems, replace all legacy systems at once, or to take a more gradual approach, initially utilizing one system or limited parts of our solution and then gradually expanding utilization. Our solution is built for plug-and-play integration, with flexible APIs and other forms of connectivity that make it easy for clients to connect with other solutions or supporting parties.
Our Clients and Client Service
Enfusion has a diverse, global client base of 819 clients as of December 31, 2022, ranging from alternative investment managers such as hedge funds of all types, family offices and corporate investment arms, to institutional investment managers such as traditional investment managers, and mutual funds. Our client base spans our geographic reach; as of December 31, 2022, 57% of clients are from the Americas, 28% are from APAC, and 15% are from EMEA.
Our client-centric approach is embedded in the operating ethos across Enfusion. Our most important goal is to hold a high standard that couples both excellent ongoing innovation and excellent client experience. We believe our client-centric approach differentiates Enfusion and is made possible by our solution’s nimble, single-codebase architecture that is delivered in a one-to-many manner. In practice, our structure allows us to dedicate resources to our clients holistically, driving a superior client experience from the point of identifying a sales opportunity to product and services implementation and continuing throughout the client relationship. By providing dedicated continuity in the servicing team assigned to each client, we are able to ensure that our clients are continuously interfacing with familiar Enfusion employees that understand their business, workflows, daily needs and product use leading to increased efficiency and improved client experience. We also provide dedicated support teams and 24-hour, follow-the-sun support, six days a week, to all of our clients and with no additional charge.
Our Revenue Model
We derive the vast majority of our total revenues (98.9%, 98.8% and 98.0% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively) from our recurring subscription-based revenues. Client subscription fees are

comprised of various components such as user fees, connectivity fees, market data fees and technology-powered, managed services fees, all of which take into account client size, complexity, and growth. The weekly enhancements and upgrades that we deliver and the dedicated client service are included in the price of the contract.
Historically, our subscription contracts have typically had a term of one year and a 30-day cancellation clause, though our more recent contracts have typically been for multi-year terms and do not allow cancellation for convenience. Invoicing typically occurs in monthly installments at the end of each month during the subscription period. 
Our Growth Strategy
We continue to advance our position as a leading technology partner to the investment management industry. The key components of our growth strategy include:

● | Continue Broadening Our Client Base: There are significant opportunities to expand our client base across the various client segments we serve today. We believe we are the leading cloud-native, SaaS provider to the global hedge fund sector and expect that as the alternative investment sector grows, we will continue to extend our position. In addition, we continue to extend this growth through increasing adoption by larger institutional asset management clients due to increasing acceptance of cloud technology and the robust capabilities of our solution that better meet their evolving needs and address their existing pain points. The proportion of new client signings from established investment managers replacing competitor or internal systems was 64% for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 58% and 41% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, demonstrating increased new client activity from established firms versus newly launched funds. Taking advantage of the unique position that allows us to sell our products and services through shorter sales cycles and on faster client implementation timelines, we continue to expand our sales efforts to aggressively capitalize on opportunities in this client segment. Our success in signing new clients is also supported by referrals from our existing clients, client stakeholders when they transition to other or launch new organizations, industry channel partners and our global, strategic partners and alliances.

● | Expanding Relationships with Existing Clients: We believe there is a significant opportunity to further expand our relationships with existing clients as they continue to evolve and grow in size and expand into new markets and strategies or as we provide new functionality or release new systems, features, or services. We also believe we have a significant opportunity to expand our relationship with existing clients that were not in a position to replace all of their systems at once when they first engaged with us. For those clients that elect to initially utilize some portion of our solution or only use our solution for a particular strategy or fund, we find that once they experience the advantages of our end-to-end solution, many seek opportunities to expand the breadth of their relationship with us to further help improve their investment management workflows and technology infrastructure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ongoing Pace of Innovation: To retain and expand our client base, we continuously evaluate opportunities to advance our solution through increased breadth and depth of functionality to enrich overall experience and better enable our clients to achieve their investment goals and solve for a broad array of business, operational and technology challenges. We invest heavily in innovation and, on a weekly basis, deliver enhancements and added functionality based on our ongoing dialogues with our clients and consistent with our commitment to grow and evolve with our clients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Geographic Expansion: We believe there are attractive, untapped opportunities across various geographies within which we can expand our business. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 63% and 65% of our total revenues were generated in the Americas and 37% and 35% were generated outside of the Americas, respectively. We are globally situated in ten offices in Chicago, New York, São Paulo, London, Dublin, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, Mumbai and Bengaluru. We continue to invest in expanding our presence and capitalize on opportunities in markets such as Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific, where we opened an Australian office in 2021. In 2022, we signed 174 clients across the world, representing an 12% increase in total clients from 2021.

● | Selectively Pursue Acquisitions: We may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies that improve and accelerate our ability to deliver world-class investment management products and services and excellent client experience.

Our Go-To Market Strategy
We sell subscriptions to our cloud-native solution through the demand generated globally by our marketing efforts, using our direct sales force and by leveraging client referrals, industry channel partners and strategic alliances.
Our industry-experienced sales team includes sales development representatives, field sales representatives organized by market segment and region and solution engineers. The team is responsible for managing and developing outbound leads, driving new business and providing product demonstrations. Once a lead is identified, the team frames the unique pain points, goals and needs of the prospective client and works with the solution engineers to map a tailored end-to-end solution molded around their workflows.
Our partnerships are an important aspect of our sales and marketing strategy. We leverage a broad network of global relationships across trading systems, fund administrators, technology providers, investment systems consultants and prime brokers to further expand our reach. Through these relationships, we often receive significant prospect referrals. Our channel partners suggest our solution to their clients because they often benefit operationally from working with clients that have unified data, superior access to information, improved workflows and a stringent control environment. Additionally, our simplified implementation process significantly increases our clients’ speed to market, which is beneficial to our partners whose services are largely dependent on our clients being active in the market.
Our go-to market strategy is supported by a marketing team that oversees all aspects of the Enfusion global demand generation engine including digital marketing, social media, public relations, segment marketing, graphic design, conferences and events. Our marketing efforts focus on generating and facilitating quality inbound leads, optimizing the lead generation strategy, leveraging the power of client references and testimonials, building an institutionalized and recognizable brand and promoting direct sales. We leverage online and offline marketing channels by participating in conferences, industry events and using digital marketing and social media to educate the community on who we are and the solution we provide.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws; a variety of contractual arrangements, such as license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements; and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to protect our rights and the intellectual property used in our business. We do not currently have any patents.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous pending trademark applications in various jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as https://www.enfusion.com/ and other variations.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.
See 1.A. Risk Factors, including the section titled “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property,” for a description of the risks related to our intellectual property.

Our Competition
The market for investment management software and services is highly competitive and we compete with new and established providers that offer products ranging from point solutions to multi-product suites. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:

● | flexibility of solution;
--+-------------------------


● | quality of professional services;
--+----------------------------------


● | depth of product functionality and asset coverage;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | speed of implementations and client support;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | innovation and responsiveness to client needs;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | return on investment and total cost of ownership;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | security and reliability;
--+--------------------------


● | integration and interoperability with third-party systems; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to support regulatory requirements and compliance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors. However, many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets and broader distribution networks. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing and implementing our solution. Furthermore, we expect that our industry will continue to attract new market entrants, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets.
Incumbents such as Blackrock’s Aladdin, Broadridge, State Street Alpha, SS&C, SimCorp, Bloomberg AIM, LayerOne and Coremont may provide end-to-end systems, but many of them are single-tenant and cloud-migrated rather than cloud-native or built for the cloud, or are faced with other deployment challenges. As a result, they are not sufficiently nimble to allow for scale and often require physical provisioning, rely on large teams of specialized personnel that through time are difficult to hire, face latency issues and continue to increase the investment manager’s overall costly and inefficient legacy technology dependencies. Their single tenant and cloud-migrated structures restrict their agility and inhibit their ability to provide frequent or simultaneous upgrades to all of their clients. New entrants in the space often provide single point solutions such as trading, fund administration or portfolio analytics that are intended to be coupled with other offerings. 
We believe our multi-tenant cloud-native solution, comprised of mission critical systems integrated with a suite of services, is highly differentiating. Our cloud-native, single codebase architecture allows us to serve the full investment lifecycle in a way that unifies workflows creating one dataset that accurately reflects the activities across all systems and multiple departments within a client organization in real time. Additionally, our single codebase architecture allows us to deliver faster implementation and continuously add functionality. As a result, we believe Enfusion is able to continue to innovate faster, delivering a better, more nimble solution that investment managers require in light of the global challenges they face.
Human Resources and Culture
As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,006 employees across the Company. Of these employees, 311 are based in the Americas and 695 are based internationally, of which 525 are based in India. We consider our current relationship with 

11



our employees to be strong. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement.
We believe our culture of innovation and “client first” focus fosters creativity and exploration and provides a rewarding career for our employees. Our culture is represented by a set of guiding ideas and values:

● | Grow your career: Our people are the foundation of our company. We invest in the development of our employees’ careers based on their unique talents and interests.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Make an impact: Our people are hands-on with our business and recognized for their results. They influence decisions, interact with clients and contribute ideas.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Challenge yourself: Collaborate as part of our entrepreneurial team. We are self-starters who take on challenges to propel Enfusion’s mission forward.
