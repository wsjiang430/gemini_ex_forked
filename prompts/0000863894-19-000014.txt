 Item 1. Business    ﻿
 General
 ﻿
 Veru Inc., The Prostate Cancer Company, is an oncology and urology biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines for the management of prostate cancer.
 ﻿
 The Company’s prostate cancer pipeline includes VERU-111, zuclomiphene citrate, and VERU-100. VERU-111 is an oral, next-generation, first-in-class small molecule that targets and disrupts alpha and beta tubulin subunits of microtubules in cells to treat metastatic prostate cancer patients whose disease is resistant to both castration and novel androgen-blocking agents (e.g., abiraterone or enzalutamide). VERU-111 is being evaluated in men with metastatic castration and androgen-blocking agent resistant prostate cancer in an open label Phase 1b/2 clinical trial. Zuclomiphene citrate is an oral nonsteroidal estrogen receptor agonist used to treat hot flashes, a common side effect caused by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with advanced prostate cancer. Zuclomiphene citrate is being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial in men with advanced prostate cancer who experience moderate to severe hot flashes. VERU-100 is a novel, proprietary peptide formulation for ADT with multiple potential beneficial clinical attributes addressing the shortfalls of current FDA-approved ADT formulations for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. VERU-100 is a long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist designed to be administered as a small volume subcutaneous 3-month depot injection without a loading dose. VERU-100 will immediately suppress testosterone with no testosterone surge upon initial or repeated administration—a problem which occurs with currently approved luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists used for ADT. Currently, there are no GnRH antagonists commercially approved beyond a one-month injection. VERU-100 is anticipated to enter a Phase 2 dose-finding study in early calendar year 2020.
 ﻿
 The Company is also advancing new drug formulations in its specialty pharmaceutical pipeline addressing unmet medical needs in urology such as the Tadalafil and Finasteride Combination (TADFIN®) for the administration of tadalafil 5mg and finasteride 5mg combination formulation dosed daily to treat urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Tadalafil (CIALIS®) is currently approved for treatment of BPH and erectile dysfunction and finasteride is currently approved for treatment of BPH (finasteride 5mg PROSCAR®) and male pattern hair loss (finasteride 1mg PROPECIA®). The co-administration of tadalafil and finasteride has been shown to be more effective for the treatment of BPH than by finasteride alone. The Company had a successful pre-New Drug Application (NDA) meeting with the FDA and the expected submission of the NDA for TADFIN® is the second half of calendar year 2020. The Company is also developing Tamsulosin XR capsules which is a formulation of tamsulosin, the active ingredient in FLOMAX®, which the Company has designed to avoid the “food effect” inherent in currently marketed versions of the drug, allowing for potentially safer administration and improved patient compliance. 
 ﻿
 The Company's commercial products include the FC2 Female Condom/FC2 Internal Condom® (“FC2”), an FDA-approved product for the dual protection against unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, and the PREBOOST® 4% benzocaine medicated individual wipe for the treatment of premature ejaculation. PREBOOST® is marketed online in the U.S. through an exclusive marketing arrangement under the Roman® Swipes brand name by Roman Health Ventures Inc. Roman is a leading telemedicine company that discreetly sells men's health products via the internet website www.getroman.com. The Company’s Female Health Company Division markets and sells FC2 commercially and in the public health sector both in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., FC2 is available by prescription through the Company’s multiple telemedicine and internet pharmacy partners and retail pharmacies, as well as OTC through the Company’s website at www.fc2.us.com. In the global public health sector, the Company markets FC2 to entities, including ministries of health, government health agencies, U.N. agencies, nonprofit organizations and commercial partners, that work to support and improve the lives, health and well-being of women around the world. 
 ﻿
 In October 2016, we completed our acquisition (the “APP Acquisition”) of Aspen Park Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“APP”). Prior to the completion of the APP Acquisition, the Company had been a single product company, focused on manufacturing, marketing and selling FC2 in the public sector. Most of the Company’s net revenues are currently derived from sales of FC2 in the public and commercial sectors.

Company History    ﻿
 Veru is a Wisconsin corporation that is the successor to The Wisconsin Pharmacal Company, Inc. (“Wisconsin Pharmacal”), a company which manufactured and marketed disparate specialty chemical and branded consumer products. Wisconsin Pharmacal was originally incorporated in 1971. In 1996, we completed a series of actions which resulted in our acquisition of worldwide rights to our first-generation female condom, the divestiture of Wisconsin Pharmacal’s other businesses and the change of our name to “The Female Health Company.” On October 31, 2016, we completed the APP Acquisition, which transitioned us from a single product company selling FC2 to a biopharmaceutical company with multiple drug products under development for urology and oncology. On July 31, 2017, we changed our corporate name from “The Female Health Company” to “Veru Inc.” reflecting our focus on biopharmaceutical products for oncology and urology. 
 ﻿
 Strategy    ﻿
 Our strategy is to be known as “The Prostate Cancer Company”. We aspire to be disease focused by providing a “continuum of care” for prostate cancer patients. Prostate cancer has become a chronic disease with new challenges as prostate cancer develops resistance to current drugs and spreads throughout the body and as the patient suffers from the long-term side effects of these cancer treatments like hot flashes, bone loss and fractures, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of muscle strength and frailty. Accordingly, we are dedicated to the development and commercialization of products to address unmet medical needs for prostate cancer treatment and supportive care. We are developing a pipeline of novel prostate cancer and prostate cancer supportive care medicines as well as urology focused specialty pharmaceuticals while continuing to sell our commercial products to help fund part of this development. We intend to execute this strategy by leveraging the 505(b)(2) FDA regulatory pathway for our urology products in order to create nearer-term revenue to support the development of longer-term novel prostate cancer and prostate cancer supportive care medicines. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
 ﻿

· | Develop and launch high value, novel biopharmaceutical products for prostate cancer and prostate cancer supportive care. We are developing three drugs, VERU-111, zuclomiphene citrate and VERU-100, each of which addresses large potential markets relating to prostate cancer and prostate cancer supportive care. We initiated a Phase 1b/2 open label clinical trial of VERU-111 in treatment-resistant metastatic prostate cancer patients in January 2019. The potential U.S. market for oral cancer therapies in advanced prostate cancer is over $5 billion. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2018 using zuclomiphene citrate for the treatment of hot flashes caused by hormone cancer therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer. The interim topline clinical data results of the Phase 2 clinical trial are expected in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. ADT-induced hot flashes affect approximately 600,000 men in the U.S., representing an estimated annual sales of $600-800 million for zuclomiphene in the U.S. alone. VERU-100 is a novel, proprietary peptide formulation for ADT with multiple beneficial clinical attributes addressing the shortfalls of current FDA-approved ADT formulations for advanced prostate cancer. The global market for ADT was $2.6 billion in 2018.

  ﻿

· | Advance specialty pharmaceutical urology drugs that require only bioequivalence studies by taking advantage of information obtained in previous safety and efficacy studies conducted by other parties. Veru is also advancing new drug formulations in its specialty pharmaceutical pipeline addressing unmet medical needs in urology such as TADFIN® for the administration of tadalafil 5mg and finasteride 5mg combination formulation dosed daily to treat lower urinary tract symptoms caused from BPH. Tadalafil (CIALIS®) is currently approved for treatment of BPH and erectile dysfunction and finasteride is currently approved for treatment BPH (finasteride 5mg PROSCAR®) and male pattern hair loss (finasteride 1mg PROPECIA®). The co-administration of tadalafil and finasteride has been shown to be more effective for the treatment of BPH than by finasteride alone. The Company had a successful pre-NDA meeting with the FDA and the expected submission of the NDA for TADFIN® is the second half of calendar year 2020. Veru is also developing Tamsulosin XR capsules which is a formulation of tamsulosin, the active ingredient in FLOMAX®, which Veru has designed to avoid the “food effect” inherent in currently marketed formulations of the drug, allowing for potentially safer administration and improved patient compliance.

· | Grow our commercial and public sector business. For FC2, we are rapidly growing revenues in the U.S. market through prescription sales by leveraging our relationships with telemedicine and pharmacy internet providers and distributors, while continuing to pursue revenues in the public sector in key markets both in the U.S. and globally. We are also very focused on our strategic relationship with Roman Health Ventures to grow our Roman® Swipes (PREBOOST®) telemedicine business. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Capitalize on expertise and reputation of our management team and board members. Our management team has significant expertise and experience in urology and oncology as well as drug development, marketing and sales which will facilitate effective management of our preclinical studies and clinical trials of drug candidates and product commercialization. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the strong reputations of the members of our management and board of directors with academic institutions, hospitals, physicians, pharmacists and distributors to expand our customer base and to introduce new products.

 VERU-111, an oral, next generation, first-in-class small molecule for the treatment of metastatic prostate and other cancers.
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  In 2019, there were approximately 175,000 new cases of prostate cancer in the U.S. and about 25% will die from the disease. In the U.S., 5% of men with prostate cancer will have metastatic cancer and up to 30% of men with high-risk, localized prostate cancer will develop metastatic cancer following initial therapy. The median survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer ranges from 3.2-4.5 years. For these men, the 1st line therapy is ADT, or medical castration. Although most will initially respond, nearly all these patients will progress to metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and have a poor prognosis with an average survival of 1.5 years. New 2nd line hormonal agents, like XTANDI® (enzalutamide) and ZYTIGA® (abiraterone/prednisone) have resulted in an additional four to five months of average survival, but again, nearly all men on these agents will eventually develop progressive metastatic prostate cancer.
 ﻿
 Agents that target tubulin, the subunits of microtubules, have been shown to be one of the most effective targeted cytotoxic chemotherapies for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Microtubules are critical for cancer cell replication and to shuttle the androgen receptor into the nucleus where the receptor stimulates genes for cancer cell growth. Docetaxel and cabazitaxel are examples of FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs that are given intravenously (IV) that target tubulin to treat metastatic prostate cancer. Although effective, the challenges for this class of chemotherapy agents, also known as taxanes, include that they must be given intravenously (IV) and that the cancer cells develop resistance to taxanes. There are also serious safety concerns with IV taxanes which include serious hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions, myelosuppression (neutropenia) and neurotoxicity such as peripheral neuropathy and muscle weakness.
 ﻿
 VERU-111 is an oral, next generation, first-in-class selective small molecule that targets and binds to the alpha and beta tubulin subunits of microtubules in cells. Microtubules are essential for cell division and for shuttling critical growth receptors into the nucleus where they stimulate cell proliferation. Unlike taxanes which bind to just the beta subunit of tubulin, VERU-111 binds strongly to both the alpha and beta tubulin subunits. Furthermore, VERU-111 inactivates by cleaving poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) which is important for DNA repair in cancer cells. VERU-111 has high oral bioavailability; no expected allergic reactions; less possibility for drug resistance as it does not interact with multiple drug resistance proteins so it cannot be pumped out of the cancer cell; potential for minimal drug to drug interactions; and high activity against many tumor types including prostate cancer resistant to drugs like novel androgen-blocking agents (abiraterone and enzalutamide) and taxanes as well as triple negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and pancreatic cancer. In preclinical and current clinical studies, VERU-111 appears to have no evidence of neurotoxicity and neutropenia, which are common side effects of taxanes and vinca alkaloids chemotherapy agents. 
 ﻿
 Development Plan.  The Company plans to develop VERU-111 initially as a treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer that is castration resistant and who have also failed to respond to ZYTIGA® (abiraterone) or XTANDI® (enzalutamide). In September 2018, the Company completed a pre-Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) meeting with the FDA for VERU-111 in which the FDA agreed with the Company’s plans for a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial and that an IND may be submitted for the indication of men who have metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and who have become resistant to, or who have failed to respond to, ZYTIGA® (abiraterone) or XTANDI® (enzalutamide) and prior to IV chemotherapy. These men have actively progressing prostate cancer with rising prostate-specific antigen and CT or bone scan evidence of spreading prostate cancer. The Company submitted an IND and initiated an open label Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in January 2019 at Johns Hopkins Cancer Center and four other clinical centers. An open label study means that every patient will receive VERU-111. The primary objective of the Phase 1b portion of the study is to define the maximum tolerated dose of VERU-111 (identify the dose limiting toxicity of VERU-111). Through December 12, 2019, the study has enrolled and dosed 33 patients with VERU-111 at doses from 4.5 mg per day up to 81 mg per day with all doses being well tolerated with toxicities that would inhibit increasing the dose further (have not reached dose limiting toxicity). In the study, there have been no observations of neutropenia or neurotoxicity which are common adverse events associated with taxane chemotherapy. The study will continue to enroll patients using increasing doses of VERU-111 until a dose limiting toxicity is observed.

Market.  In the U.S., there is a $6.5 billion annual market for 2nd line oral hormone therapies for prostate cancer and a $1.5 billion annual market for IV-given taxanes chemotherapies (docetaxel $1 billion and cabazitaxel $500 million in prostate cancer) per Decision Resources Group and Allied Market Research. Second line oral hormonal therapies like enzalutamide and abiraterone/prednisone have cross-resistance and appear to provide limited additional benefit when given in sequence for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. VERU-111, as an oral therapy targeting alpha and beta tubulin, could be used prior to IV given docetaxel and cabazitaxel antitubulin chemotherapies. Due to activity of VERU-111 in taxane resistant animal models, VERU-111 could be developed for treatment of patients who have taken IV docetaxel and cabazitaxel chemotherapies and have failed or progressed on these therapies. VERU-111 could also be developed as a 1st line therapy given with androgen deprivation in men who have hormone sensitive, high volume prostate cancer where ADT and docetaxel have been shown in several studies to increase survival in these men by 17-21 months. Another 1st line indication could be developed in men who have metastatic prostate cancer and splice variants of the androgen receptor including a common variant known as AR-V7. Prostate cancer hormone therapies are not effective in men who have AR-V7. However, this type of cancer appears to respond to docetaxel and may be potentially treated by a novel oral therapy targeting alpha and beta tubulin like VERU-111. VERU-111 could also be developed as 1st line metastatic indication in men who initially were treated with ADT and a novel androgen-blocking agent (enzalutamide or apalutamide) for nonmetastatic castration prostate cancer that has now progressed to metastatic prostate cancer. Finally, VERU-111 could also be developed as an oral dosing alternative to chemotherapies for the treatment of metastatic triple negative breast, ovarian, cervical, lung and pancreatic cancers as these tumors also respond to IV taxane chemotherapies.

 Zuclomiphene citrate for the treatment of hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapies in men with advanced prostate cancer.
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer diagnosed in men, with approximately 175,000 new cases in the U.S. in 2019. The estimated prevalence of prostate cancer in the U.S. is 3 million cases for which over one-third will have received ADT. ADT results in very low, castrate levels of testosterone. Eliminating testosterone is an effective therapy as testosterone is a powerful growth factor for prostate cancer. As estrogen is derived from testosterone in men, low levels in testosterone also results in very low levels of estrogen. Low estrogen side effects include hot flashes, bone loss and fractures, loss of libido, memory disturbances, and adverse blood lipid changes. 
 ﻿
 Hot flashes, also known as vasomotor symptoms, are one of the most common and debilitating side effects of prostate cancer hormonal therapies. Hormone therapies include ADT, like LUPRON® and ELIGARD® (leuprolide), FIRMAGON® (degarelix), ZOLADEX® (goserelin), as well as the newer agents approved to treat advanced prostate cancer such as ZYTIGA® (abiraterone) and XTANDI® (enzalutamide). Up to 80% of men on ADT complain of hot flashes with 30-40% having moderate to severe hot flashes. Hot flashes are defined as intense heat sensation, flushing and profuse sweating and chills as well as anxiety and palpitations. Although episodes of hot flashes often occur repeatedly and generally last a few minutes, some may last up to 20 minutes. Hot flashes associated with prostate cancer hormonal therapies tend to persist over time with the same frequency and intensity throughout therapy. Up to 50% of men continue to report hot flashes after five years on prostate cancer hormonal therapy. Patients on ADT report significant effects on daily functioning and quality of life. Hot flashes are one of the main reasons that prostate cancer patients want to delay or stop being treated by ADT. As prostate cancer patients with advanced and metastatic disease are living longer because of more effective ADT, hot flashes have become an even bigger concern and impact on quality of life.

Hormonal and nonhormonal therapies have been used off-label to treat hot flashes in men on prostate cancer hormonal therapies. In general, use of off-label hormonal agents, especially estrogens, have been shown to be helpful for treating hot flashes. However, off label estrogen treatment is complicated by lack of consistent dosing, and known side effects such as gynecomastia (breast enlargement), gynecodynia (painful breasts), and increase in thromboembolic events like deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, and stroke. Progesterone hormone agents, like MEGACE® (megestrol), have also been used off-label but the side effects include weight gain, increase in thromboembolic events like deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, and stroke, and the potential to stimulate the growth of prostate cancer. Nonhormonal agents that also have been used off-label include antiseizure agents and antidepressants that have serious and unwanted side effects. Moreover, nonhormonal agents have demonstrated less effectiveness than hormonal therapies for the treatment of hot flashes. There are no FDA-approved therapies for hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapy in men with advanced prostate cancer. As estrogen deficiency is the reason for the hot flashes, we believe that zuclomiphene, a nonsteroidal estrogen receptor agonist, has the potential to replace estrogen and be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for hot flashes caused by ADT in men with advanced prostate cancer.
 ﻿
 Development Plan. In June 2018, the Company submitted an IND with the FDA for zuclomiphene citrate. In September 2018, the Company enrolled its first subject in the Phase 2 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled dose finding study evaluating two doses of oral daily zuclomiphene (10mg or 50mg) treatment versus placebo in approximately 95 men with advanced prostate cancer who have ADT induced moderate to severe hot flashes. The clinical study has a treatment duration of 12 weeks and is being conducted in 24 clinical centers in the United States. The primary endpoint is the frequency of moderate to severe hot flashes. Secondary endpoints include severity of hot flashes and improvement in bone marker. In October 2019, the Company announced that it has achieved full enrollment for its Phase 2 clinical study. The interim topline clinical data results of the Phase 2 clinical trial are expected in the first quarter of calendar year 2020.
 ﻿
 Market.  Hot flashes are the most common side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapy, with hot flashes occurring in approximately 80% of men receiving one of the common forms of ADT, including LUPRON® (Leuprolide), ELIGARD® (Leuprolide), and FIRMAGON® (degarelix) and about up to 40% of such men experience moderate to severe hot flashes. Approximately 600,000 men annually in the United States are on ADT for advanced prostate cancer. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for hot flashes associated with prostate cancer hormonal therapies. Based on independent market research sponsored by the Company, U.S. peak sales for zuclomiphene citrate to treat hot flashes in men with prostate cancer in ADT are estimated to be approximately $600-800 million.
 ﻿
 VERU-100, a novel, proprietary, long-acting, small volume, subcutaneous peptide 3-month depot formulation androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer.
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  Androgen deprivation therapy remains the primary first line therapy for advanced prostate cancer but the current products, such as LUPRON® and ELIGARD® (leuprolide), FIRMAGON® (degarelix), and ZOLADEX® (goserelin) have several important shortfalls. LUPRON, ELIGARD, and ZOLADEX are LHRH agonists whose initial administration leads to an initial 14 to 21-day testosterone surge (flare) and interval micro increases (spikes or escapes) in testosterone blood levels. FIRMAGON, a GnRH antagonist, is a large-volume subcutaneous formulation designed for only a single month release. FIRMAGON requires a loading dose of two 3 mL subcutaneous injections followed by a 4 mL maintenance subcutaneous injection. The 4 mL maintenance subcutaneous injection has to be repeated monthly. In contrast, VERU-100 is designed to address a number of these important shortfalls of currently marketed ADT products: VERU-100 is a long-acting GnRH antagonist designed to be administered as a small volume (<1 mL) subcutaneous 3-month depot injection without a loading dose. VERU-100, as a GnRH antagonist, immediately suppresses testosterone with no testosterone surge upon initial or repeated administration unlike what occurs with the currently approved LHRH agonists.
 ﻿
 Development Plan.  The Company had a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA in May 2019 clarifying the requirements for regulatory development pathway. FDA agreed to an expedited regulatory development pathway for VERU-100. The Company plans to conduct a single Phase 2 open label, multicenter dose finding clinical study of three doses of VERU-100 in men with advanced prostate cancer (n=60-80) for a single 3 month injection, and a single Phase 3- open label single arm study in men with advanced prostate cancer (n=100) as the pivotal, registration study for NDA submission. The Company plans to submit an IND in early calendar year 2020 and then initiate the Phase 2 dose finding study.

Market.  VERU-100 is a long-acting GnRH antagonist for ADT designed to be administered as a small volume subcutaneous 3-month depot injection without a loading dose. As a GnRH antagonist, VERU-100 should immediately suppress testosterone with no testosterone surge upon initial or repeated administration and no testosterone micro-increases which may adversely affect patient outcomes—a problem which potentially occurs with approved LHRH agonist drugs like LUPRON®, ZOLADEX® and ELIGARD®. Currently, there are no GnRH antagonists commercially approved beyond a 1 month depot injection, making VERU-100, if approved, the only commercially available GnRH antagonist 3-month depot. Total global sales of ADT drugs in 2018 were $2.6 billion.

 TADFIN® (tadalafil 5mg and finasteride 5mg combination) capsules for the initial treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms and enlarged prostate 
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview. Tadalafil/Finasteride combination product in capsules is a new, proprietary formulation that addresses men who have lower urinary tract symptoms and restricted urinary stream because of an enlarged prostate. CIALIS® (tadalafil 5mg) and PROSCAR® (finasteride 5mg) co-administration is indicated for the initial treatment of BPH for up to 26 weeks. CIALIS® (tadalafil 5mg) is a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor and PROSCAR® (finasteride 5mg) is a Type 2, 5 alpha reductase inhibitor. Tadalafil 5mg daily has been approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and BPH. Finasteride 5mg has been approved for the treatment of BPH: to improve symptoms, to reduce risk of acute urinary retention and the need for prostate surgery, and to prevent progression of BPH. 
 ﻿
 Development Plan. In a November 2017 Pre-IND meeting, the FDA confirmed that the Tadalafil/Finasteride combination qualifies for a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The FDA also agreed that a single bioequivalence study and no additional nonclinical, clinical efficacy and/or safety studies will be required to support the approval of the Tadalafil/Finasteride combination for the initial treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with enlarged prostates. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the proposed NDA and to confirm the clinical, non-clinical, and chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) requirements for the Company's NDA submission utilizing the FDA expedited 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The Company submitted a pre-NDA briefing document to the FDA that outlined the Company's preliminary data package being prepared for the NDA submission, including bioequivalence and bioavailability clinical study results, CMC and other regulatory elements for a 505(b)(2) submission. In June 2018, the Company announced that it concluded its pre-NDA meeting with the FDA for TADFIN® (tadalafil 5mg and finasteride 5mg combination) formulation for the treatment of BPH. The Company believes it has reached agreement with the FDA on the regulatory data package requirements that will be sufficient for submission. The FDA requested that the Company submit 12-month stability data on manufacturing batches to support the expiry date of TADFIN® at the time of the NDA submission. The Company plans to submit an NDA for TADFIN® in the second half of calendar year 2020.
 ﻿
 Market. The worldwide prevalence of BPH lower urinary symptoms is estimated to be 10-25% of the male population and was estimated to grow to 1.1 billion men by 2018. According to Elkelany O et al. (Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management 11:507-513, 2015), other men who may benefit from this combination include: 1) men who have a suboptimal response to 5 alpha reductase inhibitors alone (PROSCAR® (finasteride) or AVODART® (dutasteride)); 2) men who have a suboptimal response to an alpha blocker alone (FLOMAX® (tamsulosin), HYTRIN® (terazosin), UROXATRAL® (alfuzosin), CARDURA® (doxazosin), and RAPAFLO® (silodosin)) or in combination with a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor (JALYN® (dutasteride/tamsulosin combination)); and 3) men who have an optimal response to 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, but who also have erectile dysfunction. A Tadalafil 5mg / Finasteride 5mg combination is not currently available. TADFIN®, if approved, would be the first fixed combination of tadalafil and finasteride approved by FDA. TADFIN® would provide clinical benefit both by increasing dosing convenience and drug compliance as poor compliance with a BPH medicine could lead to an increased chance of acute urinary retention, urosepsis, and death. The Company plans to sell TADFIN® through men’s health telemedicine internet channels in the U.S. and to out-license TADFIN® to urology specialty pharmaceutical marketing and sales organizations for upfront payment, milestones, and royalties in territories outside the U.S.

Tamsulosin XR capsules for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms of BPH.
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  Tamsulosin XR (Extended Release) capsules are new slow release formulations containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient in FLOMAX® (tamsulosin HCL) capsules which is a commonly used medicine for the treatment of symptoms of BPH, also known as enlargement of the prostate. FLOMAX® is indicated for the treatment of symptoms of BPH. Tamsulosin is a selective alpha1 adrenergic receptor blocking drug that is specific for the alpha1 adrenergic receptors located in the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck. Symptoms associated with BPH occur, at least in part, as a result of increased smooth muscle tone of the prostate and bladder which leads to constriction of urinary flow, urinary retention, urinary infection, kidney damage and life-threatening blood infection called urosepsis. Blocking these alpha1 adrenergic receptors relaxes the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck resulting in the improvement of urinary flow rate and alleviation of the symptoms of BPH. FLOMAX® capsules can only be taken after a meal. It has a “food effect” such that, if FLOMAX® is not taken with food, the drug gets in too fast and men are placed at higher risk for dizziness and postural hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing that can lead to fainting). The Company is developing its Tamsulosin XR capsules to avoid this food effect, allowing for potentially safer administration and improved patient compliance. In addition, Tamsulosin XR capsules have granule formulations, as opposed to being a pill or a tablet, which may make it easier for the population of men who have difficulty swallowing pills and tablets (dysphagia) to take their medicine either by swallowing a capsule or by opening the capsule to ingest the granules within the capsule, increasing patient compliance. Pills and tablets are problematic for 15% of men over the age of 60 in the general community and the up to 60% of men in long term facilities who have difficulty or cannot swallow pills and tablets because of certain medical conditions, including degenerative neurological diseases like Parkinson's, having suffered a stroke, and Alzheimer’s disease. Not being able to take an alpha blocker drug for BPH, like FLOMAX®, because of difficulty or not able to swallow pills and tablets may lead to the increased risk of acute urinary retention, urinary catheterization, urosepsis and death. These men are currently managed with diapers, urinary catheters, or prostate surgery. 
 ﻿
 Development Plan.  Tamsulosin XR capsules contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, tamsulosin, that is found in FLOMAX® (tamsulosin HCL 0.4mg) capsules and, as such, would be expected to have the same efficacy and safety as FLOMAX®. On August 12, 2016, the FDA agreed that the Company's Tamsulosin XR capsules qualify for the expedited 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway. In March 2017, the Company initiated a Stage 1 (pilot) bioequivalence clinical study and in April 2017, announced the successful completion of Stage 1 of the bioequivalence clinical study, which demonstrated that the blood levels of the drug over time were bioequivalent to FLOMAX®. In August 2017, the Company initiated Stage 2 of the bioequivalence clinical study of Tamsulosin granules and in November 2017 announced the results of Stage 2 of the bioequivalence clinical study. During the Stage 2 bioequivalence clinical study, dosing patients with Tamsulosin granules while fasted and Tamsulosin granules while fed successfully showed bioequivalence with FLOMAX® fed patients based on AUC, which is the key determinant of drug exposure over time. The Tamsulosin granule formulation did not meet the remaining bioequivalence criterion for peak value (Cmax). The Company has developed new formulations to address Cmax. Importantly, the tamsulosin granule XR formulation, based on the bioequivalence studies, does not have a food effect which means that the new formulation may be administered without food. As a consequence, the Company is developing Tamsulosin XR (extended release) capsules, which contain the new formulated granules, for the urology and primary care markets. The Company plans to evaluate current resources and priorities to determine the timing of the initiation of the bioequivalence clinical study.    ﻿
 Market.  The initial commercialization plan for Tamsulosin XR capsules is to target urology and primary care physicians with an oral branded product with no food effect for men. Tamsulosin oral suspension is not currently available, and if approved, Tamsulosin XR capsules would be the only oral suspension formulation that would be available on formularies in long term care pharmacies. The U.S. market for all alpha blockers for BPH because the entry of generics has caused price erosion is now estimated to be $386 million annually per IQVIA. Men in long term care or nursing homes have up to a 60% prevalence of swallowing difficulties and account for about 13% of total tamsulosin sales, whereas over 15% of men over 60 years of age in the general population have difficulty swallowing pills and tablets.

 FC2 for dual protection against unintended pregnancy and transmission of STIs.
 ﻿
 Product.  FC2 is the only currently available female-controlled product approved for marketing by the FDA and cleared by the World Health Organization (WHO) for purchase by U.N. agencies that provides dual protection against unintended pregnancy and the transmission of STIs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has referenced the use of condoms, including the female condom, as a means to reduce the risk of transmitting STIs, including HIV/AIDS, and the transmission of Zika by sex. FC2 was approved for market by the FDA in 2009.
 ﻿
 FC2 has basically the same physical design, specifications, safety, and efficacy profile as FC1, the Company's first-generation female condom. Manufactured from a nitrile polymer formulation that is exclusive to the Company, FC2 is produced more economically than FC1, which was made from a more costly raw material, polyurethane. FC2 consists of a soft, loose fitting sheath and two rings: an external ring of rolled nitrile and a loose internal ring made of flexible polyurethane. FC2’s soft sheath lines the vagina, preventing skin-to-skin contact during intercourse. Its external ring remains outside the vagina, partially covering the external genitalia. The internal ring is used for insertion and helps keep the device in place during use.
 ﻿
 FC2’s primary raw material, a nitrile polymer, offers a number of benefits over natural rubber latex, the raw material most commonly used in male condoms. FC2’s nitrile polymer is stronger than latex, reducing the probability that the female condom sheath will tear during use. Unlike latex, FC2’s nitrile polymer quickly transfers heat. FC2 can warm to body temperature immediately upon insertion, which may enhance the user’s sensation and pleasure. Unlike the male condom, FC2 may be inserted before sex, eliminating disruption during sexual intimacy. FC2 is also an alternative to latex sensitive users who are unable to use male condoms without irritation. For example, 7% to 20% of the individuals with significant exposure to latex rubber (i.e., health care workers) experience such irritation. To the Company's knowledge, there is no reported allergy to the nitrile polymer. FC2 is pre-lubricated, disposable, and approved for single-use to prevent pregnancy and the transfer of STIs.
 ﻿
 U.S. Market.  The market for FC2 in the U.S., as the only FDA approved for market female use product that protects against the transmission of STIs and unwanted pregnancies, is rapidly growing. FC2 is currently reimbursable by prescription under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) and the laws of 20+ states prior to enactment of the ACA. The ACA was signed into law in March 2010 and was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among these many rules, the ACA requires non-grandfathered health plans and health insurance issuers to provide 100% coverage of preventive care services. ACA guidance defines preventive services to include contraception methods. The ACA guidance further requires health plans to cover at 100% payment of at least one form of contraception within each method identified by the FDA in its current Birth Control Guide. As a result, with FC2 currently reimbursable by prescription under the ACA, as well as the laws of 20+ states prior to enactment of the ACA, prescription sales of FC2 in the U.S. have grown rapidly and growth of prescription sales in the U.S. is a key part of our strategy for FC2. As FC2 is nonhormonal, it is a viable alternative for many U.S. women who have reported dissatisfaction with the side effects of hormonal birth control. Moreover, there are unique groups of women such as breast cancer survivors who desire contraception and cannot take hormonal birth control because of this underlying condition. We have built the necessary infrastructure to allow for broad access across the U.S. As a result, FC2 is now available through multiple access channels including: 92% of major retail pharmacies, community-based organizations, by prescription, telemedicine, universities, direct purchase and 340B qualified health care clinics, and directly to the public sector without distributors. In particular, we have partnered with fast-growing, highly reputable telemedicine firms (telemedicine being the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunications technology) to bring our much-needed FC2 product to patients in a cost-effective and highly convenient manner. Marketing and educational programs, both traditional and by digital and social media, are being developed for the U.S. public sector and implemented to target health care providers, community-based organizations, and women to coordinate awareness and access to FC2 that is fully reimbursable and to educate on the use of FC2. 
 ﻿
 Global Public Health Sector Market.  FC2’s primary use is for disease prevention and family planning, and the global public health sector has been the main market for FC2. Within the global public health sector, various organizations supply critical products such as FC2, at no cost or low cost, to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products for themselves.

﻿
 The Company currently has a limited number of customers in the global public health sector, who generally purchase in large quantities. Over the past few years, significant customers have included large global agencies, such as the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Brazil Ministry of Health either through UNFPA or Semina Indústria e Comércio Ltda (Semina), the Company’s distributor in Brazil, and the Republic of South Africa health authorities that purchase through the Company’s various local distributors. DKT, a new distributor for FC2, is one of the world’s largest providers of family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention products and services with offices in 24 countries. DKT has started registration processes to distribute FC2 in several countries this year to expand market access. These DKT countries include Afghanistan, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Other customers in the global public health sector include ministries of health or other governmental agencies, which either purchase directly or via in-country distributors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
 ﻿
 FC2 has been distributed in the U.S. and 149 other countries. A significant number of countries with the highest demand potential are in the developing world. The incidence of HIV/AIDS, other STIs, and unwanted pregnancy in these countries represents a remarkable potential for significant sales of a product that benefits some of the world’s most underprivileged people. However, conditions in these countries can be volatile and result in unpredictable delays in program development, tender applications, and processing orders.
 ﻿
 The global public health sector market for male condoms is estimated to be greater than 8-10 billion units annually. The private sector market for male condoms is estimated at 10-15 billion units annually. The combined global male condom market (public and private sector) is estimated at a value of $4.5 billion annually. The female condom market represents a very small portion of the total global condom market, yet 50% of individuals living with HIV/AIDS are women. As a result, a number of independent women’s groups are advocating for increased investment in and distribution of female condoms on a gender equality basis.
 ﻿
 The Company has distribution agreements and other arrangements with commercial partners which market FC2 as a consumer health product through distributors and retailers in 16 countries, including Brazil, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom. These agreements are generally exclusive for a single country. Under these agreements, the Company sells FC2 to the distributor partners, who market and distribute the product to consumers in the established territory. 
 ﻿
 On August 27, 2018, the Company announced that through six of its distributors in the Republic of South Africa, the Company had received a tender award to supply 75% of a tender covering up to 120 million female condoms over three years.
 ﻿
 PREBOOST®/Roman® Swipes (4% benzocaine medicated individual wipes) for the treatment of premature ejaculation.    ﻿
 Product.  Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common sexual dysfunction condition for men even more prevalent than erectile dysfunction based on epidemiological studies. PE is a self-reported diagnosis. Men with PE desire treatment; however, most are reluctant and unlikely to request treatment out of embarrassment. Discrepancies also exist between the man and his partner's reports of the man's ejaculatory behavior as women have been found to report PE affecting their relationship more often than their male partner. 
     PREBOOST® is a proprietary OTC male genital desensitizer used for the treatment of PE. There are no prescription products for PE approved by the FDA. Off-label use of antidepressants and PDE-5 inhibitors has had limited success because of inconsistent efficacy and unacceptable side effects. Psychological counseling and behavioral therapy are also used with mixed results. Of the consumer health products, the topical anesthetics are administered as sprays and gels. The drawbacks of these treatment approaches include inconsistent dosing leading to too much anesthetic and transference of the anesthetics to the partner. PREBOOST® is compliant with the FDA monograph and is approved for sale in the U.S. PREBOOST® is the only individually packaged medicated wipe that contains a desensitizing agent (benzocaine 4.0%). The advantages are: 1) Convenient individually wrapped wipes so it is easier to carry and to be discreet, 2) The correct dose is delivered each time, 3) The medicine is applied topically and dries quickly which prevents the potential for transference to partner, 4) Benzocaine at 4.0% temporarily desensitizes, but does not completely numb the penis, and 5) PREBOOST® efficacy is supported by a published randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.

﻿
 Market.  PREBOOST® is approved for sale in the U.S. The Company has entered into a multi-year U.S. distribution agreement with Roman Health Ventures which markets the product as Roman® Swipes. Roman is a leading U.S. telemedicine company.    ﻿
 Government Regulation    ﻿
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, advertising, and promotion of our products.
 ﻿
 FDA Regulation of Female Condoms.  FC2 was approved for market by the FDA, via a Premarket Approval Application (PMA), as a Class III medical device in 2009. On September 21, 2018, the FDA issued a final order reclassifying female condoms from Class III to Class II medical devices, renaming them “single-use internal condoms” and requiring new devices in this category to submit a 510(k) premarket notification and comply with various “special controls.” Special controls are a battery of product clinical testing which includes, but is not limited to, determining product effectiveness against pregnancy and against infection transmission, and product tolerability. Companies seeking clearance of new single-use internal condoms may now do so by demonstrating to the FDA in a 510(k) submission that a proposed condom is substantially equivalent to FC2 with respect to intended use and technology.
 ﻿
 All marketed devices cleared or approved by the FDA are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. As a result, we are required to register our manufacturing establishments with the FDA and list FC2 with the FDA as a commercially distributed device. We must comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR), which requires that devices be manufactured and records be maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, and control activities. We must comply with the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation requires that we provide information to the FDA whenever evidence reasonably suggests that one of our FC2 devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or where a malfunction has occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Further, we are required to comply with FDA requirements for labeling, promotion and advertising. Any future modifications to the design, technology or labeling of FC2 that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, require a new 510(k) clearance. Non‑compliance with any of these requirements can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, total or partial suspension of production, and criminal prosecution.
 ﻿
 Because FC2 is a commercially distributed medical device, the facilities in which FC2 is manufactured and tested are subject to periodic FDA inspection to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, including the QSR and MDR regulations. The Company’s most recent FDA inspection of its U.K. and Malaysian facilities was completed in September 2010 and November 2019, respectively. The Company’s previous office in Chicago was inspected by the FDA in October 2016 for activities related to being an initial importer of FC2 and the FDA made observations at this inspection that the FDA expects us to have addressed by the next regularly scheduled inspection.    ﻿

FDA Regulation of OTC Monograph Drug Products.  Generally, any new drug must undergo FDA review for safety and efficacy to obtain marketing approval before it may be legally marketed in the U.S. However, if the drug is generally recognized as safe and effective, or GRASE, then it is exempt from regulation as a new drug and may be marketed without prior approval. In 1972, the FDA initiated the comprehensive review of safety, effectiveness, and labeling (i.e., a review of the GRASE status) of OTC drugs then on the market, known as FDA’s OTC Drug Monograph Review, which establishes parameters under which OTC drugs may be marketed as GRASE without the need for pre-market approval of a New Drug Application. The FDA’s OTC Drug Monograph Review is a rulemaking process that establishes conditions under which certain active ingredients, in certain amounts, and with specific labeling, may be marketed as OTC drugs without requiring FDA approval. Monographs do not specify which inactive ingredients may or may not be used. Instead, the FDA has issued a regulation requiring inactive ingredients to be “safe” and “suitable” and to not interfere with the drug’s efficacy. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer, marketer, and distributor to ensure that the finished product, including all inactive ingredients, is safe and effective for its intended use. If the FDA determines that an OTC drug does not conform to the conditions in the applicable FDA regulation and monograph, the product may be considered adulterated or misbranded and subject to FDA enforcement actions.
 ﻿
 FDA Regulation of Pharmaceutical Products.  The process required by the FDA before pharmaceutical product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 ﻿

· | nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, including some that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | FDA approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a drug candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30‑day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board (IRB) for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board (DSMB), which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
 ﻿


 
16

 

In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
 ﻿

· | Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted to test the drug candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion in healthy volunteers or patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Phase 2—Studies are conducted with groups of patients with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule, and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Phase 3—These clinical trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations. At least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials are generally required for approval of a new drug.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so‑called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a drug candidate and can provide important safety information. 
 ﻿
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 ﻿
 505(b)(2) Approval Process. Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides an expedited regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA's findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the Reference Listed Drug (RLD). The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support any change from the RLD. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 ﻿
 We expect our zuclomiphene citrate, TADFIN® and Tamsulosin XR drug candidates to qualify for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway because they are or will be based on already approved active pharmaceutical ingredients rather than new chemical entities, and formulations that have been through Phase 1 studies. On August 12, 2016, the FDA cleared Tamsulosin granules for the expedited 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway and agreed with our plans to conduct a single bioequivalence study to support the filing of an NDA. On May 24, 2017, the FDA agreed with the Company’s plans to enter the Phase 2 dose finding clinical trial to evaluate zuclomiphene citrate for the treatment of hot flashes in men on ADT. In November 2017, the FDA also agreed in Pre-IND meetings that the Tadalafil/Finasteride combination qualifies for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.

Orange Book Listing.  In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the competitor has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the RLD and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii statement” certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than certify to a listed method‑of‑use patent. 
 ﻿
 NDA Submission and Review by the FDA.  The results of product development, nonclinical studies, and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, within 60 days after submission of the NDA, the FDA’s goal for a non‑priority review of a 505(b)(2) NDA is ten months to complete the review process for the application and respond to the applicant, which can take the form of either a Complete Response Letter or Approval. The review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information, studies, or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, and/or require post‑marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. FDA approval of any NDA submitted by us will be at a time the FDA chooses. Also, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post‑marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post‑marketing studies. 
 ﻿
 Post‑Approval Requirements for Pharmaceutical Products.  Any pharmaceutical products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences. Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third‑party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the NDA.
 ﻿
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity, and potency that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off‑label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off‑label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off‑label use.

﻿
 The Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 
 ﻿
 Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Regulation of Advertising. The FTC regulates OTC drug and non-restricted medical device advertising and promotional materials under the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices as well as the dissemination of any false advertisement that is likely to induce the purchase of drugs and non-restricted medical devices. The FTC requires that all express and implied claims must be substantiated. The FTC has historically applied a standard of competent and reliable scientific evidence for health-related claims. This standard is defined generally to require tests, analyses, research or studies that have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by qualified persons and are generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results. In some instances, the FTC has interpreted this standard as requiring randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. The FTC is authorized to issue cease-and-desist orders enforceable by injunctions, civil penalties, and criminal contempt proceedings for violating the FTC Act, as well as to proceed directly in federal court for injunctive relief and to obtain ancillary consumer redress.
 ﻿
 Other Healthcare Regulations.  Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education, and other activities will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including but not limited to, the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, the Veterans Health Care Act, and similar state laws. 
 ﻿
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti‑Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 
 ﻿
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. 
 ﻿
 We and our business activities are subject to the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA and its implementing regulations require certain manufacturers of drugs and medical devices for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 ﻿
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Outside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. Legal requirements in the countries in which we do business relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the E.U., the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and imposes increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules.    ﻿
 The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 requires manufacturers of “covered drugs” to offer those drugs for sale to certain federal agencies, including but not limited to, the Department of Veterans Affairs, on the Federal Supply Schedule, which requires compliance with applicable federal procurement laws. 
 ﻿
 Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties, including criminal, civil, and/or administrative criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits, and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business. 
 ﻿
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 ﻿
 Anti-Corruption Laws.  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Other countries where the Company conducts business have similar anti-corruption laws, including the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act.

Foreign and Other Regulation.  In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 ﻿
 FC2 received the CE Mark which allows it to be marketed throughout the European Union. FC2 has also been approved by regulatory authorities in Brazil, Canada, and other jurisdictions.
 ﻿
 The Company’s facility may also be subject to inspection by UNFPA, USAID, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and country specific ministries of health. 
 ﻿
 Intellectual Property
 ﻿
 We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business.
 ﻿
 VERU-111 and Related Compounds License. We hold an exclusive worldwide license to nine issued U.S. patents, nine pending U.S. patent applications and 71 patents and patent applications in countries outside the United States, including issued patents in the European Union and Japan, relating to our VERU-111 drug candidate and related compounds. This license contains provisions requiring upfront, milestone and royalty payments to the licensor (Ohio State Innovation Fund). If we fail to comply with these obligations or other obligations to the licensor, the licensor might have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to commercialize these drug candidates. The patents relating to VERU-111 and related compounds have statutory expiration dates from 2029 to 2034. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates with a maximum five-year patent term extension expected because of clinical development and FDA review time.
 ﻿
 Zuclomiphene Citrate Patent and Patent Applications. We have two issued U.S. patents and ten patent applications in countries outside the United States related to substantially pure zuclomiphene for the treatment of hot flashes, osteoporosis, bone fractures, and loss of bone mineral density, especially in men on prostate cancer hormone therapies. The U.S. patent and any patents issuing from the foreign patent applications would expire in July 2035.
 ﻿
 VERU-100 Patent Applications. We have two U.S. patent applications and eleven patent applications in countries outside the United States relating to the long-term release of a GnRH antagonist hormone for ADT for men with advanced prostate cancer. The U.S. patent and any patents issuing from the foreign patent applications would expire in January 2038.
 ﻿
 Tamsulosin XR capsules Patent Applications. We own thirteen patent applications with respect to Tamsulosin XR capsules, all of which have expiration dates in 2037: (1) a U.S. patent application; and (2) patent applications in twelve countries outside the U.S. The Company acquired those patent rights pursuant to a purchase agreement that provides for significant continuing installment and milestone payment obligations. In addition, the Company granted a security interest in the purchased assets to the seller to secure the Company's present and future payment and performance obligations under the purchase agreement. Accordingly, there could be significant payments that the Company will be required to make in the future to the seller of the Tamsulosin XR capsule and the failure to make such payments may result in the Company losing its rights to such intellectual property. If the Company fails to retain such rights, we would not be able to commercialize any products relating to Tamsulosin XR capsules.
 ﻿
 FC2 Patents.  FC2 patents have been issued by the United States, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and India. The patents cover the key aspects of FC2, including its overall design and manufacturing process. The patents have expiration dates in 2023 and 2024.
 ﻿
 PREBOOST® Patent Application.  PREBOOST®, medicated individual wipes which is a male genital desensitizing drug product that helps in the treatment of PE, is covered by a pending U.S. patent application.

Trademarks. The Company has a registration for the trademarks “FC2 Female Condom” and “PREBOOST®” in the U.S. and has filed applications in the U.S. for the trademarks “Veru Inc.,” “Veru Healthcare,” “Veru Biopharma,” “Veru Pharmaceuticals” and “Veru Pharma.” The Company has filed applications or secured registrations in 40 countries or jurisdictions around the world to protect the various names and symbols used in marketing its Female Condoms. 
 ﻿
 We cannot be certain that any of our pending patent applications, or those of our licensors, will result in issued patents. In addition, because the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, the patents we own and license, or any further patents we may own or license, may not prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents. In recent years, several companies have been extremely aggressive in challenging patents covering pharmaceutical products, and the challenges have often been successful. We cannot be assured that our patents will not be challenged by third parties or that we will be successful in any defense we undertake. Failure to successfully defend a patent challenge could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 ﻿
 In addition, changes in patent laws, rules or regulations or in their interpretations or enforcement in the U.S. and other countries by the courts may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 ﻿
 The term of an individual patent depends upon the legal term for patents in the country in which such patent is obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each medicine and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.
 ﻿
 As with other biopharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property positions for our product candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, certain patent applications that we have filed or may file, or that we have licensed or may license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of corresponding patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim intellectual property to which we have rights, we may have to participate in proceedings in the USPTO to determine invention rights, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that any related patent may remain in force for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.
 ﻿
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with any future collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants and by using invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of intellectual property that is developed through a relationship with a third party.

Significant Customers
 ﻿
 Because FC2 provides dual protection against both the transmission of STIs, including HIV/AIDS, and unintended pregnancy, it is an integral part of both HIV/AIDS prevention and family planning programs throughout the world. These programs are typically supplied by global public health sector buyers who purchase products for distribution, at low cost or no cost, to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products themselves. Within the global public health sector are large global agencies, such as UNFPA, USAID, DFID (the U.K.’s Department for International Development), and PSI (Population Services International), other social marketing groups, various government health agencies, and NGOs. Within the global public health sector, the Company’s most significant customers are either global public health sector agencies, country specific ministries of health, or those who facilitate their purchases and/or distribution. In the U.S. market, the Company has experienced fast growth in prescription sales of FC2 in fiscal 2019 largely through the Company’s supply agreement with a leading telemedicine provider, which has become one of our largest customers and accounted for 36% of the Company’s net revenues in fiscal 2019. The Company's three largest customers in fiscal 2019 accounted for 64% of the Company’s net revenues. 
 ﻿

Employees 
 ﻿
 As of November 30, 2019, the Company had 386 full-time employees, including 24 located in the U.S., 11 in the U.K., 349 in Malaysia, and two in other countries to implement training and programs. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union. The Company believes that its employee relations are good. 
 ﻿
 Environmental Regulation  
 ﻿
 The Company believes there are no material issues or material costs associated with the Company's compliance with environmental laws. The Company did not incur environmental expenses in fiscal 2019 or 2018, nor does it anticipate environmental expenses in the foreseeable future.
 ﻿
 Raw Materials    ﻿
 The principal raw material used to produce FC2 is a nitrile polymer. While general nitrile formulations are available from a number of suppliers, the Company has chosen to work closely with the technical market leader in synthetic polymers to develop a grade ideally suited to the bio-compatibility and functional needs of a female condom. As a result, the Company relies on supply for its principal raw material for FC2 from one supplier that could produce the raw material from multiple supply points within its organization. The principal partially-finished component used to produce FC2 is a dipped nitrile polymer sheath. The Company procures its component sheaths from one of the leading manufacturers of nitrile surgical gloves. These sheaths are sourced from multiple manufacturing sites controlled by this vendor.
 ﻿
 Manufacturing    ﻿
 The Company manufactures and warehouses FC2 within a leased facility with approximately 45,800 square feet of space in Selangor D.E., Malaysia. Production capacity at this facility is approximately 100 million units of FC2 annually. This facility is subject to periodic inspection by the FDA to ensure compliance with cGMP, as well as the U.K.-based notified body, which is responsible for CE and ISO accreditation.
 ﻿
 The Company has entered into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers to produce PREBOOST®.
 ﻿
 The Company expects to rely on third-party contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce, package and store sufficient quantities of any future drug candidates.
 ﻿
 Competition    ﻿
 FC2 participates in the same market as male condoms; however, it is not seen as directly competing with male condoms. Rather, studies show that providing FC2 is additive in terms of prevention and choice. Male condoms cost less and have brand names that are more widely recognized than FC2. In addition, male condoms are generally manufactured and marketed by companies with significantly greater financial resources than the Company.

Other parties have developed and marketed female condoms. None of these female condoms marketed or under development by other parties have secured FDA market approval. FDA market approval is required to sell female condoms in the U.S. USAID, a U.S. government funded agency, prefers to procure from the FDA product approval for market; however there can be exceptions. Outside of the U.S., the Company has experienced increasing competition and pricing pressures for FC2. In addition to FC2, three female condoms have successfully completed the WHO prequalification process and been cleared by UNFPA for purchase by U.N. agencies: the Cupid female condom (which was prequalified by WHO in July 2012 and cleared by UNFPA thereafter), the Velvet female condom marketed by Hindustan Latex Limited (which was prequalified by WHO and cleared by UNFPA in March 2016) and the female condom marketed by PATH (which was prequalified by WHO and cleared by UNFPA in March 2016). The PATH female condom lost its prequalification in 2019, which leaves only two other competitive female condoms with WHO prequalification in addition to FC2. It is possible that other female condoms may complete the WHO prequalification process. The female condom marketed by Hindustan Latex Limited, which is the Company’s former exclusive distributor in India, is substantially similar in design to FC2, except it is made of latex. FC2 has also been competing with other female condoms in markets that do not require either FDA market approval or WHO prequalification. Reflecting increased competition, Cupid received part of the last two South African tenders. Increasing competition in FC2’s markets has, and will likely continue to, put pressure on pricing for FC2 and may also adversely affect sales of FC2. Some customers, particularly in the global public health sector, prioritize price over other features where FC2 may have an advantage. The FDA’s reclassification of female condoms in 2018 from Class III medical devices to Class II medical devices may reduce the barriers for other types of female condoms to enter the U.S. market. If other female condoms enter the U.S. market, we may face increased competition in the U.S., which may put downward pressure on pricing for FC2 and adversely affect sales of FC2 in the U.S. 
 ﻿
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. The success of our pharmaceutical products will depend on our ability to acquire, develop and commercialize products and our ability to establish and maintain markets for any products for which we receive marketing approval. Potential competitors in North America, Europe and elsewhere include major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions and government agencies. Many of the competitors with respect to our pharmaceutical products under development have substantially greater research and development and regulatory capabilities and experience, and substantially greater management, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and financial resources, than we have or will have.
 ﻿
 All drugs currently used to treat BPH symptoms are sold in tablets or capsules. These drugs include those that decrease size of the prostate, like 5 alpha reductase inhibitors which include PROSCAR® (finasteride) from Merck & Co., Inc. and AVODART® (dutasteride) from GlaxoSmithKline. The other major class of drugs treat BPH by relaxing the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck and include alpha blockers like FLOMAX® (tamsulosin HCI) from Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, HYTRIN® (terazosin), UROXATRAL® (alfuzosin), CARDURA® (doxazosin), and RAPAFLO® (silodosin) from Allergan as well as Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors like CIALIS ® (tadalafil) from Eli Lilly. One class of drugs combines a drug that shrinks and another that relaxes the prostate called JALYN® (dutasteride/tamsulosin combination) from GlaxoSmithKline. Boehringer Ingelheim has a tablet (non-powder) version of FLOMAX® called FLOMAX® CR now available in Canada that can be taken with or without food. Similarly, there is a tablet Tamsulosin product available in the U.K. called Cositam XL 400 microgram that can be taken independently of food.
 ﻿
 Although there are no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of hot flashes in men who have advanced prostate cancer as a side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapies, there are several drugs being used off-label including steroidal estrogens and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants including EFFEXOR® (venlafaxine) and anticonvulsants like NEURONTIN® (gabapentin) which could be competitive with our zuclomiphene citrate drug candidate for the treatment of hot flashes in men who have advanced prostate cancer as a side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapies.

VERU-111 is a first-in-class oral therapy that targets both alpha and beta tubulin and will be initially developed for prostate, breast and ovarian cancers. All currently available tubulin targeting agents are chemotherapies that are given IV and include Vinca Alkaloids such as VELBAN® (vinblastine), ONCOVIN® (vincristine) and NAVELBINE® (vinorelbine). These chemotherapies are primarily used for hematologic malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, sarcoma), and some neuroblastoma, thyroid cancer and non-small cell cancer of the lung. Taxanes such as TAXOL® (paclitaxel), TAXOTERE® (docetaxel) and JEVTANA® (cabazitaxel) are primarily used for solid tumors such as breast, ovarian, endometrial, cervical, lung, head and neck, esophageal, bladder, gastric and prostate. TAXOTERE® (docetaxel) and JEVTANA® (cabazitaxel) are indicated for advanced metastatic prostate cancer, are given IV and bind to the taxane site of tubulin.    ﻿
 VERU-100 is a long-acting GnRH antagonist for ADT designed to be administered as a small volume subcutaneous 3-month depot injection without a loading dose. As a GnRH antagonist, it should immediately suppress testosterone with no testosterone surge upon initial or repeated administration and no testosterone micro-increases which may adversely affect patient outcomes—a problem which potentially occurs with approved LHRH agonist drugs like LUPRON®, ZOLADEX® and ELIGARD®. Currently, there are no GnRH antagonists commercially approved beyond 1 month, making VERU-100, if approved, the only commercially available GnRH antagonist 3-month depot.
 ﻿
 The main therapeutic products that are competitive with PREBOOST® include lidocaine and other anesthetic creams, gels and sprays. Off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants like PAXIL® (paroxetine) have also been used off-label to prevent PE.
