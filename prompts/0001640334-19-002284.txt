Business Operations

Development of Our Business

Incorporation and Early Corporate History

We were incorporated on November 5, 1998 in the State of Delaware under the name Concept Development Group, Inc. In May 2004, we acquired 100% of Kaleidoscope Venture Capital, Inc. (formerly Vocalscape Networks, Inc.) and changed our name to Vocalscape, Inc. In November 2005, we changed our name to Nevstar Precious Metals Inc . In September 2008, we changed our name to Deploy Technologies Inc. (“Deploy Tech”) and effective November 14, 2017, we changed our name to Body and Mind, Inc. (“Body and Mind”).

On September 15, 2010, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Deploy Acquisition Corp. (“Deploy”) under the laws of the State of Nevada, USA. On September 17, 2010, Deploy completed a merger with Deploy Tech, its former parent company, pursuant to which Deploy was the surviving corporation and assumed all the assets, obligations and commitments of Deploy Tech. Upon the completion of the merger Deploy assumed the name “Deploy Technologies Inc.” and all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Deploy Tech was automatically converted into and became Deploy’s – that is, our Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. 

On May 10, 2011, we registered as an extra-provincial company in British Columbia, and on September 30, 2011, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to designate 2,900,000 shares of our authorized capital stock as Class A Preferred Shares (the “Preferred Shares”). On September 2, 2014, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State increasing the authorized Preferred Shares from 2,900,000 shares to 20,000,000 shares. 

On November 11, 2014, we filed a certificate of change with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we reverse split our authorized as well as the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Common Shares”) on the basis of one (1) new share for ten (10) old shares. This resulted in a reduction of our authorized capital from 100,000,000 Common Shares to 10,000,000 Common Shares, and a reduction of our issued and outstanding Common Shares from 23,130,209 Common Shares to approximately 2,313,021 Common Shares. On April 11, 2017, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to increase the authorized capital from 10,000,000 Common Shares to 900,000,000 Common Shares.

Acquisition of Nevada Medical Group, LLC

On August 10, 2017, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Dep Nevada Inc. (“DEP”). On September 14, 2017, we, with DEP, entered into a definitive agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Nevada Medical Group, LLC (“NMG”), an arm’s length party, to carry out the business combination transaction initially announced on May 17, 2017, following the signing of the letter of intent between Toro Pacific Management Inc. (“Toro”) and NMG (the "Letter of Intent"), which was assigned to us pursuant to an assignment and novation agreement among Toro, NMG, and our Company dated effective May 12, 2017 (the “Assignment Agreement”). Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, Toro received 470,000 of our Common Shares. 

Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we changed our name to “Body and Mind, Inc.”, effective on November 14, 2017, by filing a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State; at the same time, we cancelled our entire authorized class of Preferred Shares. In addition, on November 14, 2017, we filed a certificate of change with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we reverse split our issued and outstanding Common Shares on the basis of one (1) new share for three (3) old shares (the “Consolidation”) which resulted in there being 28,239,876 Common Shares issued and outstanding post-Consolidation. DEP, our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of NMG in exchange for the issuance of our Common Shares on a post-Consolidation basis and certain cash and other non-cash consideration, as further described below (the "Acquisition"). Completion of the Acquisition resulted in a fundamental change under the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”). Subsequent to completion of the Acquisition, we filed articles of exchange with the Nevada Secretary of State.

We completed a concurrent equity financing to raise aggregate gross proceeds of CAD$6,007,429.89 through the issuance of subscription receipts (the “Subscription Receipts”), at a pre-Consolidation price of CAD$0.22 per Subscription Receipt (the “Concurrent Financing”). On November 14, 2017, each Subscription Receipt was exchanged in accordance with its terms, for no additional consideration, for one pre-Consolidation Common Share and one common share purchase warrant (each a “Warrant”) of the Company. Each Warrant is exercisable by the holder at a price of CAD$0.90 for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance. Each Warrant is subject to acceleration provisions following May 14, 2018, if the closing trading price of the Common Shares is equal to or greater than CAD$1.20 for seven consecutive trading days, at which time we may accelerate the expiry date of the Warrants by issuing a press release announcing the reduced warrant term whereupon the Warrants will expire 21 calendar days after the date of such press release.

In consideration for all of the issued securities of NMG, the NMG securityholders (collectively, the “NMG Members”) received, on a pro rata basis, (a) 16,000,000 post-Consolidation Common Shares (the “Payment Shares”) at a deemed price of CAD$0.66 per share (the “Share Exchange”), and (b) $2,000,000 cash. We also issued five non-interest bearing promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 (the “Promissory Notes”), as follows: we issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $450,000 to MBK Investments, LLC; we issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $450,000 to the Rozok Family Trust; we issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $490,000 to KAJ Universal Real Estate Investments, LLC; we issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $120,000 to NV Trees, LLC; and we issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $490,000 to SW Fort Apache, LLC. The Promissory Notes were secured by a senior priority security interest in all of our assets, and are due to be repaid at the earlier of fifteen (15) months from the closing date of the Acquisition, or, if an equity or debt financing subsequent to the Concurrent Financing were to be closed in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000, then within 30 days of the closing date of such subsequent financing. We assumed NMG’s obligations pursuant to a loan in the amount of $400,000, payable to TI Nevada, LLC, (“TI Nevada”) of which US$225,000 was paid on the Closing Date (as defined below) and the remaining $175,000, which was secured by a senior priority security interest in all of our assets, will be paid within 15 months of the Closing Date. Furthermore, we reimbursed NMG ($84,000) for expenditures incurred prior to the Closing Date which were related to the acquisition of production equipment. 

Any Payment Shares received by a “Related Person” (as defined in the CSE Policy 1) in connection with the Acquisition, and certain other Payment Shares as may be required by the CSE (“Escrow Shares”), are subject to escrow conditions prescribed by the CSE pursuant to the terms of an agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) entered into among us, the holders of Escrow Shares and New Horizon Transfer Inc., the escrow agent. Payment Shares received by the former members of NMG are subject to escrow under the rules and policies imposed by the CSE, and are further subject to voluntary pooling agreements entered into between us and the former members of NMG (the “Voluntary Pooling Agreements”), pursuant to which the Payment Shares will be released from pooling to the former members of NMG in accordance with the following schedule:


6 months after the Closing Date | 10% of the respective Payment Shares
---------------------------------+-------------------------------------
12 months after the Closing Date | 20% of the respective Payment Shares
18 months after the Closing Date | 25% of the respective Payment Shares
24 months after the Closing Date | 45% of the respective Payment Shares

The Acquisition closed on November 14, 2017 (the “Closing Date”). On completion of the Acquisition, we assumed the business of NMG, being the cultivation and production of medical marijuana products.

On December 18, 2017, we reached an agreement with a real estate investment group, led by NMG’s President, Robert Hasman, who intended to purchase a building adjacent to our existing facility and lease it back to a newly formed entity called Pepper Lane North LLC (“PLN” or “Partnership”) on a long-term basis with renewal options. PLN is a strategic partnership between the Company and a dispensary chain in the State of Nevada. The other PLN member intended to transfer an active cultivation license to the PLN facility and all expenditures under PLN were to be funded on a 50/50 basis by the PLN members. 

The new facility was expected to primarily consist of flowering rooms as production, packaging, distribution, and head office functions were to remain at the existing facility. We had also earmarked approximately 4,000 square feet of frontage for a dispensary upon receipt of a retail license. It was contemplated that at least half of the sales under PLN would be sold to the other PLN member through their existing dispensary network. In addition, we had signed an operating and management agreement with PLN and were to receive the greater of $15,000/month or 10% of PLN’s net profits. 

Prior to forming PLN, the members of PLN engaged surveyors to ensure compliance with permitting procedures and that PLN would receive the necessary approvals to move forward. Subsequent to January 31, 2018 we were notified that a church was located in close proximity of the building and that permitting was unlikely to proceed. We filed an insurance claim with the surveyor’s insurer to recover our out of pocket damages. As a result of these events, the lease and partnership agreements with PLN have been terminated. The company has decided not to legally pursue the claim against the survey company.

Convertible Loan and Management Agreements with Comprehensive Care Group LLC

On March 19, 2018, we, acting through our wholly-owned subsidiaries DEP and NMG, entered into a convertible loan agreement (the “Convertible Loan Agreement”) and a management agreement (the “Management Agreement”), respectively, with Comprehensive Care Group LLC (“CCG”), an Arkansas limited liability company, with respect to the development of a medical marijuana dispensary, 50 plant cultivation facility in West Memphis, Arkansas. Each of the Convertible Loan Agreement and the Management Agreement are effective as of March 15, 2019.

Pursuant to the Convertible Loan Agreement, DEP has agreed to make loan advances to CCG from time to time in the aggregate principal amount of up to $1,250,000. The loan proceeds are to be used to fund the construction of the medical marijuana dispensary facility, and to provide working capital to cover initial operating expenses. All pre-construction activities for the dispensary have been completed, and substantial construction progress has been made, with interior framing 90% complete in the dispensary and cultivation areas. Work is in-progress on roughing in chase ways for power upgrades while electrical rough-in remains ongoing throughout the project. Additionally, HVAC ductwork is 90% complete in the dispensary area.

The parties may mutually agree to adjust the amount of the loan to an increased amount or a lesser amount from time to time based on CCG’s reasonable operational and construction needs, as set forth in one or more budgets to be prepared by CCG and presented to DEP. The interest on outstanding advances will be fixed at a rate of $6,000 per month until such time as the parties mutually agree to increase the interest to a fixed rate of $10,000 per month, payable monthly in arrears on or before the first calendar day of each month commencing March 1, 2019. CCG is not obligated to repay any principal outstanding under the loan until March 30, 2021. Either CCG or DEP may unilaterally extend the maturity date by one year, and may thereafter continue to extend the maturity date on a yearly basis by increments of one year (each, an “Extension Option”) by providing written notice of the exercise of the Extension Option by the party seeking an extension to the other party; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall any extended maturity date extend beyond the expiration of the term of the Management Agreement entered into between NMG and CCG. 

Upon the latter of: (a) one year after granting of a medical marijuana dispensary license by the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission to CCG, or (b) one year after entering into the Convertible Loan Agreement, DEP may, in its sole discretion, subject to DEP providing all reasonable assistance to obtain all necessary approvals from the applicable government authorities to engage in the medical marijuana dispensary business, elect to convert all of the outstanding indebtedness into preferred units of CCG equal to 40% of the overall member units of CCG, subject to approval of the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission, with the following preferred rights: (i) the right to an allocative share of 66.67% of the net profits of CCG (as defined in the Convertible Loan Agreement) and the right to distributions equal to 66.67% of the net profits on a monthly basis; (ii) the right to a 66.67% share of CCG’s assets upon dissolution of CCG; and (iii) the right to 66.67% of all voting rights of members of CCG.

Pursuant to the Management Agreement, NMG has agreed to provide operations and management services to CCG, (including management, staffing, operations administration, oversight and other related services), in relation to CCG’s retail facility located in West Memphis, Arkansas. In consideration for such services, commencing on the effective date (March 15, 2019), CCG has agreed to pay NMG a monthly management fee in the amount equal to 66.67% of the Monthly Net Profits (as defined below) of CCG for the immediately-preceding month, all as determined in a manner mutually agreeable to NMG and CCG. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that DEP exercises its conversion right under the Convertible Loan Agreement, then NMG’s monthly management fee shall be fixed at $6,000.00 per month, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. For purposes of the Management Agreement, “Monthly Net Profits” means, for each calendar month, an amount equal to CCG’s gross revenue for such calendar month less CCG’s operating expenses (including all applicable expenses as set out under Section 2 of the Management Agreement, cost of goods sold, interest, and tax for said month), as reasonably determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The remaining 33.33% of the Monthly Net Profits is to be paid to CCG, which it, in its sole discretion, may distribute to its owners.

Acquisition of NMG Ohio LLC

At the time we acquired NMG, it already owned a 30% interest in NMG Ohio, LLC (“NMG Ohio”). On or around June 7, 2018, NMG Ohio was notified by the State of Ohio that it was awarded a medical cannabis dispensary license and a provisional production license. NMG Ohio has a cannabis dispensary carrying on business as “The Clubhouse” in Elyria, Loraine County, Ohio. On January 31, 2019, we through NMG entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 70% interest in NMG Ohio. The consideration for the remaining 70% interest in NMG Ohio is to consist of cash payments totaling $1,575,000 and 3,173,864 common shares of the Company. As at the date hereof, we have issued 2,380,398 of the 3,173,864 common shares with a fair value of $1,448,567, and paid approximately $600,000. Closing of the acquisition remains subject to receipt of regulatory approval.

Strategic Investment and Commercial Advisory Agreements with Australis Capital Inc.

On October 30, 2018, we entered into a strategic investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with Australis Capital Inc. (“Australis”), an Alberta corporation that has its common shares listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”), whereby Australis agreed to acquire:


(a) | 16,000,000 units of our Company, with each unit being comprised of one share of our common stock and one common share purchase warrant at a purchase price of CAD$0.40 per unit, for gross proceeds of CAD$6,400,000; and 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | CAD$1,600,000 principal amount 8% unsecured convertible debentures (the “Debentures”) of our Company having a maturity date of two years from the date of issue. The Debentures are convertible at the option of Australis into common shares of our Company at a conversion price equal to CAD$0.55 per common share up to the maturity date, subject to adjustment and acceleration in certain circumstances. If, at any time prior to the maturity date, the closing price of our common shares on the CSE (or such other stock exchange on which our common shares are then listed) is equal to or greater than CAD$1.65 for 20 consecutive trading days, our Company may force the conversion of the then outstanding principal amount of the debentures (and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon) at the then applicable conversion price on not less than 10 business days’ notice to Australis. On July 1, 2019, we entered into a conversion agreement with Australis, whereby Australis has agreed to convert the Debenture on July 1, 2020. Upon execution of the conversion agreement, we remitted CAD$148,339 to Australis as an advanced interest payment for the period from May 2, 2019 to July 1, 2020. Upon conversion of the Debenture, Australis will receive 2,909,091 Common Shares of our Company, to be issued at a deemed valued of CAD$0.55 per Common Share.


Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, we entered into a commercial advisory agreement (the “Commercial Advisory Agreement”) with Australis Capital (Nevada) Inc. (“Australis Nevada”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Australis, pursuant to which Australis Nevada has agreed to provide advisory and consulting services to our Company for a fee of $10,000 per month payable on the first day of each month for a term ending on the date that is the earlier of (i) five years following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement, and (ii) the date Australis no longer holds 10% or more of our Company’s issued and outstanding common shares. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement and subject to certain exceptions, Australis will be entitled to maintain its pro rata ownership interest of the Company until such time as it no longer holds 10% or more of our Company’s issued and outstanding common shares.

Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement and subject to applicable laws and the rules of the CSE, for as long as Australis owns at least 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Australis will be entitled to nominate one director for election to our Board of Directors of the Company. If Australis exercises all of its warrants and converts all of its debentures, Australis will be entitled to nominate a second director for election to our Board of Directors. Further, for as long as Australis maintains ownership of at least 25% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Australis will be entitled to maintain two directors on our Board of Directors, provided that each director nominee must meet the requirements of applicable corporate, securities and other laws and rules of the CSE. Mr. Scott Dowty, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Australis, was initially appointed as a director of our Company to replace then-existing board member Chris Macleod, upon closing of Australis’s strategic investment under the Investment Agreement on November 2, 2018, however, on October 16, 2019, Brent Reuter replaced Mr. Dowty as Australis’ nominee on our Board of Directors as Mr. Dowty resigned.

With respect to the proceeds from the financing, the Investment Agreement directed that the proceeds will only be used by our Company as follows, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Australis:


(a) | a maximum of CAD$400,000 to pay outstanding accounts payable, of which only CAD$300,000 was allowed to be used to pay an advisory fee to Canaccord Genuity Corp.; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transaction and Settlement with Green Light District Holdings Inc. – ShowGrow Long Beach and San Diego

Prior Agreement with Green Light District Holdings Inc.

On November 28, 2018, we entered into an interim agreement (the “Prior GLDH Agreement”) with Green Light District Holdings Inc. (“GLDH”), a private company incorporated under the laws of Delaware, and David Barakett, whereby our Company agreed to acquire up to 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of GLDH. We concurrently made a strategic investment in a senior secured convertible note issued by GLDH in the principal amount of $5,200,000 (the “Prior GLDH Note”), bearing interest at the rate of 20% per annum and maturing on November 28, 2020. 

GLDH is the owner of the ShowGrow dispensary brand, and owner of: 


(a) | the ShowGrow Long Beach dispensary, 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | 43% of the equity interest and 60% of the voting rights in the ShowGrow San Diego dispensary, and
(c) | 30% of the equity interest in the ShowGrow Las Vegas dispensary. 


GLDH is also the owner of the ShowGrow app. The dispensaries are in various stages of licensing: Long Beach has a medical and adult use commercial license, San Diego has a medical commercial cannabis retail conditional use permit, and Las Vegas has a recreational license. GLDH focuses on building dispensaries in high volume locations. 

In order to fund our Company’s original investment in GLDH, Australis advanced a $4,000,000 loan which is evidenced by a senior secured note dated November 28, 2018, bearing an interest rate of 15% per annum and maturing in two years. The terms require semi-annual interest payments unless we elect to accrue the interest by adding it to the principal amount of the debt facility. We may prepay the loan at any time, in any amount, subject to a 5% prepayment penalty on any amount repaid within the first year of the loan. Additionally, Australis exercised $1.2 million in warrants they held in our Company at an exercise price of CAD$0.50, which equated to 3,206,160 common shares. 

We paid a financing fee to Australis in the approximate amount of CAD$795,660, by issuing 1,105,083 common shares of our Company at a deemed price of CAD$0.72 per share. We also paid a financial advisory fee of CAD$150,000 in cash. 

Original Settlement and Release Agreement

On June 19, 2019, our Company, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, NMG Long Beach, LLC (“NMG Long Beach”), and our 60% owned subsidiary, NMG San Diego, LLC (“NMG San Diego”), entered into a settlement agreement (the “Original GLDH Settlement Agreement”) with GLDH, The Airport Collective, Inc. (“Airport Collective”), Mr. Barakett, and SGSD, LLC (“SGSD”). SGSD was the commercial tenant at 7625 Carroll Road, San Diego, California 92121 (the “San Diego Location”). 

Pursuant to the Original GLDH Settlement Agreement, our Company, GLDH, and Mr. Barakett agreed to restructure the Prior GLDH Agreement, and enter into a mutual release of all claims related to the Prior GLDH Agreement. 

In connection with the settlement, (a) SGSD agreed to assign its lease for the San Diego Location to NMG San Diego, and (b) GLDH, Airport Collective and NMG Long Beach have entered into an asset purchase agreement dated June 19, 2019 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which NMG Long Beach has agreed to purchase all of the assets of GLDH and Airport Collective utilized in the medical and adult-use commercial cannabis retail business at 3411 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach, CA 90804 (the “Long Beach Location”).

Amended and Restated Settlement and Release Agreement

On June 28, 2019, our Company, NMG Long Beach, NMG San Diego, GLDH, Airport Collective, Mr. Barakett, and SGSD entered into an amended and restated settlement and release agreement (the “Amended GLDH Settlement Agreement”) which supersedes and replaces the Original GLDH Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to the Amended GLDH Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed as follows:


i. | GLDH, Airport Collective, and Mr. Barakett have agreed to release our Company from all claims related to the Prior GLDH Agreement upon closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement in consideration of the following: 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | A. | our Company will pay Mr. Barakett or his designee USD$750,000 by issuing Common Shares at a price of CAD$0.7439 per share, with the number of shares being calculated with reference to a negotiated CAD/USD exchange rate of CAD1.3296:USD$1.00 (the “Agreed Foreign Exchange Rate”), for a total possible issuance of 1,340,502 Common Shares; such issuance is contingent on NMG San Diego receiving all licenses, permits, and authorizations required for NMG San Diego to conduct medical commercial cannabis retail operations at the San Diego Location (the “SD Medical Licenses”);
 | B. | our Company will pay Mr. Barakett or his designee USD$750,000 by issuing Common Shares at a price of CAD$0.7439 per share, with the number of shares being calculated with reference to the Agreed Foreign Exchange Rate for a total possible issuance of 1,340,502 Common Shares; such issuance is contingent on NMG San Diego receiving all licenses, permits, and authorizations required for NMG San Diego to conduct adult-use commercial cannabis retail operations at the San Diego Location (the “SD Adult-use Licenses”); and 
 | C. | our Company will pay certain legal and consulting expenses incurred by GLDH, Airport Collective and Barakett in an aggregate amount of US$90,500; and

NMG San Diego is owned 60% by the Company’s subsidiary, DEP Nevada, Inc. and 40% by SJJR, LLC (“SJJR”). Mr. Barakett has agreed to cover SJJR’s portion of all start-up costs associated with NMG San Diego establishing commercial cannabis operations at the San Diego Location, inclusive of: (i) the costs associated with becoming a tenant at the San Diego Location; and (ii) all construction costs associated with building out the San Diego Location for NMG San Diego’s operations. The share consideration payable to Mr. Barakett under the Amended GLDH Settlement Agreement is subject to reduction if Mr. Barakett fails to meet this obligation on a timely basis.

NMG San Diego, which has now assumed the lease on the ShowGrow San Diego premises, has applied for its own medical commercial cannabis retail license and adult-use commercial retail license, and is currently proceeding with construction associated with the build out of the San Diego premises to start operations in the near future. In consideration for the landlord, Green Road, LLC, agreeing to consent to the assignment of the original lease with SGSD to NGM San Diego, we agreed to provide the following consideration to the landlord:


i. | $700,000 in Common Shares of the Company calculated upon execution of the assignment and first amendment to commercial lease (the “Assignment and First Amendment”), dated June 13, 2019, at the maximum discount allowed by the CSE to be issued to the landlord immediately following execution of the Assignment and First Amendment;

ii. | $783,765.26 in cash to be paid to the landlord via bank draft within five (5) business days of execution of the Assignment and First Amendment; and 
iii. | $750,000 in cash, plus interest at the rate of five percent (5%) simple per annum accruing from the effective date to be paid no later than five (5) business days of the landlord’s receipt from the City of San Diego of a Conditional Use Permit allowing adult-use commercial cannabis storefront retail operations at the San Diego Location.


Pursuant to the Assignment and First Amendment, the parties agreed to amend the original lease to permit NMG San Diego to have three (3) five (5) year renewal options as opposed to two (2) renewal options. In addition, the parties agreed to reduce the amount of the sale bonus provision in the original lease to $1,000,000 from $2,000,000, which shall only be payable in connection with the first two assignments triggering this obligation, and thereafter, assignments will not require payment of a sale bonus. Furthermore, the parties also amended certain provisions of the original lease to ensure that any change in members representing less than fifty percent (50%) of the existing membership interests of NMG San Diego shall be an excluded transaction and not trigger the sale bonus or be deemed an assignment requiring consent of the landlord

If NMG San Diego is unable, through no fault of the GLDH, Airport Collective or Mr. Barakett, to receive its medical commercial cannabis retail license or its adult-use commercial cannabis retail license at the San Diego Location in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Amended Settlement Agreement, NMG San Diego and our Company will utilize best efforts to negotiate in good faith an amendment to the Amended Settlement Agreement satisfactory to all of the parties.

Amended and Restated Convertible Note and General Security Agreement

As contemplated by the Original GLDH Settlement Agreement, our Company and GLDH entered into a loan agreement dated June 19, 2019 (the “2019 GLDH Loan Agreement”), pursuant to which the Prior GLDH Note has been superseded and replaced with an amended and restated senior secured convertible note payable to the Company by GLDH in the principal amount of $5,200,000 (the “Amended and Restated GLDH Note”). The Amended and Restated GLDH Note bears interest at the rate of 20% per annum, compounded annually, and will mature and become repayable on June 19, 2022. GLDH’s obligations under 2019 GLDH Loan Agreement and the Amended and Restated GLDH Note have been guaranteed by Airport Collective, and are secured under a security agreement dated June 19, 2019 by all of GLDH’s and Airport Collective’s personal property, including but not limited to equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, cash or cash equivalents, and rights under contracts.
Asset Purchase Agreement

Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, NMG Long Beach has agreed to purchase all of GLDH’s and Airport Collective’s assets (the “Purchased Assets”) utilized in the retail cannabis business at the Long Beach Location for $6,700,000. Upon closing of the transaction, the outstanding principal amount under the Amended and Restated GLDH Note will be applied to the purchase price, and Airport Collective will be released from its obligations as a guarantor of the GLDH’s obligations under the Amended and Restated GLDH Note. 

The Company will pay the balance of the purchase price for the Purchased Assets by issuing up to 2,681,006 shares of common stock, to be issued at a deemed issue price of CAD$.0.7439 each; the number of shares required to pay and satisfy the balance of the purchase price for the Purchased Assets in the amount of $1,500,000 was determined with reference to the Agreed Foreign Exchange Rate of CAD$1.3296:USD$1.00. The purchase price – and therefore the amount of the share consideration - remains subject to reduction with reference to the liabilities of the business that will be outstanding on the closing date.

Trademark and Technology License and Services Agreement

In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement, our Company, and its affiliates and subsidiaries, will license certain intellectual property from Green Light District Management, LLC (“GLDM”), a Delaware limited liability company, and GLDH. The licenses consist of:


(a) | a perpetual license to utilize operational intellectual property, consisting of customer data, sales data, customer outreach strategies standard operating procedures, and other proprietary operational intellectual property; and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | a two-year license to utilize intellectual property such as trademarks and branding (the “Branding IP”). 


As consideration for the licenses, we have agreed to utilize the Branding IP until June 19, 2021 at the Long Beach Location, and at the San Diego Location for a period of two years from operations commencing at that location. Additionally, we have agreed to pay GLDM and GLDH 3% of gross receipts from sales at the Long Beach Location on a monthly basis for only the first twelve months of the term of the license agreement. We have agreed that, throughout the term of the license agreement, we will purchase all products and merchandise bearing the “ShowGrow” brand exclusively from GLDM. GLDM has agreed that it shall not itself utilize, nor allow any third-party to utilize, the Branding IP within a five mile radius of the Long Beach Location. GLDM has also agreed to provide certain services to our Company throughout the term of the license agreement.

Contemporaneous Loan

Our Company and GLDH have also entered into a contemporaneous loan (the “Contemporaneous Loan”) in the amount of $726,720.00 to fund certain business improvements and expansion needs of GLDH’s business operations. The Company and NMG Long Beach have agreed to forgive the Contemporaneous Loan on the date of closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

The closing under the Asset Purchase Agreement will not take place until NMG Long Beach has acquired local and state commercial cannabis licenses to conduct medical and adult-use commercial cannabis retail operations at the Long Beach Location. In the meantime, the parties have entered into a Management Assignment and Assumption Agreement, pursuant to which NMG Long Beach has assumed all management and control of the business operations at the Long Beach Location.


11

Management Assignment and Assumption Agreement

On or around August 1, 2019, NMG Long Beach began managing the ShowGrow Long Beach business pursuant to the management assignment and assumption agreement dated June 19, 2019, among NMG Long Beach, GLDH and Airport Collective. Under the agreement, NMG Long Beach is entitled to manage the business and recognize the profits from the business until NMG Long Beach receives its own commercial cannabis licenses and purchases the Purchased Assets in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Barakett Consulting Agreement 

In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement, NMG Long Beach and Mr. Barakett entered into a consulting agreement, dated June 19, 2019 (the “Consulting Agreement”), whereby NMG Long Beach has agreed to engage Mr. Barakett to provide certain consulting and advisory services in connection with running the business at the Long Beach Location and the San Diego Location.

In addition, NMG Long Beach has agreed to reimburse Mr. Barakett upon presentation of invoices for reasonable expenses which may be pre-authorized by NMG Long Beach from time to time.

Management and Administrative Services Agreement with Satellites Dip, LLC

On June 6, 2019, our Company, acting through our California subsidiary, NMG Cathedral City, LLC (“NMGCC”) entered into a management and administrative services agreement (the “California Management Agreement”) with Satellites Dip, LLC, a California limited liability company (“SD”) that is licensed to carry on commercial cannabis distribution and manufacturing operations within the state of California. Under the California Management Agreement, NMGCC has agreed to provide certain management and administrative services to SD, which may include, without limitation, the following: (i) management of operations; (ii) inventory management; (iii) equipment and physical plant maintenance; (iv) regulatory compliance; (v) payroll; (vi) human resources services; (vii) marketing services; (viii) information technology services; (ix) coordination of legal services; (x) coordination of tax services; (xi) coordination of accounting services; (xii) security services; (xiii) controlling the operating budget; (xiv) facility inspections; (xv) maintenance of detailed records and accounts related to SD’s business, and identification and tracking of key performance indicators; and (xvi) such other activities that NMGCC or SD determines in its reasonable judgment are necessary or desirable for the day-to-day operation or management of SD’s business. In consideration of such services, NMGCC will be paid a management fee equal to the greater of: (a) 30% of net profits (as such term is defined in the California Management Agreement); and (b) $10,000 per month. 

The initial term of the California Management Agreement will expire on June 6, 2020. The California Management Agreement may not be terminated prior to the expiry of the initial term, except in the case of a material breach that cannot reasonably be cured or remains uncured for 30 days after the non-breaching party provides written notice of the breach to the breaching party. Either party may, at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the initial term, provide notice in writing to the other party that it intends to renew the California Management Agreement for an additional one year term, but any such renewal will be subject to mutual agreement.

In addition, NMGCC agreed to broker commercial arrangements between SD and third-party cannabis brand owners, with the view to securing licenses for use in SD’s business. In particular, NMGCC agreed: (a) that, within 30 days of the effective date of the California Management Agreement, it would arrange for its affiliate company, NMG, to license certain trademarks and other intellectual property to SD for use relation to cannabis products to be manufactured by SD (the “Branded Products”) on terms at least as favorable as the most favored licensee; (b) to use good faith efforts to establish similar license agreements with third-party cannabis brand owners; and (c) to use good faith efforts to assist SD in the development of SD branded products in the event SD decides to create its own brand(s).

NMGCC has furnished equipment and machinery necessary for the manufacture of the Branded Products by SD. As contemplated by the California Management Agreement, NMGCC has leased such equipment and machinery to SD pursuant to an Equipment Lease Agreement between the parties dated June 6, 2019. The initial term of the Equipment Lease Agreement will expire on June 6, 2020. Either party may, at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the initial term, provide notice in writing to the other party that it intends to renew the Equipment Agreement for an additional one-year term, but any such renewal will be subject to mutual agreement. It is the intent of the parties that the monthly rent payable under the Equipment Lease Agreement be completely net to NMGCC, such that NMGCC will not be liable for any costs or expenses of any nature whatsoever relating to the equipment or any improvements to the equipment, or use of the equipment. SD is solely responsible for any such costs, charges, expenses, and outlays, including taxes, maintenance, and repairs. 


12


On September 12, 2019, our Company announced that SD’s Cathedral City facility has begun shipping certain Body and Mind products, following upon receipt of final testing and California packaging compliance certifications for such products. Initial product introductions include Lemon Brulee and Lemon Kush live resin sugar, Purple Punch blunts and Purple Punch pre-rolls. Live resin sugar is a concentrate, created using material that is fresh-frozen immediately upon harvesting.

In conjunction with entering into the California Management Agreement, the Company through NMGCC entered into a loan and security agreement dated June 6, 2019, whereby NMGCC has loaned SD US$250,000 to fund the property and business improvements and expansion needs of SD’s business operations. The loan will become due and payable on June 6, 2020, subject to extension by mutual agreement between the parties, and will bear interest at a rate of 12% per annum. Interest will accrue and be compounded quarterly, and will be payable by SD upon maturity of the loan. SD may prepay, in whole or in part, all or any portion of the principal amount and accrued interest on the loan without being subject to any pre-payment penalty. The loan is evidenced by a promissory note, and the performance of SD of its obligations under the loan agreement and the promissory note are secured pursuant to a security agreement.

Conditional Use Permit for Nevada Production Facility

On June 20, 2019, we announced the receipt of a conditional use permit from Clark County, Nevada, for a new production facility located within one mile of NMG’s existing cultivation facility located at 3375 Pepper Lane, in Las Vegas. The new facility will be located within an existing commercial building where our Company has secured a long-term lease. Architect plans are complete, and the space has been custom designed to produce edibles, oils and extracts at scale. The new facility will be approximately 7,500 square feet, and construction commenced in late July. The new facility plans include high-volume extraction equipment, which we expect will dramatically increase our manufacturing capacity and efficiency for our extraction products, including oils, wax, live resin and ambrosia. The new facility also expands the kitchen area and creates an opportunity for the Company to white label for brands seeking an entry to the Nevada market. The new production facility was anticipated to be operational in mid to late September 2019, pending license transfer approvals from local and state authorities. Substantial construction work has been advanced including completion of offices, boardroom and facilities which are being utilized by the Company. In addition, significant electrical, framing and HVAC work is complete and waiting for formal permitting and inspections required by the Clark County building department. Final inspections and permits are required prior to receiving license transfer approvals from local and state authorities. We plan to move our current production license eliminating the need to apply for a new license.

Past business of Deploy

Prior to the completion of the Acquisition, we were a development stage company engaged in designing and developing technologies and products for the management of truck fleets by companies in the freight haulage, waste haulage, mining, industrial operations and manufacturing, military and law enforcement industries.

We identified our proprietary technology and primary product by the name “Fleet Data Management & Weigh System”. The principal and unique feature of the Fleet Data Management & Weigh System enables operators of heavy industrial hydraulic lifting equipment to weigh cargo “on-the-fly” during the process of loading carrier vehicles. The load weight of trucks is important information for several purposes, including billing, compliance with highway and safety regulations and loading within capacity specifications. We designed and developed the Fleet Data Management & Weigh System to provide this information, as well as much more, on a real-time basis. The Fleet Data Management & Weigh System is capable of providing such information for in-cab entry and can deliver the information by wireless communication to operations centers, billing departments and for archival purposes, in order to meet the needs of any fleet operator.

Following the 2008 acquisition by our predecessor entity of the on-the-fly weigh system technology from Trepped Enterprises Inc., we devoted much of our time to engineering; circuit board design and testing; firmware and software development and testing; adding components and features; hardware selection; and improving, testing and packaging the Fleet Data Management & Weigh System. Upon the completion of our merger with Deploy Tech, we acquired the rights to both the technology and products that comprise the system by virtue of being the surviving corporation. 

We developed a final prototype of the products that comprise our Fleet Data Management & Weigh System. We have tested both prototype packages on various types of vehicles. We have experienced delays due to lack of required funding which resulted in less attention on sales and marketing than expected. 


13


Due to the large number of different vehicles and vehicle models that contain variations in parts, our system had to be tested on each variation of a vehicle before it can be sold to customers to ensure that it is properly calibrated for that specific vehicle. This significantly increases our testing and sales timelines. 

Throughout our 2014 fiscal year, our management was focused on sales of our products as well as raising capital required to achieve our sales and marketing goals. We were not successful in raising required capital to hire sales and marketing staff or launch a sales and marketing campaign and therefore restructured the company to be more attractive to the investment community. 

Although a lack of funding caused delays in sales and marketing efforts, we were able to remain current in our reporting obligations, including the year-end requirements to file our audited financial statements, MD&A and annual listing statement. 

Throughout our previous three years, we had developed and patented and had been selling our Fleet Data Management & Weigh System and prepared the Company for commercialization of our product line. We remain the owner of Patent # 2798525 which is titled as “Load-Measuring, Fleet Asset Tracking and Data Management System for Load-Lifting Vehicles.” While we continue to own and maintain this patent, our focus has changed to the business of cultivating and producing medical and adult-use recreational marijuana as further described below. We anticipate selling our patent in the foreseeable future and do not anticipate allocating any current or future resources to our prior business.

Our Products and Services

We cultivate and produce medical and adult-use recreational marijuana products such as cannabis flower, oil extracts and edibles under the brand name “Body and Mind”. We also produce products under license agreements.

We have built our business plan around capitalizing on the medical-use and recreational cannabis markets. The regulated medical and recreational use cannabis industry is a rapidly growing industry that presents a unique opportunity under current market conditions. In the United States, the development and growth of the industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation. Accordingly, the market varies on a state-by-state basis. State laws that legalize and regulate medical-use cannabis allow patients to consume cannabis for medicinal reasons with a doctor’s recommendation subject to various requirements and limitations. States have authorized numerous medical conditions as qualifying conditions for treatment with medical-use cannabis, including but not limited to treatment for cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, wasting syndrome, pain, nausea, seizures, muscle spasms, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), migraines, arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, lupus, residual limb pain, spinal cord injuries, inflammatory bowel disease and terminal illness. 

As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, 31 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing their residents to use medical cannabis.

We believe that the following conditions create an attractive opportunity for the cultivation and production of products within the medical and recreational use cannabis industry:


· | Significant industry growth in recent years and expected continued growth; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | A shift in public opinion and increasing momentum toward the legalization of cannabis; 
· | Limited access to capital by industry participants in light of risk perceived by financial institutions of violating federal laws and regulatory guidelines for offering banking services to cannabis-related businesses;
· | NMG is currently in the process of obtaining a recreational distribution license; 
· | NMG currently has three main product lines: (i) flower, (ii) edibles, and (iii) extracts; and 
· | NMG currently cultivates recreational marijuana. 

  Notwithstanding the foregoing market opportunity and trends, and despite legalization at the state level, we continue to believe that the current state of federal law creates significant uncertainty and potential risks associated with investing in medical-use and recreational-use cannabis facilities.

We use a state licensed distribution company to distribute our products and our primary market is in State of Nevada.

Our Strategy

Body and Mind’s strategy is focused on a platform approach to expansion which focuses on limited license states and jurisdictions. We work to maximize shareholder value through:

1) Production and distribute Body and Mind branded products (production and/or cultivation);

2) Use excess production capacity to produce and distribute synergistic third party brands;

3) Own or operate strategic retail stores for vertical integration; and

4) Enter new markets though lower cost applications and opportunistic / targeted acquisitions . 

We have a track record of award-winning cannabis strains, flower and extracts and as early entrants to the Nevada market management has experience with writing license applications, cultivating and operating efficiently and working within a strict metric or track and trace environment. 

We have developed the premium, marquis lifestyle “Body and Mind” brand in Nevada with strong penetration into dispensaries and have recently expanded the brand to dispensaries in California. The Body and Mind brand appeals to a wide range of cannabis consumers with products including oils, extracts (wax, live resin, ambrosia) and edibles.

We have a long track record of producing award-winning cannabis products and we have success with licensing to manufacture for brands. We currently produced cannabis oil cartridges for Gpen, a well known vaporizer manufacturer. We are in the process of developing a larger production facility and are in preliminary discussions with several cannabis brands who may be interested in having Body and Mind produce their brand and products under license in Nevada.

NMG was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 3, 2014. NMG was an early applicant in Nevada in 2014 and was awarded one of the first state medical licenses for both cultivation and production of marijuana. NMG has been a licensed producer and cultivator of cannabis products since it was issued its first cultivation license on November 5, 2015 and production license on December 10, 2015. On July 1, 2017, NMG was awarded an additional state recreational cultivation and production license. NMG produces cannabis flower, oil extracts and edibles, which are available for sale under the brand name “Body & Mind” in dispensaries in Nevada. 

NMG anticipates an increase in demand due to the recently approved “Adult Use” licensing in the State of Nevada that began in July 2017. NMG has several growth initiatives underway including new product introductions, product licensing, third party extraction, out-of-State licensing, and acquisitions.

Since our acquisition of NMG, as discussed in more detail above, we have been focused on:

(1) improving NMG’s existing facility;

(2) increasing product availability; and

(3) lowering production costs.

Improvements to NMG’s Existing Facility

On June 28, 2018, we obtained a building permit from Clark County, Nevada to add new flowering rooms and expand our packaging area. Each new flowering room was outfitted with rolling benches and watering systems and the project was completed with final Certificates of Occupancy awarded in September 2018. The new flowering rooms have been in production since September 2018 and are included in the perpetual harvest program for all cultivation in the existing facility. Additionally, a carbon dioxide system has been installed and is now being used throughout the facility. Upon the completion of the Nevada production facility the company anticipates renovating the existing production areas of the facility. The existing production and kitchen areas are anticipated to be renovated for additional flower space.

Increased Product Availability

We focused on flower and developing top end strains during the early years of our business. When Nevada was a medical only market we performed significant research on edibles with products including granola bars, beef jerky, hard candies and gummies. We also performed a great deal of research on extraction with products ranging from shatter, rosin, distillate and raw oil. 

15


As adult recreation rules changed the products that could be produced, we have focused on increasing our product offerings and licensing opportunities. We have determined that the edible market is a sector of the marijuana industry with a high profit margin. To capitalize on this, we have made a dedicated effort to hire an individual with an extensive background in confectionary products and proper dosing techniques. Since hiring this individual on March 6, 2018, we have maintained a consistent passing of all state-mandated testing of our edibles regarding dosing.

In addition, we have implemented improved recipes of our established edible products which has increased our product’s shelf life and improved taste. We have developed preparation recipes for our Pretzel Bites which is our top selling edible product and we have implemented an improved recipe for our gummies products. 

We continually work on research for new edible products and developing recipes. 

Lowering Our Production Costs

As cannabis flower continues to be the foundation product for the marijuana industry, we are striving for continuous improvement to our cultivation process. Our aim will always focus on increasing the production yields of each harvest, and to obtain the highest quality product harvest. Doing so achieves two things for us and our customers: (1) allows us to maximize our profit; and (2) gives our customers the best value for their dollar by offering highly potent THC products.

As of September 2018, we have three additional grow rooms operating which has increased our overall flower production. We have a record-keeping system in place to aid us in selecting flower strains that produce the largest yields and the highest THC. Our record-keeping system tracks room metrics, nutrient intake of the plants, and other vital metrics which helps us identify the best possible conditions for the plant to maximize its yield. We have introduced a perpetual harvest system to increase efficiency and allow for a steady supply of cannabis.

We have completed the process of installing separate HVAC units for each cultivation area throughout our facility. A centralized control system has been put in place to provide real-time information and control for all HVAC units in the facility. This system helps us track each room’s environmental metrics and help us maintain a proactive response in the event of any equipment failure. In addition to the centralized AC control system, we have completed installation of a CO2 system in our grow rooms. This CO2 system pumps carbon dioxide into the grow rooms which we expect to increase our flower yields by approximately 20-30 per cent. We have also completed installation of measurement devices for temperature, carbon dioxide, and humidity levels in each grow room. This will give us a real time reading of our grow rooms, allowing us to make adjustments in real time. 

We commenced yield and production research with several brands of LED lights in October 2019. The research comprises of growing various strains under both conventional and new LED lighting systems. Data is gathered on the yield, strength and cultivation time under each light source to evaluate the efficacy of various LED lighting systems.

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates all food and food ingredients introduced into or offered for sale in interstate commerce (with the exception of meat, poultry, and certain processed egg products). At this time, our edible food products are not introduced into or offered for sale in interstate commerce, and FDA approval of our edible products is not required. However, we must, and do, comply with food labeling requirements set forth by the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) and the Nevada Department of Taxation, which include: a statement of identity, net quantity of contents, ingredient statement, manufacturer information, nutritional labeling, “use-by” date, safe handling instructions, an allergen statement, “Keep out of reach of children” statement, “THIS IS A MARIJUANA PRODUCT” statement, cannabinoid profile, terpenoid profile, total amount of THC, our production license number, production run number, date of production, date of final testing, date on which the product was packaged, etc. 

Our operations as a licensed cultivator and producer of marijuana and marijuana products could be found in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act. Due to this, we may face higher federal income tax liability as it is subject to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a cannabis company from deducting any expenses from their income on its federal income tax return, except for those considered to be cost of goods sold (COGS). While this severely impacts marijuana retailers, as opposed to cultivators and producers, we do face higher federal income tax liability than a non-cannabis company.


16


The State of Nevada, per Nevada Revised Statutes Section 372A.290, has implemented the following taxes on marijuana and marijuana products: (i) a fifteen percent (15%) excise tax on the wholesale sale which is paid by the cultivator and is calculated on the fair market value at wholesale set by the Department of Taxation, and (ii) a ten percent (10%) excise tax on the retail sale which is paid by the retail store. We are obligated to collect and remit the wholesale cultivation tax on all wholesale sales and file the appropriate tax returns on a monthly basis. We currently do not have retail operations in Nevada, and therefore are not required to collect and/or remit any retail taxes. All marijuana and marijuana products sold at retail must also pay and remit sales taxes at the applicable local sales tax level.

Supply & Demand - as our competitors expand operations, there is more supply creating less demand for mid and low quality cannabis products. We continue to provide high quality products, excellent customer service, and competitive prices.

We have built our business plan around capitalizing on the medical-use and recreational cannabis market. The regulated medical-recreational use cannabis industry is a rapidly growing industry that presents a unique opportunity under current market conditions. In the United States, the development and growth of the industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation, and accordingly, the market varies on a state-by-state basis. As of the date hereof, 31 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing their citizens to use medical cannabis.

We believe that the following conditions create an attractive opportunity for the cultivation, production and retail sales of products within the medical recreational-use cannabis industry:


· | Significant industry growth in recent years and expected continued growth; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | A shift in public opinion and increasing momentum toward the legalization of cannabis; 
· | Limited access to capital by industry participants in light of risk perceived by financial institutions of violating federal laws and regulatory guidelines for offering banking services to cannabis-related businesses;
· | Opportunity for skilled operators to transfer operational and execution experience to new facilities and operations. 


18

   Notwithstanding the foregoing market opportunity and trends, and despite legalization at the state level, we continue to believe that the current state of federal law creates significant uncertainty and potential risks associated with investing in medical-use and recreational-use cannabis facilities.

We use a state licensed distribution company to distribute our products and our primary market is in State of Nevada.

Product Regulation

State laws that legalize and regulate medical-use cannabis allow patients to consume cannabis for medicinal reasons with a doctor’s recommendation subject to various requirements and limitations. In Nevada, an applicant of a medical-use cannabis card must obtain verification from attending provider of health care that the person has been diagnosed with a chronic or debilitating medical condition, and its symptoms may be mitigated by the medical use of marijuana. Nevada has characterized the following as “chronic or debilitating medical conditions”: acquired immune deficiency syndrome; cancer, glaucoma, a medical condition or treatment for a medical condition that produces cachexia, persistent muscle spasms, seizures, severe nausea, or severe pain. The above list may be amended or added to from time to time. Nevada extends reciprocity for non-residents who hold a valid medical-use card in their state of residence, as long as the person abides by Nevada’s legal limits on the possession. Medical-use card holders may not possess more than two and one-half ounces of usable marijuana in any one 14-day period.

In Ohio, patients must have a qualifying medical condition to be eligible for a medical-use card. Such qualifying medical conditions include: HIV/AIDS; Alzheimer's disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); cancer; chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); Crohn's disease; epilepsy or another seizure disorder; fibromyalgia; glaucoma; hepatitis C; inflammatory bowel disease; multiple sclerosis; pain that is chronic and severe, or intractable; Parkinson's disease; post-traumatic stress disorder; sickle cell anemia; spinal cord disease or injury; Tourette's syndrome; traumatic brain injury; and ulcerative colitis. Ohio prohibits smoking of medical-use cannabis, but permits oils, tinctures, plant material, edibles and patches. Ohio medical-use card holders may not possess more than a 90-day supply of medical marijuana, which is defined by form, as follows: plant material- no more than eight ounces of tier I medical marijuana, no more than five and three-tenths ounces of tier II medical marijuana; no more than twenty-six and fifty-five-hundredths grams of THC content in patches for transdermal administration or lotions, creams, or ointments for topical administration; no more than nine and nine-tenths grams of THC content in oil, tincture, capsule, or edible form for oral administration; no more than fifty-three and one-tenths grams of THC content in medical marijuana oil for vaporization.

In November 2016, California and Nevada voters both approved cannabis use for adults over the age of 21 without a physician’s prescription or recommendation, and permitted the cultivation and sale of marijuana, in each case subject to certain limitations. We have obtained the necessary permits and licenses to expand our existing business to cultivate and distribute cannabis in compliance with the laws in the State of Nevada and California. Despite the changes in state laws, cannabis remains illegal under federal law. In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which is also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“the AUMA”), in a ballot initiative. Among other things, the AUMA makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to 28.5 grams of marijuana flowers and 8 grams of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, the AUMA establishes a licensing system for businesses to, among other things, cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. On January 1, 2018, the California Bureau of Marijuana Control enacted regulations to implement the AUMA. Nevada voters approved Question 2 in a ballot initiative in November 2016. Among other things, Question 2 makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, Question 2 authorizes businesses to cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions.

The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits.

We are monitoring the current federal administration’s, the DOJ’s and Congress’ positions on federal marijuana law and policy. Since the beginning of the new Congress in January 2019, there have been positive discussions about the Federal Government’s approach to cannabis. The DOJ has not signaled any change in their enforcement efforts. Based on public statements and reports, we understand that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and adult use is permitted in California and Nevada, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable Nevada, California, Ohio and Arkansas laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
