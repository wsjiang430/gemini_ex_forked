Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a science-led global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically-differentiated medicines that provide benefits to patients with rare disorders. Our ability to globally commercialize products is the foundation that drives our continued investment in a robust pipeline of transformative medicines and our mission to provide access to best-in-class treatments for patients who have an unmet medical need. 
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to bring best-in-class therapies with differentiated clinical benefit to patients affected by rare disorders and to leverage our global commercial infrastructure to maximize value for our patients and other stakeholders.

• | Global DMD Franchise - We have two products, Translarna™ (ataluren) and Emflaza™ (deflazacort), for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, a rare, life threatening disorder. Translarna received marketing authorization from the European Commission in August 2014 for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or nmDMD, in ambulatory patients aged five years and older in the 31 member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA. In July 2018, the European Commission renewed our marketing authorization, which is subject to annual renewal and other conditions, and approved a label-extension to our marketing authorization to include patients from two to five years of age. During fiscal year 2018, Translarna achieved net sales of $171.0 million and is currently available for the treatment of nmDMD in over 40 countries. Emflaza is approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older. During fiscal year 2018, Emflaza achieved net sales of $92.0 million.


• | Gene Therapy Platform - We have a pipeline of gene therapy product candidates for rare monogenic diseases that affect the central nervous system, or CNS, including PTC-AADC for the treatment of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase, or AADC, deficiency, a rare CNS disorder arising from reductions in the enzyme AADC that result from mutations in the dopa decarboxylase gene. We are preparing a biologics license application, or BLA, for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States, which we anticipate submitting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in late 2019, with an anticipated commercial launch in the United States in 2020. We are also preparing a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the European Union, or EU, for submission to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, which will follow our BLA submission to the FDA.


• | Akcea Partnership - We hold the rights for the commercialization of Tegsedi™ (inotersen) and Waylivra™ (volanesorsen) for the treatment of rare diseases in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean pursuant to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Akcea Therapeutics, Inc., or Akcea. Tegsedi has received marketing authorization in the United States, EU and Canada for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, and was recently granted priority review by Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária, or ANVISA, the Brazilian health regulatory authority. Waylivra is currently under regulatory review in the EU for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS.


• | Splicing Platform - We also have a spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, collaboration with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffman-La Roche Inc., which we refer to collectively as Roche, and the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation, or SMA Foundation. Currently, our collaboration has two pivotal clinical trials ongoing to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of risdiplam (RG7916, RO7034067), the lead compound in the SMA program. Roche is preparing an NDA and a MAA for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA in the United States and the EU, respectively, which Roche anticipates submitting to the FDA and the EMA in the second half of 2019.


• | Pursuing Value-Creation Opportunities - In April 2017, we acquired all rights to Emflaza from Marathon Pharmaceuticals, LLC (now known as Complete Pharma Holdings, LLC), or Marathon. In August 2018, we acquired our gene therapy platform for rare monogenic diseases that affect the CNS through our acquisition of Agilis Biotherapeutics, Inc., or Agilis. Also in August 2018, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Akcea for the commercialization of TegsediTM (inotersen), WaylivraTM (volanesorsen) and products containing those compounds in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. As part of our business strategy, we may engage in further strategic transactions to expand and diversify our product pipeline, including through the acquisition of assets, businesses, or rights to products, product candidates or technologies or through strategic alliances or collaborations. 

Our Pipeline
In addition to our commercial products, we have a pipeline of product candidates and discovery programs at various stages of development, including clinical, pre-clinical and research and discovery stages, focused on the development of new treatments 
4

for multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases and oncology. The chart below summarizes the status of our more advanced programs as of the date of this report, including those with our strategic partners:
Gene Therapy Platform
Our gene therapy platform focuses on the development of innovative therapies for rare, debilitating diseases of the CNS. Our lead gene therapy product candidate is PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency. AADC deficiency is a rare CNS disorder arising from reductions in the enzyme AADC that result from mutations in the dopa decarboxylase gene. AADC is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of L-dopa to dopamine. Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter that acts within the striatum (caudate and putamen), a component of the brain’s deep grey matter, to modulate output of neurons that project to the motor and premotor cortices of the brain that plan and execute normal motor function. Dopamine is required in the brain for humans to develop and maintain proper motor function.
AADC deficiency is a monogenic disorder of neurotransmitter synthesis that manifests in young children and most commonly results in profound developmental delay, often seen as complete arrest of motor development. AADC deficiency generally causes the inability to develop motor control, resulting in breathing, feeding, and swallowing problems, frequent hospitalizations, and the need for life-long care. On average, patients with AADC deficiency die in the first decade of life due to profound motor dysfunction and secondary complications such as choking, hypoxia, and pneumonia. Currently, no treatment options are available for the underlying cause of the disorder, and care is limited to palliative options with significant burden on caregivers.
The prevalence of AADC deficiency has been estimated to be approximately 5,000 patients worldwide, with a live-birth incidence of approximately 1 in 40,000 worldwide. While several diagnostic tests for AADC deficiency are available, the condition remains largely misdiagnosed or undiagnosed.
PTC-AADC is an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, gene therapy, which has been assessed in two completed clinical trials, and one trial in which enrollment and dosing is ongoing. The two completed trials include a total of 18 children with severe AADC deficiency who were treated with a one-time total dose of 1.8 x 1011 vg of PTC-AADC during a single procedure in which the gene therapy was administered directly to the region of the brain where dopamine is made and released, called the putamen. The targeted micro-dosing approach administering small amounts of gene therapy directly to focal regions of affected cells in the putamen has the benefit of keeping the supply requirements for materials low, improving access of the therapeutic gene to key cells, potentially limiting immune and complement-mediated responses and reducing the risk of off-target uptake and excretion of the gene therapy by the liver and kidneys. To date, results from these trials suggest that patients may have a gain of motor functions and improvement in cognitive scales following gene therapy administration and have shown significant increases in motor function, which contrasts with the published natural history.
The two completed clinical trials, AADC-1601, a trial in which patients were enrolled under individual compassionate use consents, and AADC-010, were both single-arm, open-label, interventional trials that enrolled a total of 18 patients. The primary and secondary objectives of these trials were to assess the safety and efficacy of PTC-AADC administered via bilateral putaminal‑infusions in patients with severe AADC deficiency at a total one-time dose of 1.8 x 1011 vg. Study enrollment required a diagnosis of AADC deficiency, defined as decreased homovanilic acid, or HVA, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, or 5‑HIAA, and elevated L-Dopa cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, levels, presence of more than one DDC gene mutation, and presence of clinical 
5

symptoms of AADC deficiency (including developmental delay, hypotonia, dystonia, and oculogyric crisis), and patient age of older than 2 years.
Patients were evaluated monthly for safety assessments and every three months for efficacy assessments that included tests of motor developmental testing (Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, Second Edition, or PDMS-2, and Alberta Infant Motor Scale, or AIMS) through the first year after treatment with PTC-AADC and at periodic intervals thereafter through five years following treatment. The PDMS-2 and AIMS are validated scales used to assess motor skills in young children. Pharmacodynamic testing of CNS AADC activity over time included analyses of CSF neurotransmitter metabolites and FDOPA PET imaging intervals, also through five years.
8 patients were enrolled in the AADC-1601 study. 10 patients were enrolled in the AADC-010 study. In both studies, the average age of patients was less than 5 years of age.
At baseline, patients had no functional movement and failed to achieve any motor milestones, including head control, sitting or standing capabilities, consistent with the published natural history of severe AADC deficiency. Compared to baseline, at one-year and at five-years after PTC-AADC administration, patients had objective evidence of de novo dopamine production as visualized by F-DOPA PET imaging of the brain, consistent with successful and stable gene expression and enzyme activity over time.
Based on preliminary analysis, following administration of PTC-AADC, the combined group of patients showed significant improvements from baseline capabilities at one-year post-treatment in functional motor skills assessed with the PDMS-2 total score, as well as on the locomotion, grasping, visual-motor integration and stationary subscales. Significant improvements from baseline at one-year post-treatment were also observed for the combined group of patients on the AIMS total score and on the prone, supine, sit and stand subscales.
Compared to published natural history data, patients in these trials showed statistically significant improvements at both two- and five-year post-treatment in achievement of motor milestones of full head control (at 2 and 5 years), sitting unassisted (at 2 and 5 years) and standing with support (at 5 years), reinforcing the clinical benefit and sustainability of functional motor improvements.
Surgical injection of PTC-AADC in both completed trials was well tolerated, with no adverse events occurring during the surgical procedure. Adverse events were generally associated with the disease state. The most frequent adverse event associated with PTC-AADC was dyskinesia and these events completely resolved over time. No serious adverse events have been attributed to PTC-AADC.
The ongoing clinical trial, AADC-011, is a single-center, open-label trial to assess the efficacy and safety of PTC-AADC in patients with AADC deficiency. The primary outcomes for this trial include assessing a change in the PDMS-2 score and measuring the change in the neurotransmitter metabolite HVA or 5-HIAA in the cerebrospinal fluid. A total of 10 patients is planned for recruitment, of which 8 have been enrolled and treated to date. With these 8 patients, we now have 26 patients from our three trials being evaluated in safety and efficacy studies. 
An end-of-phase 2 meeting was held with the FDA in July 2017, and the clinical, non-clinical and chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, data available to date from the two completed clinical trials were reviewed. The FDA provided feedback indicating that the clinical and non-clinical data available to date were sufficient to support the submission of a BLA without undertaking additional trials or studies at this time. Based on the FDA input, including with respect to manufacturing, we are preparing a BLA for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States, which we anticipate submitting to the FDA in late 2019, with an anticipated commercial launch in the United States in 2020. PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency has orphan drug designation in the United States and EU, and rare pediatric disease designation in the United States, and upon BLA approval the FDA may grant us a priority review voucher.
In April 2018, a protocol assistance meeting was held with the Scientific Advice Working Party of the EMA in anticipation of the expected submission of a MAA in the EU and received feedback indicating the clinical and non-clinical data available to date were sufficient to support the submission of an MAA without undertaking additional trials or studies at this time. We are preparing an MAA for the treatment of AADC deficiency with PTC-AADC in the EU, which we plan to submit to the EMA following our BLA submission to the FDA. Based on the FDA’s input and feedback from the EMA, we do not deem necessary and do not plan to conduct a Phase 3 trial for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency.
There is no guarantee that we will be able to make the BLA or MAA submissions within our expected timelines or that following such submissions, the FDA or EMA would not have additional comments or requirements with respect to the respective submissions that we would be required to address before obtaining regulatory submission and approval, or that the FDA, the EMA or any other regulatory authority will approve PTC-AADC for treatment of AADC deficiency at all.
If PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency receives FDA approval, we expect that PTC-AADC would have a twelve-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for the approved indication, commencing on the date of FDA approval, under the provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, as well as a concurrent seven-year exclusive marketing period, which would commence on the date of FDA approval, under the provisions of the Orphan Drug Act of 
6

1983, or Orphan Drug Act. We are pursuing patent protection for PTC-AADC, and, in the meantime, we expect to rely on the twelve-year BPCIA regulatory exclusivity and concurrent seven-year Orphan Drug Act exclusivity to commercialize PTC-AADC in the United States, if it is approved. Due to its orphan designation in the EMA, we anticipate that PTC-AADC would have similar market exclusivities in the EU, if it is approved. 
See “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-The new drug and biologic approval process” below for further discussion with respect to the BLA and MAA process. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Gene Therapy Platform” and “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates” for further detail regarding the related risks to the development, regulatory process and commercialization of gene therapy products.
Our gene therapy platform also includes a gene therapy asset targeting Friedreich ataxia, a rare and life-shortening neurodegenerative disease caused by a single defect in the FXN gene which causes reduced production of the frataxin protein. We expect to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA for this program in late 2019. Additionally, the gene therapy platform includes two other gene therapy programs targeting CNS disorders, including Angelman syndrome, a rare, genetic, neurological disorder characterized by severe developmental delays. We expect to submit an IND to the FDA for this program in 2020.
Global DMD Franchise
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
Muscular dystrophies are genetic disorders involving progressive muscle wasting and weakness. DMD is the most common and one of the most severe types of muscular dystrophy. DMD occurs when a mutation in the dystrophin gene prevents the cell from making a functional dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is a muscle membrane associated protein and is critical to the structural and membrane stability of muscle fibers in skeletal, diaphragm and heart muscle. The absence of normally functioning dystrophin results in muscle fragility, such that muscle injury occurs when muscles contract or stretch during normal use. As muscle damage progresses, connective tissue and fat replace muscle fibers, resulting in inexorable muscle weakness.
Because the dystrophin gene is located on the X chromosome, DMD occurs primarily in young boys, although approximately 10% of female carriers show some disease symptoms. DMD is rare, and estimates of occurrence include approximately 1 in every 3,500 live male births, according to Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy and approximately 1 in every 5,000 live male births according to Ryder (2017) in the European Journal of Human Genetics. We estimate that there are between approximately 10,000 and 15,000 DMD patients in the United States. Several different types of mutation in the dystrophin gene can result in DMD, including deletion, duplication and nonsense mutations. A test known as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) can detect large deletions and duplications, which account for approximately 75% of all mutations. However, gene sequencing is required to identify small mutations such as nonsense mutations. We estimate that nonsense mutations account for approximately 13% of cases of DMD. Without treatment, patients with DMD typically lose walking ability by their early teens, require ventilation support in their late teens, and eventually experience premature death due to heart and lung failure. Even with medical care, most people with DMD die from cardiac or respiratory failure before or during their 30s.
Marketing authorization matters
Translarna for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy
European Economic Area
We received marketing authorization from the European Commission in August 2014 for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older in the 31 member states of the EEA, subject to annual renewal and other conditions. In July 2018, the European Commission approved a label-extension request to our marketing authorization for Translarna in the EEA to include patients from two to up to five years of age. In September 2018, we submitted to the EMA a label-extension request to our marketing authorization in the EEA to include patients who are non-ambulatory. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully obtain such label extension. In July 2018, the European Commission renewed our marketing authorization, making it effective, unless extended, through August 5, 2019. In February 2019, we submitted a marketing authorization renewal request to the EMA. 
The conditional marketing authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of continued authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment, as well as our satisfaction of any specific obligation or other requirement placed upon the marketing authorization, including Study 041, a three-year clinical trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of Translarna.
In January 2016, we submitted the final clinical study report from our Phase 3 clinical trial in nmDMD (referred to as ACT DMD) to the EMA in fulfillment of the initial specific obligation placed on our marketing authorization. The primary efficacy endpoint of ACT DMD was not achieved with statistical significance. We made our submission to the EMA as a type II variation request that sought to have this initial specific obligation to our marketing authorization removed and a full marketing authorization granted. In February 2016, we also submitted a marketing authorization renewal request with the EMA.
7

The European Commission’s renewal of our marketing authorization in January 2017 was based on the totality of the clinical data available from our trials and studies of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, including the safety and efficacy results of our Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials, and our commitment to conduct and submit the results of Study 041 to the EMA by the end of the third quarter of 2021. Due to enrollment at a slower pace in certain countries than initially expected, in our February 2019 marketing authorization renewal request, we asked the EMA to extend the timeframe for submission of the results of Study 041 to the EMA to the end of the third quarter of 2022. The trial is comprised of two stages: an 18-month randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial followed by an 18-month open label extension period. See “Item 1. Business-Planned and ongoing clinical development of Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy-Study 041” for further information regarding the specific obligation to the marketing authorization in the EEA. The authorization remains subject to the annual EMA reassessment, as the EMA did not grant our request for full marketing authorization. 
Marketing authorization is required in order for us to engage in any commercialization of Translarna in the EEA, including through participation in the market access process and related pricing and reimbursement negotiations, on a country-by-country basis with each country in the EEA, and is also required to make Translarna available under early access programs, or EAP programs. There is substantial risk that if we are unable to renew our EEA marketing authorization during any annual renewal cycle, if our product label is materially restricted, or if Study 041 does not provide the data necessary to maintain our marketing authorization, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna in the EEA and other territories.
See “Item 1. Business-Commercial Matters-Market Access Considerations” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates” and “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates” for further information regarding the marketing authorization in the EEA, the market access process and related risks.
As the marketing authorization holder, we are obligated to monitor the use of Translarna for nmDMD to detect, assess and take required action with respect to information that could impact the safety profile of Translarna and to report this information, through pharmacovigilance submissions, to the EMA. Following its assessment of these submissions, the EMA can recommend to the European Commission actions ranging from the continued maintenance of the marketing authorization to its withdrawal.
United States
Translarna is an investigational new drug in the U.S. During the first quarter of 2017, we filed a New Drug Application, or NDA, for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD over protest with the FDA. In October 2017, the Office of Drug Evaluation I of the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the NDA, stating that it was unable to approve the application in its current form. In response, we filed a formal dispute resolution request with the Office of New Drugs of the FDA. In February 2018, the Office of New Drugs of the FDA denied our appeal of the Complete Response Letter. In its response, the Office of New Drugs recommended a possible path forward for our ataluren NDA submission based on the accelerated approval pathway. This would involve a re-submission of an NDA containing the current data on effectiveness and safety of ataluren with new data to be generated on dystrophin production in nmDMD patients’ muscles. We intend to follow the FDA’s recommendation and will collect, using newer technologies via procedures and methods that we designed, such dystrophin data in a new study, Study 045, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect that a potential re-submission of an NDA could occur in 2020. Additionally, should a re-submission of an NDA receive accelerated approval, the Office of New Drugs stated that Study 041, which is currently enrolling, could serve as the confirmatory post-approval trial required in connection with the accelerated approval pathway.
There is substantial risk that Study 045, or any other studies we may use to collect the dystrophin data, will not provide the necessary data to support a marketing approval for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the U.S.
See “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-The new drug and biologic approval process” below for further discussion with respect to the NDA process. See “Item 1. Business-Translarna™ (ataluren)” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates” and “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates” for further detail regarding the results of our completed trials and studies of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, our regulatory strategy in the United States, our history with submissions to the FDA and the related risks to our business.
Other Territories
Translarna received marketing authorization for the treatment of nmDMD in Israel and South Korea in 2015 and Chile in 2018 and these licenses are currently active. We have filed for marketing authorization with ANVISA, the Brazilian regulatory authority. We expect a regulatory decision on approval in Brazil by the end of 2019. Many territories outside of the EEA, including Israel, South Korea and Chile, reference and depend on the determinations by the EMA when considering the grant of a marketing authorization. It is unlikely that we would be able to maintain our marketing authorizations in these regions in the event the EMA determines not to renew or otherwise modifies or withdraws our marketing authorization in the EEA. We have been pursuing and expect to continue to pursue marketing authorizations for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in other regions.
Emflaza for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the United States
8

Emflaza, both in tablet and suspension form, received approval from the FDA in February 2017 as a treatment for DMD in patients five years of age and older in the United States. We estimate that there are between approximately 10,000 and 15,000 DMD patients in the United States. We are obligated to complete certain post-marketing requirements in connection with the FDA's approval, including pre-clinical and clinical safety studies. In recent interactions with the FDA, we were invited to submit a supplementary NDA, or sNDA, for Emflaza for patients 2 to 5 years of age on the basis that existing data support its safety and efficacy in this population. We recently submitted the sNDA for potential approval in 2019, recently received an approval action date of July 4, 2019, and now expect to launch Emflaza in this younger population before the end of 2019.
Emflaza has a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for the approved indication, commencing on the date of FDA approval, under the provisions of the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, or the Orphan Drug Act, as well as a concurrent five-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for the active moiety in Emflaza under the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act. In 2017, the FDA had requested that we conduct a pediatric study of Emflaza, which, upon completion of an agreed-upon study, we expected to be granted a six-month term of pediatric exclusivity, added to the end of the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the seven-year orphan exclusivity period. With the invitation to submit the sNDA, discussed above, this previous request from the FDA that a trial in patients 2 to 5 years of age be performed has been officially withdrawn and the trial will no longer be conducted, and therefore we will no longer receive the six-month term of pediatric exclusivity. See “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-The new drug and biologic approval process-Hatch-Waxman Act for Drugs” below for further discussion with respect to marketing protection we rely on.
Akcea Partnership 
In August 2018 we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Akcea for the commercialization by us of TegsediTM (inotersen), WaylivraTM (volanesorsen) and products containing those compounds in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, or the PTC Territory. See “Item 1. Business-Our Collaboration and Funding Arrangements-Akcea Therapeutics” below for further discussion with respect to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Akcea. 
Tegsedi
Tegsedi, a product of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s, an affiliate of Akcea, proprietary antisense technology, is an antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, inhibitor of human transthyretin, or TTR, production. Tegsedi is the world’s first RNA-targeted therapeutic to treat patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis. It has received marketing authorization in the U.S., EU and Canada for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis. We have filed for marketing authorization with ANVISA, which granted priority review. We expect approval in Brazil by the end of 2019.
hATTR amyloidosis is a progressive, systemic and fatal inherited disease caused by the abnormal formation of the TTR protein and aggregation of TTR amyloid deposits in various tissues and organs throughout the body, including in peripheral nerves, heart, intestinal tract, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow. The progressive accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these tissues and organs leads to sensory, motor and autonomic dysfunction often having debilitating effects on multiple aspects of a patient's life. Patients with hATTR amyloidosis often present with a mixed phenotype and experience overlapping symptoms of polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy.
Ultimately, hATTR amyloidosis generally results in death within three to fifteen years of symptom onset. Therapeutic options for the treatment of patients with hATTR amyloidosis are limited and there are currently no disease-modifying drugs approved for the disease. There are an estimated 50,000 patients with hATTR amyloidosis worldwide, including approximately 6,000 patients with polyneuropathic hATTR amyloidosis in Latin America.
Waylivra
Waylivra, is under regulatory review in the EU for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS. The U.S. and EU regulatory agencies have granted orphan drug designation to Waylivra for the treatment of FCS. In August 2018, Waylivra received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA's Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Waylivra received a notice of noncompliance withdrawal letter from Health Canada. Additionally, Waylivra is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of people with familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL. The EMA has granted orphan drug designation to Waylivra for the treatment of patients with FPL.
FCS is an ultra-rare disease caused by impaired function of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, or LPL, and characterized by severe hypertriglyceridemia (>880mg/dL) and a risk of unpredictable and potentially fatal acute pancreatitis. Because of limited LPL function, people with FCS cannot break down chylomicrons, lipoprotein particles that are 90% triglycerides. In addition to pancreatitis, FCS patients are at risk of chronic complications due to permanent organ damage. They can experience daily symptoms including abdominal pain, generalized fatigue and impaired cognitions that affect their ability to work. People with FCS also report major emotional and psychosocial effects including anxiety, social withdrawal, depression and brain fog. There is no effective therapy for FCS currently available. 
Neither Tegsedi nor Waylivra is currently approved for marketing in the PTC Territory.

Product development programs
Our pipeline has a number of development programs in the clinical and pre-clinical stages. These include our splicing, gene therapy and oncology programs as well additional studies of our current commercial products to both expand marketing labels and find benefits that these treatments may have in additional indications.
Translarna™ (ataluren)
Mechanism of action
We discovered Translarna by applying our technologies to identify molecules that promote or enhance the suppression of nonsense mutations. Nonsense mutations are implicated in a variety of genetic disorders. Nonsense mutations create a premature stop signal in the translation of the genetic code contained in messenger RNA, or mRNA, and prevent the production of full-length, functional proteins. Based on our research, we believe that Translarna interacts with the ribosome, which is the component of the cell that decodes the mRNA molecule and manufactures proteins, to enable the ribosome to read through premature nonsense stop signals on mRNA and allow the cell to produce a full-length, functional protein. As a result, we believe that Translarna has the potential to be an important therapy for genetic disorders which are the result of a nonsense mutation. Genetic tests are available for many genetic disorders, including those noted above, to determine if the underlying cause is a nonsense mutation. Translarna has been generally well-tolerated in all of our clinical trials to date, which have enrolled over 1,000 individuals to date.
Planned and ongoing clinical development of Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Study 041
Overview. As a specific obligation to our marketing authorization in the EEA, we are required to conduct and submit to the EMA the results of a three-year clinical trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of Translarna in the treatment of ambulatory patients with nmDMD aged five years or older. The trial is comprised of two stages: an 18-month randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial followed by an 18-month open label extension period. We refer to the 18-month clinical trial portion as “Stage 1” and the 18-month extension period as “Stage 2”. We refer to Stage 1 and Stage 2 together as Study 041. As a condition to our marketing authorization, we are required to submit the results of Study 041 to the EMA by September 2021. Due to enrollment at a slower pace in certain countries than initially expected, in our February 2019 marketing authorization renewal request, we asked the EMA to extend the timeframe for submission of the results of Study 041 to the EMA to the end of the third quarter of 2022. The protocol for Study 041 has been approved by the CHMP.
For a discussion of the risks related to conducting clinical trials, in general, and Study 041, in particular, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates” ands “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates”.
Enrollment. According to the study protocol, Study 041 will enroll nmDMD patients aged five years and above who achieve a 6-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, equal to or greater than 150 meters at three pre-treatment evaluation times (screening, baseline day one and baseline day two), tested as set forth in the protocol. Qualified participants will also need to perform timed function tests of running/walking 10 meters, climbing/descending four stairs and standing from supine within 30 seconds at both screening and baseline, and meet the other criteria set forth in the protocol.
Of the approximately 250 patients planned to be enrolled in Study 041, approximately 160 patients are expected to meet the criteria for inclusion in the primary analysis population, which we refer to as the modified intention-to-treat population, or mITT. Patients included in the mITT must be at least 7, but less than 16, years old, with a 6MWD of equal to or greater than 300 meters and a stand from supine time of five seconds or more, each as tested at screening and baseline.
Objectives and endpoints. The primary objective of Study 041 is to evaluate the effect of Translarna on ambulation and endurance as assessed by the 6-minute walk test, or 6MWT. Based on the study protocol, the primary analysis of Stage 1 will evaluate the difference in slope of change in 6MWD from baseline to week 72 between Translarna and placebo in the mITT population. Data from participants who do not qualify for inclusion in the mITT will be used for summary and analysis of efficacy endpoints.
Slope of change in 6MWD over 144 weeks will also be assessed as a secondary endpoint at the conclusion of Stage 2, and the consistency of the results at 144 weeks against week 72 will be assessed. Changes in 6MWD from baseline to week 72 and week 144 respectively will also be assessed as secondary endpoints.
A secondary objective of Study 041 is to determine the effects of Translarna on ambulation and burst activity as assessed by timed function tests (10-meter run/walk, 4-stair stair-climb, and 4-stair stair descend). Each timed function test will be analyzed as a secondary endpoint for both the mITT and ITT populations, at the end of Stage 1 and Stage 2. A separate analysis will evaluate 10-meter run/walk results in participants with a baseline 6MWD below 300 meters. An additional analysis will evaluate a composite endpoint of average change in times to run/walk 10 meters, climb 4 stairs, and descend 4 stairs. We will also assess each of time to loss of ambulation, stair-climbing and stair-descending over 72 weeks and over 144 weeks.

Determination of the effects of Translarna on lower-limb muscle function as assessed by the North Star Ambulatory Assessment, or NSAA, a functional scale designed for boys affected by DMD, will serve as an additional secondary objective. NSAA scores will be analyzed as secondary endpoints for both the mITT and ITT populations, at the end of Stage 1 and Stage 2. A separate analysis for Stage 2 will evaluate changes in total score in participants with a baseline 6MWD of equal to or greater than 400 meters and under 7 years of age. We will also assess the risk of loss of NSAA items over 72 weeks and 144 weeks.
The safety profile of Translarna also will be evaluated throughout Stage 1 and Stage 2 as a secondary objective.
Certain exploratory endpoints will also be assessed in Study 041. In patients aged 7 years and above, change from baseline in upper limb function will be assessed using both functional testing and parent/caregiver-reported questionnaires. In patients under 7 years of age, muscle strength will be assessed by change from baseline in myometry parameters. At pre-qualified sites only, magnetic resonance imaging will be used to assess change from baseline in muscle fat fraction. The effects of Translarna on pulmonary function will be assessed by change from baseline in forced vital capacity. In addition, subject- and parent/caregiver-reported questionnaires and at-home diaries will be assessed to evaluate the effect of Translarna on health-related quality of life (HRQL) changes from baseline.
Stratification. In Stage 1, participants will be randomized 1:1 to placebo or Translarna (10, 10, 20 mg/kg). The randomization will be stratified based on type of concomitant corticosteroid used at baseline (deflazacort versus prednisone/prednisolone), maximum of the two valid 6-minute walk tests performed at baseline day 1 and day 2 (<300 meters versus ≥300 to <350 meters, versus ≥350 to <400 meters, versus ≥400 meters), and time to stand from supine at baseline (<5 seconds versus ≥5 seconds).
Study 045
Following the FDA’s recommendation to collect dystrophin data using validated quantification methods, we initiated Study 045 to evaluate the ability of ataluren to increase dystrophin protein levels in boys with nmDMD. The study, a Phase 2 open label clinical study, was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018, and will have a 40-week study period. We expect the study to be completed in the first quarter of 2020. 
Observational study, data collection, and open label, extension trials of Translarna for treatment of nmDMD
We are undertaking a multi-center, observational post-approval study of patients receiving Translarna on a commercial basis, or Study 025o, as required by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the EMA and in collaboration with TREAT-NMD and the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group. During the study we will gather data on the safety, effectiveness, and prescription patterns of Translarna in routine clinical practice. We have successfully enrolled more than 200 patients in Study 025o and we expect to follow their progress over five years.
Pursuant to the five-year managed access agreement entered into in July 2016 between us, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, National Health Services England, or NHS England, and other interested parties, the NorthStar Network is collecting data on the efficacy of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD as measured by the NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment test. Patients receiving Translarna will be compared to an historical natural history population as well as a matched control group in order to assess response to treatment over the period specified in the managed access agreement.
An open label, extension trial involving patients who participated in ACT DMD is also ongoing, across multiple sites in the United States, Europe and other territories. Two open label extension trials involving patients from the United States, Europe, Israel, Australia, and Canada who had participated in our prior trials for nmDMD are also ongoing. In certain limited territories where Translarna is available via a commercial or EAP program, we have begun to wind down the studies and are investigating the potential impact that additional site closures may have on our research and development expense.
Completed clinical trials of Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Phase 2 pediatric study
As part of our pediatric development commitments under our marketing authorization in the EEA and to support the potential expansion of the Translarna label to younger patients with nmDMD, we initiated a Phase 2 pediatric clinical study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of Translarna in patients two to five years of age. The study, initiated in June 2016, included a four-week screening period, a four-week study period, and a 48-week extension period for patients who complete the four-week study period (52 weeks total treatment). In July 2018, the EMA approved a label-extension request to our marketing authorization for Translarna in the EEA to include patients from two to up to five years of age, based on data from this study.
Phase 3 clinical trial of Translarna for nmDMD (ACT DMD)
In October 2015, we announced results from ACT DMD, also referred to as Study 020, our Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Translarna in patients with nmDMD. ACT DMD involved 228 patients at 53 sites across 18 countries.
11

In the overall intent-to-treat, or ITT, study population, the primary endpoint of change from baseline at week 48 in the 6MWT, showed a 15 meter benefit in favor of Translarna, which did not meet statistical significance.
A summary of the safety and efficacy results from ACT DMD is outlined below.
Safety and tolerability.    The results of ACT DMD confirmed the favorable safety profile of Translarna seen in our 48-week, 174-patient Phase 2b double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of Translarna in patients with nmDMD completed in 2009, or the Phase 2b trial. 
Translarna was generally well tolerated at both dose levels in our Phase 2b clinical trial. There were no study discontinuations due to adverse events. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Investigators’ attributions of drug-related adverse effects were generally similar across the placebo and Translarna arms. The most common adverse events in this trial were vomiting (46.6% overall), headache (29.3%), diarrhea (24.1%), nasopharyngitis (20.7%), fever (19.0%), cough (19.0%) and upper abdominal pain (17.8%). These events were generally balanced across treatment arms and are typical of pediatric illnesses. Adverse events with at least a 10% incidence in any treatment arm that were seen with increased frequency from the placebo group to the Translarna 40 mg dose group to the Translarna 80 mg dose group were nausea (12.3% for placebo, 14.0% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 16.7% for the Translarna 80 mg group), abdominal pain (7.0% for placebo, 12.3% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 16.7% for the Translarna 80 mg group), pain in extremity (10.5% for placebo, 12.3% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 13.3% for the Translarna 80 mg group), flatulence (7.0% for placebo, 8.8% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 11.7% for the Translarna 80 mg group) and nasal congestion (7.0% for placebo, 8.8% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 10.0% for the Translarna 80 mg group). There were no serious adverse events observed during the trial that were considered possibly or probably related to Translarna. Determination of relatedness of the serious adverse event to Translarna was made by the trial investigator, based on his or her judgment.
Translarna was generally well tolerated in ACT DMD. There were two study discontinuations due to adverse events, including one in the Translarna arm (constipation) and one in the placebo arm (disease progression). Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common adverse events in this trial were vomiting (20.4% overall), nasopharyngitis (20.0%), headache (18.3%), and fall (17.8%). These events were generally balanced across treatment arms and are typical of pediatric illnesses and/or patients with DMD. Adverse events with at least a 10% incidence in either treatment arm that were seen with increased frequency from the placebo group to the Translarna 40 mg dose group were vomiting (18.3% for placebo, 23.6% for the Translarna 40 mg group), nasopharyngitis (19.1% for placebo, 20.9% for the Translarna 40 mg group), fall (17.4% for placebo, 18.3% for the Translarna 40 mg group), cough (11.3% for placebo, 16.5% for the Translarna 40 mg group) diarrhea (8.7% for placebo, 17.4% for the Translarna 40 mg group), and pyrexia (10.4% for placebo, 13.9% for the Translarna 40 mg group). An overview of adverse events in this trial is shown in the table below.

Intent to Treat (ITT) Population.    The primary efficacy endpoint in ACT DMD was change in 6MWD from baseline to week 48. In the ITT population, a 15 meter benefit (p=0.213) was observed in the primary endpoint which did not meet statistical significance.
Secondary endpoints in the trial included the proportion of patients with at least 10% worsening in 6MWD at week 48 of the trial compared to baseline, or 10% 6MWD worsening, and change in timed function tests of time to run/walk 10 meters, climb four stairs and descend four stairs. The hazard ratio for Translarna versus placebo was 0.75 (p=0.160) for 10% 6MWD worsening. Benefits trended in favor of Translarna over placebo in the timed function tests in the ITT population, including observed results in time to run/walk 10 meters (1.2 seconds; p=0.117), time to climb four stairs (1.8 seconds; p=0.058), and time to descend four stairs (1.8 seconds; p=0.012).
Additional endpoints included the NSAA test and the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument, or PODCI, a validated tool for measuring quality of life in pediatric patients with orthopedic conditions. These additional endpoints favored Translarna in the ITT population but did not meet statistical significance.
Pre-Specified Analyses.    The statistical analysis plan submitted to the FDA for ACT DMD set forth pre-specified analyses of efficacy to be conducted, including subgroups of patients with baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters and patients with baseline 6MWD of greater than or equal to 300 and less than 400 meters, which we refer to as our key subgroups.
The pre-specification of our key subgroups was scientifically justified based upon knowledge of the biology and natural history of the disease and the evolving understanding of the of the six minute walk test as used to assess DMD patients. We considered the pre-specified less than 350 meter baseline 6MWD population as a key subgroup based on the knowledge that 350 meters represents a transition point for patients towards a more rapid decline in walking ability as supported by analysis from our Phase 2b trial. Furthermore, we considered the pre-specified 300 to 400 meter baseline 6MWD population as a key subgroup based on an increasing understanding of the sensitivity limitations of the six minute walk test as an endpoint in 48-week studies. Natural history data suggest that the 6MWT may not be the optimal tool to demonstrate efficacy in patients with either a baseline 6MWD of less than 300 meters, as these patients have significant muscle loss as monitored by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and are at high risk for losing ambulation regardless of treatment, or in high walking patients, such as those with a baseline 6MWD at or greater than 400 meters, as these patients are likely to remain stable over a 48 week testing period.
By defining these key subgroups, we thereby also defined corresponding subgroups of patients with baseline 6MWD greater than or equal to 350 meters, greater than or equal to 400 meters, and less than 300 meters. We also pre-specified a meta-analysis of the combined results from ACT DMD and the Phase 2b ambulatory decline phase patients.
Pre-specified sub-group analysis.    We saw strong evidence of clinical benefit in the pre-specified subgroup of patients with baseline 6MWD between 300 and 400 meters. Specifically, we observed a benefit in Translarna-treated patients of 47 meters (nominal p=0.007) in the 6MWT in this subgroup. This was consistent with an observed benefit of 49 meters (nominal p=0.026) in our Phase 2b clinical trial in the 300 to 400 meters baseline 6MWD population. We also saw clinically meaningful benefit for Translarna over placebo in each of the timed function tests, including observed results in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.1 seconds; nominal p=0.066), time to climb four stairs (3.6 seconds; nominal p=0.003), and time to descend four stairs (4.3 seconds; nominal p<0.001). The hazard ratio for Translarna versus placebo was 0.79 (nominal p=0.418) for 10% 6MWD worsening. In addition, a benefit of 4.5 points over placebo (nominal p=0.041) was observed in the NSAA test, which we believe is clinically meaningful. We believe that the benefits observed in this key pre-specified subgroup support the use of the 6MWT in the patients with a walking ability in the 300 to 400 meters range and the understanding that the reliability of the 6MWT over a 48 week period was limited at both the lower and upper ends of our 6MWD enrollment range.
In the pre-specified subgroup of patients with baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters, we observed a benefit of 24 meters (nominal p=0.210) in favor of Translarna in the 6MWT. An analysis of the results from our Phase 2b clinical trial in the less than 350 meters baseline 6MWD population, defined post-hoc, demonstrated a 68 meter benefit in the 6MWT (nominal p=0.006). In the timed function tests for the subgroup of ACT DMD patients with baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters, we observed benefits for Translarna over placebo in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.3 seconds; nominal p=0.033), time to climb four stairs (4.2 seconds; nominal p=0.019) and time to descend four stairs (4.0 seconds; nominal p=0.007).
Typically, a trial result is statistically significant if the chance of it occurring when the treatment is like placebo is less than one in 20, resulting in a p-value of less than 0.05. A nominal p-value is the result of one particular comparison when more than one comparison is possible, such as when two active treatments are compared to placebo or when two or more subgroups are analyzed.
As described above, we believe the 6MWT lacks sensitivity to detect a clinical effect in patients with baseline less than 300 meters in a 48-week trial. However, the timed function tests trended in favor of patients treated with Translarna with a baseline 6MWD below 300 meters, including observed benefit over placebo in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.5 seconds; nominal p=0.066), time to climb four stairs (2.4 seconds; nominal p=0.790), and time to descend four stairs (2.1 seconds; nominal p=0.595). We believe the positive trends in this population reflect that short muscle burst activity tests may be a better clinical measure for patients that are at a more advanced stage of disease progression. Consistent with the natural history of ambulatory DMD patients with 6MWD greater than 400 meters, which indicates stability in walking ability over a 48 week period, we observed no meaningful difference 
13

in 6MWT between patient groups. Similarly, we observed no meaningful difference in 6MWT between patient groups with baseline 6MWD greater than 350 meters.
Pre-specified meta-analysis.    The meta-analysis combined efficacy results from the ACT DMD ITT population and Phase 2b ambulatory decline phase subgroup. The Phase 2b ambulatory decline phase group includes the patients from our randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with nmDMD who would have met the enrollment criteria of ACT DMD.
Results from the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant 21 meter improvement in 6MWD (p = 0.015) favoring Translarna.
Additionally, the meta-analysis showed statistically significant benefit for Translarna over placebo across each timed function test including time to run/walk 10 meters (1.4 seconds; p=0.025), time to climb four stairs (1.6 seconds; p =0.018) and time to descend four stairs (2.0 seconds; p=0.004). The hazard ratio for Translarna versus placebo was 0.66 (p=0.023) for 10% 6MWD worsening. We believe that we are able to demonstrate a statistically significant outcome in the 6MWD in the meta-analysis, despite the significant variability in baseline 6MWD among patients in both ACT DMD and the Phase 2b trial’s ambulatory decline phase, due to the substantially larger patient population available in the pooled analysis.
Retrospective Analysis.    We also looked back at the observed results in the meta-analysis for all patients with a baseline 300 to 400 meter 6MWD from ACT DMD and the Phase 2b trial. The meta-analysis of these data demonstrated a 45 meter benefit (nominal p<0.001) in the 6MWT as well as clinically meaningful benefits across each secondary endpoint timed function test, including benefit over placebo in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.2 seconds; nominal p=0.008), time to climb four stairs (3.4 seconds; nominal p<0.001) and time to descend four stairs (4.3 seconds; nominal p<0.001). This meta-analysis of patients with baseline 6MWD of 300 to 400 meters was not pre-specified and is defined post-hoc.
A retrospective analysis performed after unblinding trial results can result in the introduction of bias if the analysis is inappropriately tailored or influenced by knowledge of the data and actual results. In addition, nominal p-values cannot be compared to the benchmark p-value of 0.05 to determine statistical significance without being adjusted for the testing of multiple dose groups or analyses of subgroups. Because of these limitations, regulatory authorities typically give greatest weight to results from pre-specified analyses and adjusted p-values and less weight to results from post-hoc, retrospective analyses and nominal p-values.
Statistical Considerations.    The pre-specified meta-analysis results, which favored Translarna in the 6MWT and each of the timed function tests, are considered statistically significant. In the pre-specified subgroups of ACT DMD patients with a baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters and 300 to 400 meters, the p-values for the 6MWT and each of the timed function tests are considered nominal. For information with respect to the use of nominal p-values and post-hoc analyses, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Our conclusions regarding the activity and potential efficacy of Translarna in nmDMD are primarily based on retrospective, subgroup and meta-analyses of the results of our Phase 2b and ACT DMD clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Other than with respect to certain of our meta-analyses, results of our analyses are expressed as nominal p-values, which are generally considered less reliable indicators of efficacy than adjusted p-values. In addition, retrospective analyses are generally considered less reliable than pre-specified analyses.”
Participation Criteria and Stratification.    Certain key inclusion criteria were specified in the ACT DMD trial protocol for enrollment: the patient had to be 7 through 16 years of age; at the screening visit the patient had to be able to walk no more than 80% of predicted 6MWD compared to healthy boys matched for age and height, but had to be able to walk at least 150 meters during the 6MWT; and the patient must have used systemic corticosteroids for a minimum of six months prior to start of treatment. The ACT DMD trial protocol provided for the exclusion of patients from the trial if, among other things, they recently used systemic aminoglycoside antibiotics, recently initiated or changed corticosteroid therapy or previously received Translarna treatment. Patients enrolled in ACT DMD underwent 48 weeks of blinded treatment prior to the final analysis and the randomization was stratified based on age (<9 years versus ≥9), baseline 6MWD (<350 versus ≥350 meters), and duration of prior use of corticosteroids (<12 months versus ≥12 months).
TranslarnaTM for additional indications
Over the last seven years, multiple independent investigators have conducted preclinical studies in which Translarna enabled readthrough of the premature stop codons from a large set of nonsense mutations across a diverse group of experimental models exhibiting various genetic disorders. The studies evaluated the ability of Translarna to read through premature stop codons in mRNA in cell-free systems, transfected cell lines, mouse models and patient cells. Based on these studies by independent investigators in addition to our own trials and studies, we expect to continue to pursue additional indications for Translarna, including aniridia caused by nonsense mutation and, via an investigator initiated study, Dravet syndrome/CDKL5 caused by nonsense mutation.
Nonsense mutation aniridia
Aniridia is a genetic disorder due to mutations in the PAX6 gene associated with ocular anatomical defects at birth, progressive loss of eyesight, and other symptoms. We estimate that approximately one-third of all aniridia cases are due to a nonsense mutation. 
14

In a prior study conducted by an independent investigator, Translarna-treated mice with nonsense mutation aniridia showed a significant increase in the PAX6 protein in a nonsense mutation PAX6 gene, but not in mice with a PAX6 gene harboring a splice-site mutation. The investigators in this study found that Translarna not only inhibited disease progression, but also reversed corneal, lens and retinal defects and restored electrical responses of the retina.
The first patient in our clinical study of Translarna in nonsense mutation aniridia, which we refer to as STAR, was dosed in February 2016. STAR is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of Translarna in patients with aniridia caused by a nonsense mutation, followed by an open-label extension study. Patients will receive blinded study drug for 48 weeks followed by open-label Translarna for another 96 weeks. The open label portion of the study was extended from the initially planned 48 weeks to 96 weeks as our knowledge of the disease and endpoint evolved from when the study was originally initiated. Safety and efficacy will be assessed. We have completed enrollment for our aniridia study and anticipate results during 2019.
Nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5
Dravet syndrome and CDKL5 are two different genetically defined disorders of epilepsy. Dravet syndrome, also called severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a debilitating form of epilepsy caused by mutations in the sodium voltage gated channel a1 subunit gene required for the proper function of brain cells. People with Dravet syndrome experience frequent seizures and developmental delays. CDKL5 is caused by a mutation of the Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) gene leading to a lack of the protein critical in brain development. CDKL5 is characterized by seizures starting early in life and severe developmental impairment.
A clinical study assessing Translarna in nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5 was initiated in the first quarter of 2017. The study is an investigative trial and we do not expect to use it as the basis for a regulatory submission. The study is fully enrolled and we expect it to be completed in the first quarter of 2021, at which point we will reassess the program.
Emflaza for Limb-girdle 2I
Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I, or LGMD2I, is a form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, which refers to a group of conditions that cause weakness and wasting of the muscles in the arms and legs. The proximal muscles (those closest to the body such as the upper arms and thighs) are generally most affected by the condition. In LGMD2I, specifically, signs and symptoms often develop in late childhood (average age 11.5 years) and may include difficulty running and walking. The symptoms gradually worsen over time and affected people generally rely on a wheelchair for mobility approximately 23-26 years after onset. LGMD2I is caused by changes (mutations) in the FKRP gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There is currently no cure for LGMD2I and treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.
We plan on initiating a clinical study assessing Emflaza in limb-girdle 2I in the second quarter of 2019. The study is expected to be a 52 week placebo controlled study and we anticipate results during 2020.
Splicing Platform
Spinal muscular atrophy program
Spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle wasting and weakness. The disease generally manifests early in life. SMA is caused by mutation or deletion of the Survival of Motor Neuron 1, or SMN1, gene that encodes the survival of motor neuron, or SMN, protein. The SMN protein is critical to the health and survival of the nerve cells in the spinal cord responsible for muscle contraction. A second gene, SMN2, is very similar to SMN1, except that SMN2 contains a T nucleotide at position 6 in exon 7 that results in splicing and production of reduced levels of functional SMN protein. According to the SMA Foundation, SMA is the leading genetic cause of death in infants and toddlers and that one in approximately 11,000 children is born with the disease. We estimate that SMA affects approximately 20,000 to 30,000 children and adults in the United States, Europe and Japan.
Using our splicing technology and in collaboration with the SMA Foundation, we identified highly potent small molecule splicing modifiers that, in non-clinical studies in cultured cells derived from patients with SMA, increased both the inclusion of exon 7 in the SMN2 mRNA and the levels of SMN protein produced by SMN2. Importantly, in studies in transgenic mice carrying only the SMN2 gene, these orally bioavailable compounds, penetrated the blood-brain barrier and increased the levels of full-length SMN2 mRNA and protein in brain, spinal cord, muscle and other tissues. In these same mouse studies, treatment with these compounds resulted in increased survival, restoration of body weight, prevention of motor neuron loss and improved motor function.
In November 2011, we entered into a collaboration and licensing agreement with Roche which included a $30 million upfront payment, the potential for up to $460 million in milestone payments and royalties on net sales. Roche is responsible for pursuing clinical development of compounds from the research program under the collaboration and then commercializing any resulting products. We have received $47.5 million in milestone payments from Roche, including a $20 million milestone payment upon the transition into the pivotal second part of the Sunfish study for risdiplam. We also previously received $13.3 million in sponsored research funding for this program from the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation.
15

One of the compounds in the SMA collaboration that is currently being advanced in development is risdiplam. In October 2016, a two-part clinical study, called Sunfish, initiated in pediatric and adult type 2 and type 3 SMA patients to investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of risdiplam. Both parts of Sunfish are double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and randomized. Part one of the study was a dose-finding study in 51 type 2 and type 3 SMA patients randomized 2:1 risdiplam vs. placebo and treated for 12 weeks with the primary objective of evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in patients. Data from the open label extension of part 1 of the Sunfish trial were presented in October 2018 at the 23rd International Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society, or the World Muscle conference. Risdiplam was well-tolerated at all doses and there have been no drug-related safety findings leading to withdrawal. In Sunfish, the data demonstrated that the previously reported median greater-than-2-fold SMN protein level increase was maintained over 52 weeks of treatment indicating the durability of the pharmacodynamic effect.
Based on the results from part one of Sunfish, dosing for the second part of the study was selected and the pivotal part two of Sunfish initiated in October 2017, which triggered a $20 million milestone payment to us from Roche. Part two of Sunfish completed recruitment in October 2018 with 180 type 2 and type 3 SMA patients enrolled. The patients are randomized 2:1 risdiplam vs. placebo for 12 months followed by 12 months of all study participants receiving risdiplam. Patients enrolled in part 2 of Sunfish have a broad age range (2-24 years; median age 8 years) and broad functional characteristics. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in the total Motor Function Measure 32, or MFM-32, score at Month 12. Both part one and part two of the study will be followed by an open-label extension.
In December 2016, a two-part clinical study, called Firefish, also initiated in infants with type 1 SMA to investigate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of risdiplam. Both parts of Firefish are open-label studies. Part one of Firefish was a dose-finding study in 21 infants. The primary objective of part one was to assess the safety profile of risdiplam in infants and determine the dose for part two. Interim clinical data from the Firefish part 1 trial were also presented in October 2018 at the World Muscle conference. The median age of first dose was 6.7 months and babies have received risdiplam for a duration of up to 20.3 months. Risdiplam has been well tolerated at all doses and there have been no drug-related safety findings leading to withdrawal. At day 245 of treatment, over 90% of the babies achieved a greater than 4-point increase in CHOP-INTEND score compared to baseline, a rating to evaluate the motor skills of patients with type 1 SMA developed by the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The CHOP-INTEND data were further supported by video footage presented by a principal investigator in the trial, who showed a video of an additional type 1 SMA baby sitting unassisted, bringing the total to 4 babies sitting unassisted as shown in patient videos. Natural history indicates that type 1 SMA babies never achieve this milestone. The video also showed type 1 SMA babies from the Firefish trial demonstrating head control and rolling. Moreover, no babies have required a tracheostomy or permanent ventilation since study initiation and no baby has lost the ability to swallow. Previously published natural history data indicate that in comparable historic cohorts the median age of event-free survival for type 1 SMA infants is between 8 and 10.5 months. In addition, SMN protein level increases of up to 6.5-fold were observed after 28 days of dosing and the increase was sustained.
Based on the results from part one of Firefish, part two of Firefish was initiated in March 2018 and completed recruitment in November 2018 with 41 type 1 SMA infants enrolled. The primary objective of part two is to assess the efficacy of risdiplam measured as the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed in the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler development - Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds). 
Based on recent feedback from the FDA and national health authorities in Europe that Part 1 of FIREFISH and SUNFISH may be sufficient to file NDA and an MAA, Roche is preparing an NDA and a MAA for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA in the United States and the EU, respectively, which Roche anticipates submitting to the FDA and the EMA in the second half of 2019.
Jewelfish, an open-label study investigating the safety, tolerability, PK, and PK/pharmacodynamic relationship of risdiplam in type 2 and type 3 SMA patients who have been previously treated with one of several experimental SMA therapies, initiated in the first quarter of 2017. Preliminary PD data from twelve Jewelfish patients presented in October 2018 at the World Muscle conference demonstrated sustained >2-fold increase in median SMN protein levels versus baseline over 12 months of treatment. Also, risdiplam was well tolerated, without drug- related adverse events leading to withdrawal from the study. 
Familial dysautonomia
Familial dysautonomia, or FD, is a rare genetic neurological disorder that effects the sensory and autonomic nervous systems, causing life-threatening medical complications from birth. It is caused by a splicing-altering mutation in the IKBKAP (ELP1) gene resulting in low levels of IKAP protein. FD occurs primarily in people of Ashkenazi (central or eastern European) Jewish descent, affecting about 1 in 3,700 individuals in Ashkenazi Jewish populations. It is extremely rare in the general population. There are currently no available therapies for FD, only supportive treatments.
Using our splicing technology and in collaboration with the with Massachusetts General Hospital, or MGH, and New York University, we identified the splicing compound PTC258 which is a splicing modifier that restores IKAP levels. We expect to finalize IND-enabling studies and submit an IND for PTC258 in late 2019.

Oncology program 
We have two oncology agents in Phase 1 clinical development, PTC299 and PTC596. PTC299 is a small molecule dihydrooratate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor that inhibits de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial in patients diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, who have relapsed or are refractory to current treatment options and have no other approved treatment options. We expect to fully enroll this trial by the end of 2019. In addition to assessing PTC299 as a monotherapy in our Phase 1 study, we are also assessing PTC299 in a variety of therapeutic combinations preclinically. 
AML is a rapidly progressing hematologic cancer that causes uncontrolled growth of immature blast cells in the bone marrow preventing formation of normal blood cells. It may arise as a primary cancer or result from patient exposure to prior cytotoxic and/or radiation therapy. Approximately 20,000 new patients are diagnosed annually in the United States. 
PTC596 is a small molecule inhibitor of tubulin polymerization that is associated with cell cycle arrest.  In addition, administration is associated with a hyperphosphorylation of tumor BMI1 protein that subsequently leads to BMI1 protein degradation and reduction in BMI1 protein function. We have assessed PTC596 in a Phase 1 trial as a monotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer and we are in the process of reformulating PTC596 as a tablet to decrease pill burden and minimize exposure to excipients. PTC596 is now being assessed in clinical trials in combination with standards of care in pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG, in combination with radiation as first-line therapy, with PTC596 continuing as monotherapy after radiation is completed. DIPG is a rapidly fatal pediatric cancer with 90% of patients dying within two years of diagnosis. There are approximately 300 patients diagnosed annually in the United States and Canada. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial in DIPG patients and expect to fully enroll this trial by the end of 2019. 
PTC596 is also being evaluated in leiomyosarcoma, or LMS, in patients who have relapsed or are refractory to current treatments. LMS is a type of sarcoma that manifests as malignant soft tissue tumors of muscle tissue. Preclinical evaluations suggested that PTC596 had synergistic effects in combination with dacarbazine. Of about 3,000 sarcoma patients diagnosed annually in the U.S., approximately 20% have LMS. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 dose escalation study of PTC596 for LMS in the first quarter of 2019. 
We received grant funding of $5.4 million for our oncology program from the Wellcome Trust. To the extent that we develop and commercialize program intellectual property on a for-profit basis ourselves or in collaboration with a partner (provided we retain overall control of worldwide commercialization), we may become obligated to pay to Wellcome Trust development and regulatory milestone payments. Our first such milestone payment of $0.8 million to Wellcome Trust occurred in the second quarter of 2016. For additional information, see “Item 1. Business - Our Collaborations and Funding Arrangements”.
Pre-clinical and other programs
We continue to invest in our pre-clinical product pipeline by committing significant resources to research and development programs and business development opportunities within our areas of scientific expertise, including potential collaborations, alliances, and acquisitions or licensing of assets that complement our strategic mission to provide access to best-in-class treatments for patients who have an unmet medical need. 
Our Approach
Our approach to drug discovery and development is to target rare diseases with high-unmet needs using a variety of tools, including RNA and DNA approaches. 
Splicing
Post-transcriptional control processes are the events that occur in a cell following the transcription of DNA into RNA. These processes regulate, for example, how long RNA molecules last in the cell, how precursor messenger RNA, or pre-mRNA, molecules are spliced, and how efficiently mRNA molecules are translated to produce a protein. In the majority of human protein-encoding genes, the sequence representing the mature mRNA transcript is not contiguous but rather has an interrupted structure consisting of nucleotide sequences, called introns, that are removed from the final mRNA product and nucleotide sequences, called exons, that are retained in the mature mRNA. The process of intron removal and exon joining is called splicing.
We use our splicing technology to identify molecules that modulate splicing of the pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA splicing is a multi-step biochemical reaction. Approximately 94% of all human genes encode pre-mRNAs that undergo splicing. In addition, through splicing, one gene can often generate several mRNA products by including or excluding exons that can result in the mRNA being regulated differently or translated into different proteins. Altered regulation of splicing is the direct cause of many human diseases, including many forms of cancer, SMA, Riley-Day syndrome (familial dysautonomia) and myotonic dystrophy.
We have developed a powerful high-throughput drug discovery technology that enables us to identify small molecule modifiers of pre-mRNA splicing. The technology relies on a sensitive quantification of mRNA directly in human cells or tissue samples. 
17

Using this technology, we have successfully identified orally bioavailable small molecules that correct splicing of the Survival of Motor Neuron 2, or SMN2, mRNA, which is implicated in the genetic disorder SMA. Based on this experience, we believe that other small molecule drug candidates can be rapidly identified that correct splicing of pre-mRNA, promote inclusion of specific exons into mRNA or force skipping of undesired exons from the mature mRNA. We believe that this technology is potentially widely applicable to a large number of target genes in all therapeutic areas.
Nonsense suppression
An mRNA contains multiple regions that have specific functions. Although the protein coding region of mRNA contains the information for the amino acid sequence of the protein product, several regions of mRNA do not code for the protein and are known as untranslated regions, or UTRs. They are unique to specific mRNAs or groups of mRNAs and are directly involved in the post-transcriptional control of protein production. Interactions of cellular factors with the UTRs on the mRNA determine when and how much protein is produced as well as how mRNA is degraded and eliminated from the cell.
We use our nonsense suppression technology to identify molecules that promote or enhance readthrough of premature stop codons in the mRNA. The presence of a premature stop codon results in translation termination before a full-length protein can be produced. Our nonsense suppression technologies identify small molecules that increase readthrough at the premature stop codon by facilitating the incorporation of a defined set of amino acids at the site of the premature stop codon resulting in the production a full-length protein. We anticipate that this approach will be applicable to a wide variety of therapeutic areas.
In addition to identifying molecules that increase readthrough, we are identifying molecules that can enhance the nonsense suppression effect of Translarna and other readthrough agents by preventing the decay of nonsense-mutation containing mRNAs, a process known as nonsense mediated decay. We have developed a high throughput screen to identify molecules that increase the level of and stabilize premature stop codon-containing mRNAs. We can evaluate the effect of these molecules alone and in combination with Translarna in cell-based models of disease, identify lead compounds and initiate a chemical optimization program. We are currently in the process of evaluating compounds as single agents and in combination with readthrough compounds in preparation for an optimization program.
Gene therapy
Gene therapy is a technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease through several approaches including 1) replacing a mutated gene that causes disease with a healthy copy of the gene, 2) inactivating, or “knocking out,” a mutated gene that is functioning improperly or 3) introducing a new gene into the body to help fight a disease. Utilizing our CNS delivery strategy and technologies, we are focused on developing gene therapy product candidates that are engineered and optimized to provide durable treatments, and potentially functional cures, for CNS diseases for which there are currently no approved treatments. By directly administering low doses our therapies using non-pathogenic AAV to deliver therapeutic genes to the target non-dividing neuronal cells in the CNS, which we term targeted micro-dosing, we believe we maximize the probability of achieving a therapeutic benefit and mitigate systemic antibody, cellular immunity and complement-based reactions, minimize the stimulation of new immune responses, and eliminate off-target effects.
We believe that our gene therapy platform will enable us to treat patients across a range of CNS disease indications. Our detailed knowledge and expertise in rare CNS diseases has developed competitive advantages and a gene therapy platform which we believe is highly differentiated and provides practical approaches for delivery of gene therapies to the CNS in a range of disease indications. Our platform utilizes commercially-available advanced devices, instrumentation and software to optimize targeting to the region of the CNS known to be involved in the cause of the disease. Targeted micro-dosing ensures direct delivery to the CNS, thereby avoiding systemic administration, mitigating systemic immune and complement responses, minimizing the generation of newly mounted immunity to the gene therapy, and bypassing uptake and excretion of the gene therapy vector by organs such as the liver and kidney which further enhances safety and keeps the dose levels low. Our targeted micro-dosing strategy has the added benefit of requiring significantly lower gene therapy doses than systemic dosing would require. Our low dose requirements provide for efficient manufacturing approaches that reduce supply risks, enhance product quality, and lower production costs. Our direct delivery processes have also resulted in a deep understanding of routes of administration that result in effective gene therapy delivery to target cells. 
Our Collaborations, License Agreements and Funding Arrangements
We currently have ongoing collaborations with Roche and the SMA Foundation for SMA, collaboration and license agreements with National Taiwan University, or NTU, for PTC-AADC, and a collaboration and license agreement with Akcea for Tegsedi and Waylivra. We also have received grant funding from Wellcome Trust pursuant to funding agreements under which we have continuing obligations. In addition to these collaboration, license and funding agreements, which are described in more detail below, during 2015 we announced our research collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital, or MGH, a Partners Healthcare hospital, for the treatment of rare genetic disorders resulting from pre-mRNA splicing defects pursuant to which we have certain licensing, development and commercialization obligations to MGH.
Roche and the SMA Foundation
18

Overview.    In November 2011, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Roche and the SMA Foundation to further develop and commercialize compounds identified under our SMA sponsored research program with the SMA Foundation and to research other small molecule compounds with potential for therapeutic use in patients with SMA. The research term of this agreement was terminated effective December 31, 2014. The ongoing collaboration is governed by a joint steering committee consisting of an equal number of representatives of us, the SMA Foundation and Roche. We, the SMA Foundation and Roche have agreed to endeavor to make decisions by consensus, but if the joint steering committee cannot reach agreement after following a specified decision resolution procedure, Roche’s decision will control. However, Roche may not exercise its final decision-making authority with respect to certain specified matters, including any decision that would increase our or the SMA Foundation’s obligations, reduce our or the SMA Foundation’s rights, expand Roche’s rights, or reduce Roche’s obligations under the license and collaboration agreement.
Commercialization.    We have granted Roche worldwide exclusive licenses, with the right to grant sublicenses, to our patent rights and know-how with respect to such compounds and products. Roche is responsible for pursuing worldwide clinical development of compounds from the research program and has the exclusive right to develop and commercialize compounds from the collaboration.
Payments and Contingent Payments.    Pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement, Roche paid us an upfront non-refundable payment of $30.0 million. During the research term, which was terminated effective December 31, 2014, Roche provided us with funding, based on an agreed- upon full-time equivalent rate, for an agreed-upon number of full- time equivalent employees that we contributed to the research program. We are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $135 million in payments if specified development and regulatory milestones are achieved and up to an aggregate of $325 million in payments if specified sales milestones are achieved. As of December 31, 2018, we have earned $47.5 million of these development and regulatory milestone payments based on the progression of the collaboration from the pre-clinical stage to Phase 2 clinical study in SMA patients. We are also entitled to tiered royalties ranging from 8% to 16% on worldwide net product sales of products developed pursuant to the collaboration. Roche’s obligation to pay us royalties will expire generally on a country-by- country basis at the latest of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering a product in the given country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for that product in such country or 10 years from the first commercial sale of that product in such country. However, the royalties payable to us may be decreased in certain circumstances. For example, the royalty rate in a particular country is reduced if the product is not protected by patents in that country and no longer entitled to regulatory exclusivity in that country. We remain responsible for making any payments to the SMA Foundation that may become due under our pre-existing sponsored research agreement with the SMA Foundation.
Termination.    Unless terminated earlier, the license and collaboration agreement will expire on the date when no royalty or other payment obligations are or will become due under the agreement. Roche’s termination rights under the license and collaboration agreement include the right to terminate the agreement at any time after November 22, 2013 on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon three months’ notice before the launch of the applicable product or upon nine months’ notice thereafter; and the right to terminate the agreement in specified circumstances following a change of control of us. The license and collaboration agreement provides that we or Roche may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured breach by the other party of a material provision of the agreement, or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon termination of the collaboration agreement by Roche for convenience or termination by us as a result of Roche’s breach, bankruptcy, change of control or patent challenge, we have the right to assume the development and commercialization of product candidates arising from the license and collaboration agreement. In that event, we may become obligated to pay royalties to Roche on sales of any such product.
SMA Foundation
Overview.    In June 2006, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with the SMA Foundation under which we and the SMA Foundation have collaborated in the research and preclinical development of small molecule therapeutics for SMA. As discussed above, we are also collaborating with the SMA Foundation and Roche to further develop these compounds. Pursuant to the sponsored research agreement, as amended, the SMA Foundation provided us with $13.3 million in funding. The SMA Foundation is not obligated to provide any further funding under this agreement.
Continuing financial obligations.    We may become obligated to pay the SMA Foundation single-digit royalties on worldwide net product sales of any collaboration product that we successfully develop and subsequently commercialize or, if we outlicense rights to a collaboration product, a specified percentage of certain payments we receive from our licensee. As discussed above, we have outlicensed rights to Roche pursuant to a license and collaboration agreement. We are not obligated to make such payments unless and until annual sales of a collaboration product exceed a designated threshold. Our obligation to make such payments would end upon our payment to the SMA Foundation of a specified amount, which we refer to as the repayment amount.
Reversion rights.    In specified circumstances, including those involving our decision to discontinue development or commercialization of a collaboration product, our uncured failure to meet agreed timelines or those that might arise following our change of control, we may be obligated to grant the SMA Foundation exclusive or non-exclusive sublicensable rights under our intellectual property, in certain collaboration products, among other rights, to assume the development and commercialization of 
19

such collaboration products and to provide the SMA Foundation with other transitional assistance, which we refer to as a reversion. In some such cases, we may be entitled to receive licensing fee payments from the SMA Foundation and single-digit royalties on sales of the applicable collaboration product, which amounts we collectively refer to as reversion payments. In other cases, the SMA Foundation is not required to make any payments to us in connection with the licenses it receives from us.
Termination.    Unless terminated earlier, the sponsored research agreement will continue until the earliest of the SMA Foundation’s receipt of the repayment amount or, if there was a reversion, either our receipt of all reversion payments that the SMA Foundation may be obligated to make to us or, if the SMA Foundation is not obligated to make reversion payments, the expiration of the last-to-expire patent we licensed to the SMA Foundation in connection with such reversion. The sponsored research agreement provides that either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency.
National Taiwan University
We have two agreements with NTU relating to PTC-AADC: a collaborative research agreement, originally entered into between Agilis and NTU, in September 2015, as amended, or the NTU Collaboration Agreement; and a license and technology transfer agreement, originally entered into between Agilis, NTU and Professor Wuh-Liang (Paul) Hwu, in December 2015, or the NTU Licensing Agreement.
NTU Collaboration Agreement
Overview. The NTU Collaboration Agreement governs the collaboration between us and NTU with respect to the research and clinical trials for AADC deficiency gene therapy, or the “Research.” Pursuant to the NTU Collaboration Agreement, NTU is responsible for performing the research and clinical trials and we are responsible for providing related funding. In accordance with such obligations, NTU completed a Phase 1/2 trial, AADC-010, in Taiwan of GT-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency and is conducting an ongoing Phase 2b trial, AADC-011, in Taiwan of PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency and is collaborating on certain other ongoing activities with third parties. We are responsible for any regulatory submissions for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency.
Funding obligations. Our funding obligations consist of funding payments for NTU’s research paid upon the achievement of certain milestones. As of December 31, 2018, an aggregate amount of $617,045 in funding payments has been paid to NTU and an additional $197,266 is expected to become due and payable between now and December 31, 2020. 
Intellectual property. All intellectual property developed or obtained by NTU relating to the Research shall be owned by NTU. The NTU Collaboration Agreement provided us a right of first refusal for an exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing license for the results of the Research, which Agilis exercised in 2015 in connection with entering into the Licensing Agreement.
Termination. The NTU Collaboration Agreement expires on September 30, 2020, with automatic annual extensions subject to our written approval. The NTU Collaboration Agreement can be terminated for certain specified breaches by either party upon 30 or 60 days’ notice, depending on the breach and following a specified cure period. Upon termination at our election, NTU is obligated to return to us any unused funding payments made to NTU that have not yet been utilized, and we are obligated to pay any non-cancellable expenses incurred by NTU, as of the date of termination.
NTU Licensing Agreement
Overview. Pursuant to the NTU Licensing Agreement, NTU granted to us an exclusive, perpetual license, with the right to grant sublicenses through all tiers, to research and use the intellectual property, data, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, records, documents, confidential information, materials and know-how pertaining to the Research, including PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, under the NTU Collaboration Agreement, or the Technology, and to develop, make, manufacture, use, sell, import and market the Technology and any other products made, invented, developed or incorporated by or with the Technology, or the Licensed Products. Subject to any regulatory delays or issues, we are obligated to research, use and develop the Technology to manufacture Licensed Products by December 23, 2025. Additionally, we are obligated to obtain marketing approval of PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, either by the FDA or by the EMA, by December 31, 2024. 
Funding Obligations. NTU received a lump sum of $100,000 upon execution of the NTU Licensing Agreement. Additionally, NTU will be entitled to receive contingent payments from us based on (i) the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones up to an aggregate maximum amount of $2.0 million, (ii) annual license maintenance fees, (iii) a low double-digit percentage royalty of annual net sales of Licensed Products, and (iv) a percentage of sublicense revenue, ranging from low-twenties to mid-twenties. The annual license maintenance fees are non-refundable, but creditable against annual net sales payments. The NTU Licensing Agreement also stipulates milestones in relation to a Phase 3 trial with respect to PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, which such Phase 3 trial we do not deem necessary and do not plan to conduct.
Intellectual Property. All intellectual property relating to the manufacture, production, assembly, use or sale of Technology and any Licensed Products derived thereof are owned by NTU.
20

Termination. The NTU Licensing Agreement expires on December 23, 2035. Upon expiration, we will have a fully paid-up, perpetual, royalty-free exclusive license to the Technology. We may terminate the NTU Licensing Agreement upon 60 days’ written notice to NTU in the event of (a) the failure of a pivotal clinical study, or serious adverse event in a clinical study, with respect to PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, that prevents continuing such clinical study under reasonable circumstances or (b) the rejection of a BLA with the FDA or a MAA with the EMA, or equivalent biologics approval application in another territory with respect to PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC. In such termination event, we must pay $100,000 to NTU within 30 days of termination and NTU would retain all rights to the Technology. We may terminate the NTU Licensing Agreement for material breach by another party following a 30-day cure period. NTU may terminate the NTU Licensing Agreement for our failure to pay any undisputed license fees or net sales or sublicensing royalty fees within the applicable deadline following a 30-day cure period.
Akcea
Overview. In August 2018, PTC Therapeutics International Limited, our subsidiary, entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Akcea Agreement, with Akcea, for the commercialization by us of Tegsedi, Waylivra and products containing those compounds, which we refer to collectively as the Products, in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, or the PTC Territory. In addition, Akcea has granted to us a right of first negotiation, or ROFN, to commercialize AKCEA-TTR-Lrx, a follow-on product candidate to inotersen, on an exclusive basis in the PTC Territory. We are responsible for all meetings, communications and other interactions with regulatory authorities in the PTC Territory. The activities of the parties pursuant to the Akcea Agreement is overseen by a Joint Steering Committee, composed of an equal number of representatives appointed by each of us and Akcea.
Commercialization. Under the terms of the Akcea Agreement, Akcea has granted to us an exclusive right and license, with the right to grant certain sublicenses, under Akcea’s product-specific intellectual property to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Products in the PTC Territory. In addition, Akcea has granted to us a non-exclusive right and license, with the right to grant certain sublicenses, under Akcea’s core intellectual property and manufacturing intellectual property to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Products in the PTC Territory and to manufacture the Products worldwide in accordance with a supply agreement with Akcea. Akcea has in-licensed certain of the Akcea intellectual property from its affiliate, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis. Each party has agreed not to, independently or with any third party, commercialize any competing oligonucleotide product in the PTC Territory for the same gene target as inotersen. 
Payments and Contingent Payments. We agreed to pay to Akcea an upfront licensing fee of $18.0 million, consisting of an initial payment of $12.0 million paid in connection with entering into the Akcea Agreement, and $6.0 million to be paid within 30 days after receipt of regulatory approval of Waylivra from the FDA or the EMA, whichever occurs earlier. In addition, Akcea is eligible to receive milestone payments, on a Product-by-Product basis, of $4.0 million upon receipt of regulatory approval for a Product from ANVISA, subject to a maximum aggregate amount of $8.0 million for all such Products. Akcea is also entitled to receive royalty payments in the mid-twenty percent range of net sales on a country-by-country and Product-by-Product basis, commencing on the earlier to occur of (1) 12 months after the first commercial sale of such Product in Brazil or (2) the date when we, our affiliates or sublicensees have recognized revenue of $10.0 million or more in cumulative net sales for such Product in the PTC Territory. The royalty payments are subject to reduction in certain circumstances as set forth in the Akcea Agreement.
Right of first negotiation. Akcea has granted to us a ROFN to commercialize AKCEA-TTR-Lrx in the PTC Territory, subject to negotiation of the terms of a definitive agreement and certain other terms and conditions. Such a definitive agreement would provide for a royalty rate to be paid by us for AKCEA-TTR-Lrx equal to the royalty rate we have agreed to pay for Tegsedi under the Akcea Agreement, or in the mid-twenty percent range of net sales, and the term of such royalty payments would be the same as the term of the Tegsedi royalty payments. During a specified period in the Agreement, neither Akcea nor Ionis may enter into an agreement or grant any license to AKCEA-TTR-Lrx that is inconsistent with PTC’s ROFN.
Termination. The Akcea Agreement will continue until the expiration of the last to expire royalty term with respect to all Products in all countries in the PTC Territory. Either party may terminate the Akcea Agreement on written notice to the other party if such other party is in material breach of its obligations thereunder and has not cured such breach within 30 days after notice in the case of a payment breach or 60 days after notice in the case of any other breach.
Wellcome Trust
We have two separate funding agreements with Wellcome Trust for the research and development of small molecule compounds in connection with our oncology and antibacterial programs. Pursuant to the agreement relating to the antibacterial program, Wellcome Trust awarded us a $5.0 million grant of which we received $4.8 million between 2011 and 2015. We are no longer actively pursuing an antibacterial program and do not expect to receive additional funding under this agreement. The materials terms of these funding agreements are similar in substance, except as described below.
The other agreement, entered into in May 2010, relates to the research and development of small molecule compounds, which we refer to as our oncology program. Pursuant to this agreement, Wellcome Trust awarded us a $5.4 million grant, of which 
21

approximately $0.9 million was paid in connection with execution of the agreement and the balance of which was paid to us in 2010 and 2012 based on our achievement of specified milestones.
Development and commercialization.    We own all intellectual property that arises from the conduct of the research programs under these funding agreements, which we refer to as program intellectual property, and are responsible for developing and commercializing the program intellectual property, including PTC596 (for our oncology program), and other compounds. However, we will require Wellcome Trust’s written consent prior to any such development or commercialization. If Wellcome Trust withholds such consent and we and Wellcome Trust are not able to resolve Wellcome Trust’s concerns, the parties have agreed to follow a specified dispute resolution procedure that gives neither party final decision-making authority.
Reversion rights.    Under both funding agreements, if we fail to take reasonable steps to develop or commercialize program intellectual property during specified timeframes, we may be obligated to grant exclusive rights to Wellcome Trust or its nominee under the program intellectual property, along with non-exclusive rights under our background intellectual property, so that Wellcome Trust or its nominee can assume such development and commercialization. If we grant such a license, we would be entitled to a share of any consideration received by Wellcome Trust in connection with any subsequent development or commercialization of program intellectual property on a for-profit basis, which share would be proportionate to our contribution to the development and commercialization.
Continuing financial obligations-oncology program.    To the extent that we develop and commercialize program intellectual property on a for-profit basis ourselves or in collaboration with a partner (provided we retain overall control of worldwide commercialization), we may become obligated to pay to Wellcome Trust development and regulatory milestone payments and single-digit royalties on sales of any research program product under our oncology program. We made the first development milestone payment of $0.8 million to Wellcome Trust under this agreement during the second quarter of 2016. Additional development and regulatory milestone payments up to an aggregate of $22.4 million may become payable by us under the agreement. For example, in the event a Phase 2 clinical study of a research program candidate, such as PTC596, is commenced, a milestone payment of $2.5 million would become payable by us to Wellcome Trust upon the earlier to occur of the first dose administered to the last patient enrolled in the study or the termination of dosing of all patients in the study.
Additional continuing financial obligations.    Our obligation to pay the royalties describe above would continue on a country-by-country basis until the longer of the expiration of the last patent in the program intellectual property in such country covering the research program product and the expiration of market exclusivity of such product in such country. To the extent that we develop and commercialize program intellectual property on a for-profit basis through outlicensing, we will be obligated to pay to Wellcome Trust a specified share of any consideration we receive from our licensee, provided that Wellcome Trust would be entitled to receive a minimum amount equal to its original contribution. We would incur no payment obligations to Wellcome Trust to the extent that we elect to develop and commercialize program intellectual property on a non-profit basis.
Termination.    Unless terminated earlier, each funding agreement will continue until we have received the full amount of the grant, the research program has ended, the last-to-expire of the patents in the program intellectual property has expired, any agreement entered into for the exploitation of the program intellectual property or our background intellectual property has expired, and there are no remaining payment obligations relating to the exploitation of the program intellectual property or our background intellectual property. Each funding agreement provides that either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency and that Wellcome Trust may terminate the agreement under specified circumstances, including, among others, in specified circumstances following a change in control of us or if Wellcome Trust believes that an uncorrected serious failure exists in the progress, management or conduct of the research program or that an act or omission by us is incompatible with or has an adverse effect on Wellcome Trust’s charitable objectives or reputation.
If Wellcome Trust terminates either or both funding agreements in specified circumstances, including as a result of our material breach, bankruptcy or insolvency, or following our change of control, we may be obligated to assign to Wellcome Trust ownership of the applicable program intellectual property, grant to Wellcome Trust royalty-free non-exclusive rights under the applicable background intellectual property for the continuation of the research program (if applicable) and the development and commercialization of the applicable program intellectual property, and provide Wellcome Trust with other specified transitional assistance.
Certain specified rights and obligations of the parties will generally survive termination of the funding agreements, including Wellcome Trust’s right to receive payments from us with respect to development and commercialization of program intellectual property on a for-profit basis.
If a funding agreement terminates prior to the end of a research program, we are obligated to return all funding we received from Wellcome Trust that is unspent at the date of termination (after deduction of costs and non-cancellable commitments incurred prior to such date).
Intellectual Property

Patents and trade secrets
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
As of January 31, 2019, our patent portfolio included a total of 74 active U.S. patents and 13 pending U.S. patent applications, including original filings, continuations and divisional applications, as well as numerous foreign counterparts to many of these patents and patent applications. We own or exclusively in-license these patents and patent applications with claims directed to composition of matter, pharmaceutical formulation and methods of use of many of our compounds, including ataluren, the active ingredient in the formulated product TranslarnaTM.
The patent rights relating to TranslarnaTM (ataluren) owned by us consist of 35 issued U.S. patents relating to composition of matter, methods of use, formulation, dosing regimens and methods of manufacture and multiple pending U.S. patent applications relating to composition of matter, methods of use, formulation, and dosing regimens. We do not license any material patent rights relating to ataluren to unaffiliated parties. The issued U.S. patents relating to composition of matter are currently scheduled to expire in 2024 and all U.S. patents that issue from U.S. patent applications arising from the composition of matter would also be scheduled to expire in 2024. Issued U.S. patents relating to therapeutic methods of use are currently scheduled to expire in 2026 and 2027, including patent term adjustment. We have patent rights that are the subject of granted patents or pending counterpart patent applications in a number of other jurisdictions, including Canada, certain South American countries, Europe, certain Middle Eastern countries, certain Africa countries, certain Asian countries and certain Eurasian countries. We own nine European patents relating to composition of matter, uses, dosing regimens and methods of manufacture of ataluren, as well as multiple pending European patent applications relating to composition of matter, uses and formulations. The expiration dates of the granted European patents occur for composition of matter in 2024, for dosing regimen patents in 2026 and 2027, and for the manufacturing process in 2027. Except as indicated above, the anticipated expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension, patent term adjustment or other marketing exclusivities that may be available to us.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved pursuant to a pre-market approval, or PMA, may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time from NDA submission that the drug is under regulatory review until the approval date while the patent is in force. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension based on Hatch-Waxman cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension and only those claims reading on the approved drug may be extended.
Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. One means of patent term extension in Europe after EMA approval is based on obtaining a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). We have applied for SPCs for ataluren in all applicable European countries in which we have a European patent and expect that all will be granted. The maximum patent term extension provided by an SPC is a total of 5 years from the date of patent term expiration. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or other non-European foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors.
We presently have no patent rights to protect the approved use of Emflaza, and we rely on non-patent market exclusivity periods under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, or the Orphan Drug Act, and the Drug Price Competition and the Hatch-Waxman Act to commercialize Emflaza in the United States. See “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-The new drug and biologic approval process-Hatch-Waxman Act for Drugs” for further information regarding the exclusivity periods that we rely on.
We are pursuing patent protection for PTC-AADC and our other gene therapy product candidates, and, in the meantime, if PTC-AADC is approved, we expect to rely on the non-patent market exclusivity periods under the Orphan Drug Act Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, to commercialize PTC-AADC in the United States. See “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-BPCIA exclusivity” for further information regarding the exclusivity periods that we rely on.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, 
23

scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
License agreements
We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property from third parties. We enter into these agreements to augment our proprietary intellectual property portfolio. The licensed intellectual property covers some of the compounds that we are researching and developing, some post-transcriptional control targets and some of the scientific processes that we use. These licenses impose various diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future.
We exclusively in-license all of the patents and patent applications, with claims directed to composition of matter, formulation and methods of use, for our gene therapy programs, including for the target disease AADC. For a further discussion of the material agreements relating to our in-licensing of PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, see “Item 1. Business-Our Collaboration, Licensing and Funding Arrangements-National Taiwan University.”
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of Translarna, Emflaza or for our other product candidates or compounds that we are testing in our preclinical programs. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of clinical and commercial supplies of Translarna, Emflaza as well as any other product or product candidate that we may develop, other than small amounts of compounds that we may synthesize ourselves for preclinical testing. We anticipate taking steps to increase our manufacturing capabilities for our gene therapy platform.
The active pharmaceutical ingredients in Translarna, Emflaza and our product candidates are provided by third-parties. We currently rely on a single source for the production of some of our raw materials and we obtain our supply of the drug substance for Translarna from two third-party manufacturers and the drug substance for our oncology program through another third-party manufacturer.
We engage two separate manufacturers to provide bulk drug product for Translarna. We have a relationship with three manufacturers that are capable of providing fill and finish services for our finished commercial and clinical Translarna product, although we are still in the process of finalizing arrangements with one of these manufacturers with respect to commercial product services.
We do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of Translarna or any of our product candidates, although we may seek to establish such arrangements in the future. We may be unable to conclude agreements for commercial or clinical supply with third-party manufacturers, or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms.
We currently obtain our supplies of Translarna and our other product candidates from our third-party manufacturers pursuant to agreements that include specific supply timelines and volume expectations. If a manufacturer should become unavailable to us for any reason, we would seek to obtain supply from another manufacturer engaged by us for the applicable product or service. In the event that we were unable to procure the applicable supply from a validated manufacturer, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements for each of our outsourced services, however we likely would experience delays in our ability to supply Translarna to patients or in advancing our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers.
We obtain our supply of the drug substance for Emflaza through a third-party manufacturer that is currently the only third-party manufacturer qualified to provide Emflaza drug substance. All of our drug product manufacturing, processing and packaging needs for Emflaza tablet and suspension product are fulfilled pursuant to two different exclusive supply agreements assumed by us in connection with our acquisition of Emflaza. We expect to fulfill all of our requirements for Emflaza tablets as well as secondary packaging of pre-filled Emflaza oral suspension bottles pursuant to one of these agreements, which has an initial term of five years. We expect to fulfill all of our requirements for Emflaza suspension product pursuant to the other agreement. Through the seventh year anniversary of FDA approval of Emflaza, we are obligated to pay to the manufacturer of the Emflaza suspension product royalty payments, on a quarterly basis, based on a percentage (ranging from low to middle-low double digits) of, or a fixed payment with respect to, our annual net sales of suspension product in the United States, subject to reduction in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The royalty payments for the suspension product are subject to a minimum aggregate annual payment ranging from €0.5 million to €1.5 million per year.
If our drug substance provider or either of our drug product manufacturers was to be unable to provide drug substance or manufacture Emflaza product in sufficient quantities to meet projected demand, future sales could be adversely affected, which in turn could have a detrimental impact on our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the United States and on our ability to commercialize Emflaza, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and results of 
24

operations. Further, as we presently have no patent rights to protect the approved use of Emflaza, we expect to rely market exclusivity periods available to us under the Orphan Drug Act and Hatch-Waxman Act to commercialize Emflaza for DMD in the United States. As the holder of orphan exclusivity, we are required to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of Emflaza to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in loss of the drug's orphan exclusivity in the United States, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from sales of Emflaza.
We presently contract with third parties for the manufacturing of program materials for our gene therapy product candidates. The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively cost efficient. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with manufacturing and quality experience to oversee our contract manufacturers. Although we anticipate taking steps to increase our manufacturing capabilities for our gene therapy platform, we currently rely on third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our program materials to meet anticipated clinical trial and commercial scale demands. 
Translarna and Emflaza are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes. Our raw materials are not scarce and are readily available. We currently rely on a single source for the production of some raw materials and switching to an alternative source could, in some instances, take time and could lead to delays in manufacturing. No shortages or delays of raw materials were encountered in 2018, and none are currently expected in 2019. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Manufacturers and suppliers of product candidates are subject to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements, and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our third-party suppliers and manufacturers for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.
We currently have a contract with a pharmacy and hospital distributor in the European Union that distributes Translarna for clinical programs and limited commercial and EAP programs. We have engaged with third party logistic providers, or 3PLs, which distribute Translarna for the majority of our commercial and EAP programs on our behalf.
We utilize third parties for the commercial distribution of Emflaza, including a 3PL to warehouse Emflaza as well as a specialty pharmacy to sell and distribute Emflaza to patients. The specialty pharmacy provides us with third-party call center services to provide patient support and financial services, prescription intake and distribution, reimbursement adjudication, and ongoing compliance support.
Commercial Matters
Sales and marketing team
Our product revenue has been attributable to sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States and to sales of Emflaza for treatment of DMD in the United States. In addition to the United States and multiple European countries, we have employees in Latin America and Canada. As of December 31, 2018, our commercial team was comprised of approximately 110 employees, including support personnel and members of our commercial team who work with physicians, patient advocacy groups and other stakeholders who are involved in the treatment of patients suffering from the diseases for which we seek to develop treatments.
In addition, in select territories, we have engaged full time consultants, marketing partners and distribution partners to assist us with our international commercialization efforts for Translarna. We continue to evaluate new territories to determine in which geographies we might, if approved, choose to commercialize Translarna ourselves and in which geographies we might choose to collaborate with third parties. We expect that our internal team and partnership network will continue to grow, as needed, to maximize access to patients.
Customers
During 2018, our product revenue was attributable to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and to Emflaza for treatment of DMD. Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD was available on a commercial basis or via reimbursed EAP programs in multiple territories outside of the United States. In some territories, orders for Translarna are placed directly with us and in other territories we have engaged with third-party distributors. As a result, orders for Translarna are generally received from hospital and retail pharmacies and, in some cases, one of our third-party partner distributors. Our third-party distributors act as intermediaries between us and end-users and do not typically stock significant quantities of Translarna. The ultimate payor for Translarna is typically a government authority or institution or a third-party health insurer. The payment terms are generally 30 to 90 days after receipt of products.
Emflaza for treatment of DMD is available on a commercial basis throughout the United States. We utilize a single, exclusive specialty pharmacy to sell and distribute Emflaza to patients. The specialty pharmacy receives prescription orders for Emflaza directly from physicians and ships Emflaza directly to the end-user upon fulfillment of the order. As such, there is very little 
25

inventory of Emflaza stocked. The ultimate payor for Emflaza is typically a state health insurance program or a third-party health insurer. The payment terms are generally 30 to 90 days after receipt of products.
During 2018, three of our distributors each accounted for over 10% of our net product sales. Financial information about our net product revenues and other revenues generated in the principal geographic regions in which we operate and our long-lived assets is set forth in our financial statements and in Note 15, “Geographic Information” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Translarna and Emflaza can generally only be returned if agreed upon in writing by us and the product is not opened nor in receipt by the final user, except in the case of quality issues associated with the product. Product is generally shipped when a specific patient is approved by the applicable government or insurer and an individual prescription has been written. The right of return is eliminated as a matter of course when the product is dispensed to patients. We have never had a request for a product return for either Translarna or Emflaza.
In some countries, including those in Latin America, orders for named patient sales may be for multiple months of therapy, which can lead to an unevenness in orders which could result in significant fluctuations in quarterly net product sales.
Market Access Considerations
Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is currently available on a commercial basis in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom (including England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales). Commercial drug is also currently available in Germany, subject to the matters discussed below. We consider Translarna to be commercially available when a reference price for the drug is established in the applicable country and we are permitted to market treatment to patients.
Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is also currently available through EAP programs in select countries where funded named patient or cohort programs exist, both within the EEA and in other territories. These programs generally reference the EMA’s determinations with respect to our marketing authorization in the EEA. As of today, Translarna is available under EAP or similar styled programs in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, Greece, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Lebanon, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and United Arab Emirates. Generally, EAP programs allow for access to Translarna pursuant to a named patient program, under which a physician requests access to Translarna on behalf of the specific, or “named” patient or pursuant to a cohort program, which allows for a broader temporary authorization for use for nmDMD meeting the inclusion criteria. Our EAP programs are named patient or similar styled programs in all territories other than France, which is a cohort program.
Our ability to make Translarna available via commercial or EAP programs is dependent upon our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged two years and older. The marketing authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA as well as the specific obligation to conduct and submit the results of Study 041. See “Item 1. Business-Marketing authorization matters for Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy-European Economic Area” and “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates” for further information regarding the marketing authorization in the EEA and related risks.
Our future revenues from Translarna, Emflaza and any other product candidates we may develop, depends largely on our ability to obtain and maintain reimbursement from governments and third-party insurers. Each country in the EEA has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations and many countries in the EEA have other regulations related to the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products in the applicable country. The pricing and reimbursement process varies from country to country and can take a substantial amount of time from initiation to complete. As a result, our commercial launch in the EEA has been and is expected to continue to be on a country-by-country basis and we generally will not be able to commence commercial sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD pursuant to our marketing authorization in the EEA in any particular member state of the EEA until we conclude the applicable pricing and reimbursement negotiations and comply with any licensing, employment or related regulatory requirements in that country.
We have submitted pricing and reimbursement dossiers with respect to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in key EEA countries and have received both pricing and reimbursement approval on terms that are acceptable to us in a number of countries. The price that is approved by local governmental authorities pursuant to commercial pricing and reimbursement processes may be lower than the price that can be realized for purchases of product in that country pursuant to a reimbursed early access program.
In some instances, reimbursement may be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. For example, in France, EAP programs and commercial sales of a product can begin while pricing and reimbursement rates are under discussion with the applicable government health programs. In the event that the negotiated price of the product is lower than the amount reimbursed for sales made prior to the conclusion of price negotiations, we may become obligated to repay such excess amount to the applicable government health program. Such retroactive reimbursement would be made following the conclusion of price negotiations with the applicable government health authority.
26

We delisted Translarna from the German pharmacy ordering system, effective April 1, 2016, based on unsustainable pricing established by the arbitration board in Germany. However, patients and healthcare professionals in Germany have generally been able to access Translarna through a reimbursed importation pathway possible under German law. There can be no assurance that all such patients will continue to be successful in obtaining reimbursed access to Translarna.
For Emflaza, we are engaged in pricing, coverage and reimbursement discussions with third-party payors, such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private commercial insurance plans and pharmacy benefit management plans. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and the amount of reimbursement to be provided for Emflaza are made on a plan-by-plan, and in some cases, on a patient-by-patient basis. Coverage and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors, including the processing and adjudication of prescriptions, may vary from weeks to several months. Certain third-party payors routinely impose additional requirements before approving reimbursement of a prescription, including prior authorization and the requirement to try another therapy first. The specialty pharmacy we utilize provides patient services program to support product access and, when eligible, out-of-pocket assistance.
We record revenue net of estimated third party discounts and rebates. Allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time revenues from product sales are recognized. These allowances are adjusted to reflect known changes in factors and may impact such allowances in the quarter those changes are known.
For important information regarding market access and pricing and reimbursement considerations see “Item 1. Business-Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates” and “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates”.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of making branded products less attractive, from a cost perspective, to buyers.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of Translarna, Emflaza, PTC-AADC, Tegsedi, Waylivra, risdiplam and our other product candidates are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
The competition for Translarna, Emflaza and our other product candidates includes the following:

• | Translarna for nmDMD. There is currently no marketed therapy, other than Translarna in the EEA, which has received approval for the treatment of the underlying cause of nmDMD. Sarepta Therapeutics recently received approval in the United States for a treatment addressing the underlying cause of disease for different mutations in the DMD gene. Other biopharmaceutical companies are developing treatments addressing the underlying cause of disease for different mutations in the DMD gene (Sarepta, Daiichi Sankyo, Nippon Shinyaku, and Solid Biosciences). 


• | Translarna for Other Indications. Diacomit is marketed in the European Union by Laboratoires Biocodex for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. In the United States, both GW Pharmaceuticals and Zogenix have approved products for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. Aniridia therapeutic interventions, such as artificial iris implantation, are being developed by HumanOptics AG. 


• | Emflaza for DMD. The FDA has not approved a corticosteroid specifically for DMD in the United States other than Emflaza. However, prednisone/prednisolone, which is not approved for DMD in the United States, is generically available and has been prescribed off label for DMD patients. 


• | Gene therapy product candidates. Currently, no treatment options are available for the underlying cause of AADC deficiency, and care is limited to palliative options with significant burden on caregivers. Additionally, we are not aware of any late-stage development product candidates for AADC deficiency. While there is currently no treatment options

27

available for FA, Voyager Therapeutics is also working on pre-clinical studies for a potential gene therapy solution. Other gene therapy companies may in the future decide to utilize existing technologies to address unmet needs that could potentially compete with our product candidates.

• | Risdiplam. Risdiplam also faces competition. For example, in December 2016, the FDA approved nusinersen, a drug developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and marketed by Biogen, to treat SMA. AveXis, Inc., (acquired by Novartis in 2018) is also evaluating a gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of SMA. Other companies are also pursuing product candidates for the treatment of SMA, including Trophos (also in collaboration with Roche), Kowa, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, and Cytokinetics. 


• | Waylivra. If approved, Waylivra could face competition from drugs like metreleptin. Metreleptin, produced by Novelion Therapeutics, Inc., is currently approved for use in generalized lipodystrophy patients.


• | Tegsedi. Tegsedi could face competition from drugs like patisiran and ALN-TTRsc02 in development by Alnylam, tafamidis commercialized in some countries in LATAM by Pfizer and tolcapone in development by SOM Biotech.

Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, quality control, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, recordkeeping, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. In addition, sponsors of biopharmaceutical products and drug products participating in Medicaid and Medicare are required to comply with mandatory price reporting, discount, and rebate requirements. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates” for important information regarding some of the risks to our business arising as a result of government regulation.
U.S. government regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologic products, including gene therapy products, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving drugs and biologic products. Applications to the FDA are required before conducting human clinical testing of drugs or biologic products. Failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements at any time pre- or post-approval may result in a delay of approval or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, withdrawal of an approval, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution, among other actions further described in this filing. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Regulatory requirements governing our business are also evolving. For example, until recently, the National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, also reviewed certain proposed gene therapy trials pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines,; however, the NIH recently proposed to change this practice so that the RAC will no longer review individual human gene transfer protocols. Certain aspects of the NIH Guidelines, such as review of studies by Institutional Biosafety Committees, or IBCs remain in effect. The NIH has stated that it will finalize this change after taking public comments. The FDA has issued a growing body of guidance documents on CMC, clinical investigations and other areas of gene therapy development, all of which are intended to facilitate the industry’s development of gene therapy products.
The new drug and biologic approval process
In the United States, the information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain approval to market a new drug or biologic product varies depending upon whether the drug is a new product whose safety and efficacy have not previously been demonstrated in humans or a drug whose active ingredients and certain other properties are the same as those of a previously approved drug. A New Drug Application, or NDA, is the vehicle through which the FDA approves a new pharmaceutical drug product for sale and marketing in the United States. A Biologics License Application, or BLA, is the vehicle through which the FDA approves a new biologic product for sale and marketing in the United States.
To market a new drug or biologics product in the United States, a sponsor generally must undertake the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and other applicable laws or regulations;


• | submission with the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for clinical testing, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin at United States clinical trial sites;

28


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, and in the case of gene therapy studies, IBC, prior to initiation and subject to continuing review;


• | completion of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy, in the case of a drug product candidate, or safety purity, and potency, in the case of a biologic product candidate for its intended use, performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, and the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, E6 GCP guidelines. Gene therapy research must also be conducted in accordance with the NIH Guidelines;


• | development of manufacturing processes to ensure the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency;


• | submission and FDA acceptance of an NDA, in the case of a drug product candidate, or BLA in the case of a biologic product candidate, and satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee meeting, if applicable;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, which require that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites and selected clinical investigators to determine GCP compliance; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.

Preclinical Studies and IND Submission
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, pharmacology, stability, toxicity and product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. In order to begin clinical testing, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA, which includes, among other things, the results of the preclinical tests, manufacturing information, analytical data, proposed clinical protocols, and any available clinical data or literature on the product candidate. Some preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. In other words, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence or continue a clinical trial.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial and subsequent protocol amendments must be filed with the FDA as part of the IND. All research subjects or their legally authorized representatives must provide their informed consent in writing prior to their participation in a clinical trial. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB and is subject to ongoing IRB monitoring. The IRB must approve the protocol, protocol amendments, the informed consent form, and communications to study subjects before a study commences at the site. An IRB considers among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, and whether the planned human subject protections are adequate. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. In the case of gene therapy studies, an IBC at the local level must also review and maintain oversight over the particular study, in addition to the IRB. If the product candidate is being investigated for multiple intended indications, separate INDs may also be required. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events or other significant safety information is found. Certain reports may also be required to be submitted to the IBC.
Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of the trial. This group may also review interim data to assess the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. The data safety monitoring board receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise the sponsor to halt the clinical trial if it determined there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or on other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to be publicly posted on the Clinicaltrials.gov website. Sponsors or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious disease or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access requests. Investigators must also provide certain information to clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. 
The manufacture of investigational drugs and biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and biologics and active ingredients and therapeutic substances imported into the United States are also 
29

subject to regulation by the FDA. Further, the export of investigational products outside the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA. 
In general, for the purposes of NDA and BLA approval, human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 clinical trials may be conducted in patients or healthy volunteers to evaluate the product’s safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism distribution, excretion, and pharmacokinetics and, if possible, seek to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve controlled trials in a larger but still relatively small number of subjects from the relevant patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks; and provide a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of the drug or biologic product for specific indications.
Phase 2 clinical trials are sometimes denoted by companies as Phase 2a or Phase 2b clinical trials. Phase 2a clinical trials typically represent the first human clinical trial of a drug or biologic product candidate in a smaller patient population and are designed to provide earlier information on safety and efficacy. Phase 2b clinical trials typically involve larger numbers of patients or longer durations of therapy and may involve comparison with placebo, standard treatments or other active comparators.
Phase 3 clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to generate enough data to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and safety of the product candidate for approval. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve comparison with placebo, standard treatments or other active comparators. These trials are well-controlled and are intended to establish the overall risk- benefit profile of the product or product candidate and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials are usually larger, more time consuming, more complex and more costly than Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.
Additional kinds of data may also help support a BLA or NDA, such as patient experience data and real world evidence. Real world evidence may also be used to assist in clinical trial design or support an NDA for already approved products. For genetically targeted populations and variant protein targeted products intended to address an unmet medical need in one or more patient subgroups with a serious or life threatening rare disease or condition, the FDA may allow a sponsor to rely upon data and information previously developed by the sponsor or for which the sponsor has a right of reference, that was submitted previously to support an approved application for a product that incorporates or utilizes the same or similar genetically targeted technology or a product that is the same or utilizes the same variant protein targeted drug as the product that is the subject of the application.
Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the sponsor, or a data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial if the trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the research has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. IBCs can also require that research activities be ceased if applicable requirements are not being met. The FDA typically requires that an NDA or BLA include data from two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, but approval may be based upon a single adequate and well-controlled clinical trial plus confirmatory evidence. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA on the applicant’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm or refute the effectiveness of a product candidate, and can provide important safety information.
The FDA’s accelerated approval process allows for potentially faster development and approval of certain drugs or biologic products intended to treat serious or life- threatening illnesses that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. Under the accelerated approval process, the adequate and well-controlled clinical trials conducted with the drug or biologics product establish that the drug or biologics product has an effect on a “surrogate” endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs or biologics products approved through the accelerated approval process are subject to certain post-approval requirements, including that the applicant complete Phase 4 clinical trials to demonstrate the drug’s or biological product’s clinical benefit. If the trials fail to verify the clinical benefit of the drug or biologics product, the FDA may withdraw approval of the application through a streamlined process. Promotional materials for a drug or biologic approved under the accelerated approval pathway are subject to FDA prior review.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the drug or biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
30

If a drug or biologic product’s approved indication is dependent on the measurement or detection of specified biomarkers, the therapeutic approval may require the contemporaneous approval or clearance of an in vitro companion diagnostic device. An in vitro companion diagnostic device provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The use of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product is stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product. The FDA has explained in guidance in vitro diagnostic companion diagnostic devices may be used for a number of purposes, including identifying appropriate subpopulations for treatment. According to the guidance, in vitro companion diagnostic devices may require the submission and approval of a preauthorization application before they are marketed. Some in vitro companion diagnostic devices, however, could potentially be cleared through a 510(k) premarket notification submission. The guidance states that the FDA generally will not approve a drug or biologic that is dependent upon the use of an in vitro companion diagnostic device if no such device is contemporaneously FDA- approved or -cleared for the relevant indication. According to the guidance, however, the FDA may approve such a product without an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device when the drug or biologic is intended to treat a serious or life- threatening condition for which no satisfactory alternative treatment exists and the FDA determines that the benefits from the use of the product are so pronounced as to outweigh the risks from the lack of an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device. Under these circumstances, the FDA expects that a diagnostic would be subsequently approved or cleared through an appropriate device submission, and that the therapeutic product labeling would be revised to stipulate the use of the diagnostic device. The FDA would also consider whether additional protections, such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, or post-approval requirements, are necessary. 
In a separate guidance, specific to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and related dystrophinopathies, the FDA has stated that for drugs and biologics in which efficacy or safety may be related to the patient’s specific dystrophin mutation or to another type of finding related to a biomarker for which a suitable diagnostic device is not available, a sponsor should contemporaneously develop a companion diagnostic device. However, given the serious and life-threatening nature of dystrophinopathies and the lack of satisfactory alternative treatments that currently exist, the guidance further states that, the FDA may approve a drug or biologic even if a companion diagnostic device is not yet approved or cleared, if the benefits are so pronounced as to outweigh the risks from the lack of an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device. During the review, the FDA will determine the need for clearance or approval of the device. The FDA guidance documents represent the FDA’s current thinking on a topic but do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including proposed labeling and information on the chemistry, manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee, though a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Product candidates that are designated as orphan products are not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication. The user fees must be paid at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted, by section, on a rolling basis. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.
If the FDA determines that the NDA or BLA is incomplete, the FDA may refuse to file the application. If the FDA refuses to file an NDA or BLA, the applicant may refile the application with information addressing the FDA identified deficiencies, which refiling would be subject to FDA review before it is accepted for filing, or the applicant may request an informal conference with the FDA about whether the application should be filed. After the conference, the applicant may request that the application be filed over protest. When an application is filed over protest, the FDA is required to review the application as filed. Generally, the FDA does not favor the file over protest procedure. There are also certain consequences of filing an application over protest. For example, such an application would not be eligible for certain FDA communications over the course of the review cycle. 
In addition, an applicant that receives an RTF can, in some circumstances, appeal the decision using the FDA’s dispute resolution procedures. After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product meets FDA’s approval standard and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set the review goal of completing its review of 90% of all applications for new molecular entities within ten months of the 60-day filing date. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for review of NDAs or BLAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by additional three-month review periods whenever the FDA requests or the NDA or BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review cycle. If, however, an application is filed with the FDA over protest, the FDA generally will not review amendments to the application during any review cycle and will not issue information requests to the applicant during the agency’s review.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs for a new active ingredient, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration, unless subject to the below requirement for molecularly 
31

targeted cancer products, must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. PREA does not generally apply to products for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, PREA compliance may be required if approval is sought for other indications for which the product has not received orphan designation.
The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 introduced a new provision regarding required pediatric studies. Under this statute, for product candidates intended for the treatment of adult cancer which are directed at molecular targets that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of pediatric cancer, original application sponsors must submit, with the marketing application, reports from molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigations designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each applicable age group, to inform potential pediatric labeling. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals or waivers of some or all of this data, as above. Unlike PREA, orphan products are not exempt from this requirement.
The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP before approving an NDA or BLA. The FDA also will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product is manufactured before the NDA or BLA is approved. The FDA will not approve the product unless current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also take into account results of inspections performed by certain counterpart foreign regulatory agencies in assessing compliance with GCP or cGMP. The FDA has entered into international agreements with foreign agencies, including the EMA, in order to facilitate this type of information sharing. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.
Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary FDA approvals, which could delay or prevent us from marketing our products. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or biologic products to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. Specifically, for a product candidate for which no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of active ingredients) has previously been approved by the FDA, the FDA must either refer that product candidate to an advisory committee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why the FDA did not refer the product candidate to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer other product candidates to an advisory committee if FDA believes that the advisory committee’s expertise would be beneficial. The advisory committee process may cause delays in the approval timeline. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully, particularly any negative recommendations or limitations, when making drug or biologic product approval decisions.
After evaluating the marketing application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval and describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the marketing application, and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either: resubmit the marketing application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has the goal of reviewing 90% of application resubmissions in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission. However, if the application that was the subject of a CRL was filed over protest, these review timeframes do not apply and any such resubmission will be reviewed by FDA as available resources permit. Moreover, even with submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and may take years to complete. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all.
Even if approval is granted, the FDA may limit the indications for use, approve narrow labeling relegating a drug or biologic product to second- line or later-line use, add limitations of use to the labeling or place other conditions on approvals, which could restrict the marketing of the products. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including black box warnings, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms 
32

under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may also not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or label claims, which may themselves require further clinical testing, or changing the manufacturing process are subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA may also withdraw the product approval if compliance with the pre-and post-marketing regulatory standards are not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace, among other consequences. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling, or FDA notification may be required. 
Additional regulation for gene therapy clinical trials
In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and long term follow up to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, long-term follow up may be required for gene therapies to assess delayed adverse events. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials.
Post-approval requirements 
After FDA approval of a product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements, including, among other things, establishment registration and product listing, record-keeping requirements, reporting certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, providing updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. As a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may require the applicant to conduct additional clinical trials or other post market testing and surveillance to further monitor and assess the product’s safety and efficacy. There also are continuing annual program user fee requirements for approved products, though orphan products may receive exemptions. 
The FDA also has the authority to require a specific REMS to ensure the safe use of the drug or biologic. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the product, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the product, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the product’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the product, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The REMS strategy must be approved by the FDA. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on an approved product if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the product’s benefits outweigh its risks.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians may prescribe a drug or biologic for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote the product for the approved indications and in accordance with the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing advertising and promotion can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, warning and untitled letters from the FDA, requests for corrective advertising or communications with doctors, civil penalties or criminal prosecution, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal or orders under existing government contracts, among others.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of samples at the federal level. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, added new sections in the FDCA that require manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, dispensers, and third-party logistics providers to take steps to identify and trace certain prescription drugs and biologics to protect against the threats of counterfeit, diverted, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful products in the supply chain. The DSCSA regulates the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical drugs and biologics, requiring passage of documentation to track and trace each prescription product at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. This documentation must be transferred electronically. Products subject to the DSCSA must only be transferred to appropriately licensed purchasers. The DSCSA also requires manufacturers and repackagers to affix or imprint a unique product identifier (comprised of a standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product) on product packages in both a human-readable and on a machine-readable data carrier.  The standardized numerical identifier is comprised of the product’s corresponding National Drug Code combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number.  A product is misbranded if it does not bear the product identifier. The DSCSA also establishes several requirements relating to the 
33

verification of product identifiers. Further, under this legislation, sponsors have product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences of death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Similar requirements additionally are and will be imposed through this legislation on other companies within the biopharmaceutical product supply chain, such as distributors and dispensers, as well as certain sponsor licensees and affiliates. Implementation of the DSCSA requirements, such as the product identifier requirements has imposed and will continue to impose increased costs and administrative burdens and may lead to potential liability associated with the marketing and sale of products subject to these requirements. The PDMA, DSCSA, and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and specifications, and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use.
Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process for a commercial product.
Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market among other consequences further described in this filing. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product and product candidates. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action, among other consequences further described in this filing, that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
Once approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if issues bearing on the product’s safety or efficacy are discovered. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data or other information may also require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Such actions may include refusal to approve pending applications, license or approval suspension or revocation, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, provision of corrective information, imposition of post-market requirements including the need for additional testing, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, FDA debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, and adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences. New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established that could delay or prevent FDA approval of our products under development or negatively impact the marketing of any future approved products.
Additional controls for biologics
To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer.
34

In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 
Orphan drug designation.
We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment nmDMD and nonsense mutation aniridia, for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA, for PTC-FD for the treatment of Friedreich ataxia and PTC-AS for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs and biologics intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which is defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that product. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the already approved product and is intended for the same indication. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan drug designation can provide opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and FDA user-fee benefits. The tax advantages, however, were limited in 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or the same drug or biologic for different indications. However, competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity. The FDA awarded an orphan drug designation to Emflaza for the treatment of patients with DMD and approved Emflaza on February 9, 2017, as the first corticosteroid approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with DMD, granting Emflaza orphan drug exclusivity for this disease as of the date of approval.
Rare Pediatric Disease Voucher Program
Under the FDCA, the FDA awards priority review vouchers to sponsors of rare pediatric disease products that meet certain criteria. To qualify, the rare disease must be serious or life-threatening in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years. Also, the product must contain no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) that has been previously approved in any other application and the application must meet certain additional qualifying criteria, including eligibility for FDA priority review. If FDA determines that a product is for a rare pediatric disease and the qualifying application criteria are met, upon a sponsor’s request, FDA may award the sponsor a priority review voucher. This voucher may be redeemed to receive priority review (i.e., a review time of 6 months as compared to 10 months for standard review) of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. Use of a priority review voucher is subject to an FDA user fee. These vouchers are transferable. Accordingly, sponsors may sell these vouchers for substantial sums of money. Vouchers may also be revoked by FDA under certain circumstances and sponsors of approved rare pediatric disease products must submit certain reports to FDA.
Changes to the FDCA, however, have limited the future use of pediatric priority review vouchers. Under the law’s sunset provision, the drug or biologic must be designated by FDA for a rare pediatric disease no later than September 30, 2020, and approved no later than September 30, 2022, unless the law is reauthorized by Congress. Accordingly, while PTC-AADC currently has a rare pediatric disease designation, if we cannot secure FDA BLA approval prior to September 30, 2022, we may not be able to receive the benefit of such designation. 
Hatch-Waxman Act for Drugs.
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of drug marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained the right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that generally has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product, called the reference listed drug. Certain differences, however, between the reference listed drug and ANDA product may be permitted pursuant to a suitability petition. Certain labeling differences may also be permitted if information in the reference listed drug’s label is protected by patent or exclusivities. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required 
35

to include preclinical (animal)and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applications must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients to the site of action in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicants drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s list of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. 
Upon submission of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patient information has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacturer, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA approval cannot be made effective until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. 
If the ANDA of 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the certification to the NDA and patent holders. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification, in which case the FDA may not make an approval effective until the earlier of 30 months from the patent or application owner’s receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent is favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA of 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation.
In addition to the above, the Hatch Waxman Act established certain periods of regulatory exclusivity. As we presently have no patent rights to protect the approved use of Emflaza, we rely on non-patent market exclusivity periods under the Orphan Drug Act and the Hatch-Waxman Act to commercialize Emflaza in the United States.
Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA generally may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
The FDCA also provides a shorter three-year period of market exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Three-year exclusivity may be granted for example, for new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
BPCIA Exclusivity
We are currently pursuing patent protection for GT-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, and, in the meantime, we expect to rely on the twelve-year BPCIA regulatory exclusivity to commercialize PTC-AADC in the United States, if it is approved.
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act included the BPCIA as a subtitle. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. As of January 1, 2019, the FDA has approved sixteen biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars have been approved. The FDA has issued a number of guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there  is a high degree of similarity to the reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, 
36

animal studies, and at least one clinical trial, absent a waiver by the FDA. There must be no difference between the reference product and a biosimilar in mechanism of action, conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the FDA must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. However, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the 12 year exclusivity period. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. 
The BPCIA also includes provisions to protect reference products that have patent protection. The biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether there should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an action for declaratory judgment concerning the patent.
Patent Term Restoration
If approved, drug and biologic products may also be eligible for periods of U.S. patent term restoration. If granted, patent term restoration extends the patent life of a single unexpired patent, that has not previously been extended, for a maximum of five years. The total patent life of the product with the extension also cannot exceed fourteen years from the product’s approval date. Subject to the prior limitations, the period of the extension is calculated by adding half of the time from the effective date of an IND to the initial submission of a marketing application, and all the time between the submission of the marketing application and its approval. This period may also be reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence. 
Pediatric exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent market exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of market protection to the term of any existing Orange Book- listed patents or regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity periods described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study or studies in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study or studies within a specified timeframe prior to the expiration of the underlying patent or market exclusivity period to be extended. 
Regulation outside the United States
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. And, even if regulatory approval is granted, it may be withdrawn or limited under certain circumstances or post-approval requirements may be imposed by the applicable regulatory authority. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
Regulation in the European Union
We have obtained an orphan medicinal product designation from the European Commission, following an evaluation by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, Becker muscular dystrophy and aniridia - but have only received conditional marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. The European Commission can grant orphan medicinal product designation to products for which the sponsor can establish that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union, or (2) a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would generate a sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. In addition, the sponsor must establish that there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed 
37

orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation is not a marketing authorization. It is a designation that provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized EU marketing authorization, as well as 10 years of EU market exclusivity following a marketing authorization. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA, nor the European Commission nor any EU member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In addition, a competing similar medicinal product may in limited circumstances be authorized prior to the expiration of the market exclusivity period, including if it is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to our product. Our product and product candidates can lose orphan designation, and the related benefits, prior to us obtaining a marketing authorization if it is demonstrated that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met.
Overview of application process.    To obtain regulatory approval of a drug under the European Union’s regulatory systems and authorization procedures, an applicant may submit marketing authorization applications under a centralized, decentralized, or national procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, like Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, and medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, and optional for certain other innovative products. The centralized procedure enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid in all EU member states based on a single application. Under the centralized procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, is required to adopt an opinion on a valid application within 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions. More specifically, on day 120 of the procedure, once the CHMP has received the preliminary assessment reports and opinions from the rapporteur and co-rapporteur, it prepares a list of potential outstanding issues, referred to as “other concerns” or “major objections”. These are sent to the applicant together with CHMP’s recommendation. The CHMP can make one of two recommendations: (1) the marketing authorization could be granted provided that satisfactory answers are given to the “other concerns” and/or “major objections” identified and that all conditions outlined in the list of outstanding issues are implemented and complied with; or (2) the product is not approvable since there are “major objections”.
Applicants have three months from the date of receiving the potential outstanding issues to respond to the CHMP, and can request a three-month extension if necessary. The granting of a marketing authorization will depend on the recommendations and potential major objections identified by the CHMP as well as the ability of the applicant to adequately respond to these findings. An accelerated assessment can be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision on the marketing authorization application must be adopted by the European Commission, after consulting the European Union member states, which in total can take more than 60 days.
An applicant for a marketing authorization application may request a re-examination in the event of a negative opinion, in connection with which CHMP appoints new rapporteurs. Within 60 days of receipt of the negative opinion, the applicant must submit a document explaining the basis for its request for re-examination. The CHMP has 60 days to consider the applicant’s request for re-examination. The applicant may request an oral explanation before the CHMP, which is routinely granted, following which CHMP will adopt a final opinion. The final opinion, whether positive or negative, is published by the CHMP shortly following the CHMP meeting at which the oral explanation takes place.
Conditional marketing authorizations.    In specific circumstances, as with Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, EU legislation enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization on a conditional basis prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for products designated as orphan medicinal products, if (1) the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs, and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the benefit-risk balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. The granting of a conditional marketing authorization will depend on the applicant’s ability to fulfill the conditions imposed within the agreed upon deadline.
38

For important information about matters that may adversely affect our ability to renew our conditional marketing authorization for Translarna, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates” and “Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates.”
Variations to conditional marketing authorizations.    After the granting of a conditional marketing authorization, the marketing authorization holder may submit an application to vary the conditional marketing authorization under a variation procedure. In the case of the introduction of an additional therapeutic indication, the timeframe for the variation procedure for the initial assessment of the dossier is generally 90 days (plus up to 20 days for validation).
However, in the framework of a variation application assessment procedure, the EMA may send one or more requests for supplementary information to the marketing authorization holder, requiring that additional information be provided by the marketing authorization holder to support its variation application. Such supplementary requests will be sent together with a timetable stating the date by when the marketing authorization holder must submit the requested data and, where appropriate, the extended evaluation period to be applied to such variation procedure. The 90-day variation procedure may be suspended for up to three months for the marketing authorization holder to submit its responses to such supplementary requests. The marketing authorization holder will be notified of the outcome of the CHMP’s assessment of the variation procedure within 15 days from the adoption of the CHMP opinion. If unfavorable, the CHMP opinion may be subject to a re-examination procedure upon the marketing authorization holder’s request. This may imply an additional minimum two-month procedure. If the CHMP opinion is favorable, the European Commission will usually vary the marketing authorization to introduce the additional therapeutic indication within approximately two months from the receipt of the final CHMP opinion.
Additional requirements and considerations.    Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver, or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. In the case of orphan medicinal products, completion of an approved PIP can result in an extension of the aforementioned market exclusivity period from ten to twelve years.
In the European Union, independently generated data submitted as part of a full marketing authorization application dossier are protected by regulatory data protection (‘data exclusivity’) for a period of eight years from the granting of a marketing authorization for a ‘reference product’. This means that for a period of eight years, competent authorities may not accept marketing authorization applications that rely on the independently generated data in the marketing authorization dossier of the reference product. Generic medicinal products that rely on the independently generated data of the reference product may not be placed on the market for 10 years from the granting of the initial marketing authorization for the reference medicinal product. This is extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications considered to offer a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. These periods of data exclusivity and market exclusivity do not prevent other companies from obtaining a marketing authorization based on their own independently generated data.
If a marketing authorization is granted in the EEA for a medicinal product, such as the marketing authorization granted for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD by the European Commission, the marketing authorization holder is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal products that are in addition to the other conditions of the marketing authorization described above. The marketing authorization holder must, for example, comply with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post- authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. Other requirements relate to, for example, the manufacturing of products and active pharmaceutical ingredients in accordance with good manufacturing practice standards. Competent authorities of EU member states may conduct inspections to verify compliance with applicable requirements, and the marketing authorization holder will have to continue to expend time, money and effort to remain compliant. Non-compliance with EU requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties in the EU Similarly, failure to comply with the EU’s requirements regarding the protection of individual personal data can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. Individual EU member states may also impose various sanctions and penalties in case we do not comply with locally applicable requirements.
Off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The applicable laws at European Union level and in the individual European Union member states also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the European Union could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict our promotional activities with health care professionals. In addition, legislation adopted at the European Union level and by individual European Union member states require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. Promotion of indications not covered by the SmPC is specifically prohibited.
39

The EMA is responsible for coordinating inspections to verify compliance with the principles of good clinical practice, or GCP, good manufacturing practice, or GMP, good laboratory practice, or GLP, and good pharmacovigilance practice, or GVP. These inspections are also intended to verify compliance with other aspects of the supervision of authorized medicinal products in use in the European Union. The EMA coordinates any inspection by the relevant member state regulatory authority as requested by the CHMP in connection with the assessment of marketing authorization applications or matters referred to these committees. Inspections may be routine or triggered by issues arising during the assessment of the dossier or by other information, such as previous inspection experience. Inspections usually are requested during the initial review of a marketing authorization application, but could arise post-authorization.
Inspectors are drawn from the regulatory authorities of member states of the European Union and the European Economic Area. Following an inspection, the inspectors provide a written inspection report to the inspected site or applicant and provide an opportunity for response. Some inspection reports require follow-up and may result in additional adverse consequences due to critical or major findings. The inspectors and the CHMP will comment on any response from an inspected site or applicant and may monitor future compliance with any proposed corrective action plan.
In the GCP area, inspectors grade their findings according to the following scale:

• | Critical: Conditions, practices or processes that adversely affect the rights, safety or well-being of the subjects or the quality and integrity of data. Observations classified as critical may include a pattern of deviations classified as major.


• | Major: Conditions, practices or processes that might adversely affect the rights, safety or well-being of the subjects and/or the quality and integrity of data. Observations classified as major may include a pattern of deviations or numerous minor observations.


• | Minor: Conditions, practices or processes that would not be expected to adversely affect the rights, safety or wellbeing of the subjects or the quality and integrity of data. Minor observations indicate the need for improvement of conditions, practices and processes.


• | Comments: Suggestions on how to improve quality or reduce the potential for a deviation to occur in the future.

Possible consequences of critical and major findings include rejection of clinical trial data, causing significant delays in obtaining final marketing authorization, or other direct action by national regulatory authorities.
Early access programs
Many jurisdictions allow the supply of unauthorized medicinal products in the context of strictly regulated and exceptional EAP programs, and some countries may provide reimbursement for drugs provided in the context of such programs. In the European Union, the legal basis for EAP programs, also referred to as named-patient and compassionate use programs, is set out in the EU legislation regulating the authorization, manufacture, distribution and marketing of medicinal products. Detailed regulatory requirements applicable to EAP programs have been adopted and implemented by EU member states in their national laws. The promotion, advertising and marketing of unauthorized medicinal products is generally prohibited, and authorization for EAP programs must generally be obtained from national competent authorities, which might not grant such authorization. Obtaining authorization for an EAP program in one country does not ensure that authorization will be obtained in another country. 
U.S. law permits “expanded access” (also known as compassionate use and treatment use) for certain patients with serious diseases who have no comparable alternative treatment options. The potential patient benefit must justify the potential risks of the treatment use and those potential risks must not be unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be treated. Moreover, providing the investigational drug or biologic for the requested use must not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the expanded access use or otherwise compromise the potential development of the expanded access use. Additional requirements apply depending on the size of the expanded access population. To provide expanded access, sponsors, including individual physicians, must submit detailed regulatory information to the FDA and receive the agency’s approval for the use. However, if there is an emergency that requires that a patient be treated before a written submission can be made, the FDA may authorize the expanded access use by telephone. In such a case, a written expanded access submission must be submitted to the FDA within fifteen working days of the FDA’s authorization. Following approval for expanded access use, both the sponsor of the use and the investigator (i.e., physician) must comply with certain FDA requirements. Sponsors may not promote products as safe or effective for expanded-access uses.
U.S. law further permits access to investigational drugs or biologics for treatment use under new federal Right to Try legislation. Under this law, patients diagnosed with a life-threatening disease or condition, who have exhausted all approved treatment options, may be able to obtain access, with the agreement of the product manufacturer and the patient’s physician to certain investigational drugs and biologics. The patient must further be unable to participate in a clinical trial involving the investigational drug or biologic and must provide informed consent. If all of the statutory criteria are satisfied, FDA approval of the use of the investigational drug or biologic for patient treatment is not required but certain reports must be submitted to the agency annually. Individual states also have their own Right to Try statutes.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
40

The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus of this effort. Foreign governments, the U.S. government, and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.
In some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing and reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. In some countries, governments can set conditions that must be satisfied for prices to be set at a certain value. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing and reimbursement negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states, and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high- priced member states), can further reduce prices. In some countries we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product or product candidate to other available therapies in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval.
In the United States, federal price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics used to determine prescription rebates paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and amounts reimbursed pharmacies and other providers by the Medicaid and Medicare programs. Various state health care programs similarly obligate us to report drug pricing information that is used as the basis for their reimbursement of pharmacies and other health care providers. Payment for a manufacturer’s drugs by these programs is conditioned on submission of this pricing information. Some government health care programs impose penalties if drug price increases exceed specified percentages or inflation rates, and these penalties can result in mandatory penny prices for certain federal and 340B program customers. States, such as California, have also enacted transparency laws that require manufacturers to report price increases and related information, and cap price increases. Failure to comply with the rules for calculating and submitting pricing information or otherwise overcharging the government or its beneficiaries may result in criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions, and expose us to False Claims Act liability.
The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 requires, as a condition of payment by certain federal agencies and the Medicaid program, that manufacturers of “covered drugs” (including all drugs approved under an NDA) enter into a Master Agreement and Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs through which their covered drugs must be offered for sale at a mandatory ceiling price to certain federal agencies, including the VA and Department of Defense. FSS contracts require compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations, including disclosure of commercial prices during contract negotiations and maintenance of price relationships during the term of the contract, and subject manufacturers to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions. The Veterans Health Care Act also requires manufacturers to enter into pricing agreements with the Department of Health and Human Services to charge no more than a different ceiling price (derived from the Medicaid rebate percentage) to covered entities participating in the 340B drug discount program. Failure to provide the mandatory discount may subject the manufacturer to specific civil monetary penalties. Termination of either of these agreements also jeopardizes payment by Medicaid for the manufacturer’s drugs. 
Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. For example, in the United States, healthcare reform measures under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to together as the Affordable Care Act, contain provisions that may affect the profitability of drug products. However, since its passage, Congress has repealed and amended certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act, and repeal efforts may occur again, and there are ongoing legal challenges to the Affordable Care Actwhich may contribute to the uncertainty of the ongoing implementation and impact of the Affordable Care Act and also underscores the potential for additional reform going forward. Certain provisions of enacted or proposed legislative changes may negatively impact coverage and reimbursement of healthcare items and services. We cannot assure that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.
Legislators and regulators at both the federal and state level are increasingly focused on containing the cost of drugs, and there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, recently reduced the payment rate for certain hospitals purchasing outpatient drugs at the 340B program discounted price, and in 2016, CMS issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program, which among other things, revises the manner in which the “average manufacturer price” is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. Similarly, 340B program guidance regulations on civil monetary penalties for statutory violations, which had been was finalized in early 2017, recently went into effect. In October 2018, CMS issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking paving the way for a proposed rule in 2019 that would significantly 
41

reduce the price of drugs paid by Medicare Part B by basing reimbursement on the average prices among other industrialized countries, and in January 2019, CMS proposed eliminating the Anti-Kickback Act safe harbor for rebates typically provided to PBMs and health plans that are included in their cost effectiveness determinations. These and any additional healthcare reform measures could further constrain our business or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in additional pricing pressures.
Any regulatory approval of a product is limited to specific diseases and indications for which such product has been deemed safe and effective by the FDA. Coverage by federal healthcare programs, however, may be more limited than the indications for which a drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ coverage of the same products. Sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs (such as, in the United States, Medicare and Medicaid), private health insurers and other organizations. Obtaining reimbursement for orphan drugs may be particularly difficult because of the significant research and development challenges and costs and resulting pricing considerations typically associated with drugs developed to treat conditions that affect a small population of patients. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict requirements for reimbursement in connection with drugs that are perceived as having high costs. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors.
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third- party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our product or product candidates or conduct direct head-to-head studies to demonstrate clinical superiority and cost-effectiveness. Our products and product candidates may not be considered clinically superior and cost-effective to competitor products.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.
For important information regarding certain pricing and reimbursement matters see “Item 1. Business-Market Access Considerations” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor titled “Commercialization of Translarna has been in, and is expected to continue to take place in, countries that tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues. Failure to obtain and maintain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and other countries where Translarna is available would delay or prevent us from marketing our product in such regions, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”
Freedom of Information Requests and Affirmative Disclosures
We are also subject, in the U.S. and many other countries, to various regulatory schemes that require disclosure of clinical trial data or allow access to our data via freedom of information requests. We have been and may, from time to time, be notified by regulators, such as the EMA or the competent authorities of EU member states that they have received a freedom of information request for documents that they hold relating to our company, including information related to our product or our product candidates. For example, in 2015, we were notified by the EMA that it had received from another pharmaceutical company a request under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 seeking access to aspects of our marketing authorization application for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Following the decision of the EMA to release such documentation with only minimal redactions we initiated litigation before the General Court of the European Union to prevent disclosure of this information. In the first quarter of 2018, the Court ruled in favor of the EMA, allowing the EMA to release the documentation. We have appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the EMA has confirmed that it will not release the documents while the matter is still subject to the appeal process. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the appeal and we may not ultimately succeed in preventing disclosure of the data in our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In addition, under policies recently adopted in the EU, clinical trial data submitted to the EMA in MAAs that were traditionally regarded as confidential commercial information is now subject to automatic public disclosure. Further, once the Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 is fully in place, the sponsor of an EU trial must submit a summary of the results to an EU database within a year of the end of the trial. In addition, where the trial was intended to be used for obtaining a marketing authorization the applicant must submit the clinical study report 30 days after MA has been granted, refused or withdrawn. Subject to our limited ability to review and redact a narrow sub-set of confidential commercial information, these new EU policies will result in the EMA’s public disclosure of certain of our clinical study reports, clinical trial data summaries and clinical overviews for recently completed and future MAA submissions. The move toward public disclosure of development data could adversely affect our business in many ways, including, for example, resulting in the disclosure of our confidential methodologies for development of our products, preventing us from obtaining intellectual property right protection for innovations, requiring us to allocate significant resources to prevent other companies from violating our intellectual property rights, adding even more complexity to processing health data from clinical 
42

trials consistent with applicable data privacy regulations, and enabling competitors to use our data to gain approvals for their own products.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
Any present or future arrangements or interactions with third-party payors, healthcare providers and professionals, patients and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may restrict certain marketing and contracting practices. These laws include, and are not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims statutes.
Both the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or Bribery Act are broad in scope and will require companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA prohibits the offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official, political party or candidate for public office in order to improperly influence any act or decision, secure any other improper advantage, or obtain or retain business. The FCPA also prohibits any U.S. person from corruptly acting outside the U.S. in furtherance of such offer, promise or payment. Under the UK Bribery Act, companies which carry on a business or part of a business in the United Kingdom may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including non-UK government officials and private persons, by employees and persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company. Similar statutes have been adopted, or may be adopted in the future, by other countries in which we operate and with which we are or may be required to comply.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, or order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute imposes criminal penalties and has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others. Although a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors exist to protect certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors for this statute are narrow, and practices that involve compensation intended to induce prescriptions, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not always meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection. A person or entity need not have knowledge of the statutes or the specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs; furthermore, in several states, these statutes and regulations apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s product from reimbursement under government programs, debarment, criminal fines, and imprisonment. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have enacted similar anti-kickback, fraud and abuse laws and regulations.
The federal civil False Claims Act imposes civil liability and penalties on individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, as well as for making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Claims may be pursued by whistleblowers through qui tam actions, even if the government declines to intervene. Intent to deceive is not necessary to establish civil liability, which may be predicated on reckless disregard for the truth. The federal government continues to use the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in investigations against pharmaceutical and health care companies. These investigations have involved, for example, allegations of providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the free product, as well as the promotion of products for unapproved uses and reporting false pricing information. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute may also be grounds for civil False Claims Act actions. Potential liability under the federal False Claims Act includes treble damages and significant per claim penalties, currently set at $10,957 to $21,916 (as adjusted for inflation) per false claim. The criminal federal False Claims Act imposes criminal fines or imprisonment against individuals or entities who make or present a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false fictitious or fraudulent. Conviction or civil judgment for violation of the False Claims Act can also result in debarment from government contracting and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
The Affordable Care Act included a provision requiring certain providers and suppliers of items and services to Federal Health Care Programs to report and return overpayments within sixty days after they are “identified” (the “Overpayment Statute”). In 2014 and 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, released regulatory guidance (in the form of a final rule) to Medicare providers, suppliers and managed care and prescription drug plans regarding how to comply with the Overpayment Statute. Although these Medicare providers, suppliers and plans have faced federal False Claims Act liability since 2010 for failures to comply with the Overpayment Statute, these final rules interpreting the Overpayment Statute provide guidance regarding how to comply with applicable obligations, and guidance to government regulators and enforcement authorities regarding monitoring 
43

and prosecuting suspected violations. These final rules are not directly applicable to manufacturers, but may impact their customers and potential customers who are Medicare providers, suppliers, and plans.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value made to covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests. Payments made to physicians and certain research institutions for clinical trials are included within the ambit of this law. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required annually to report and disclose payments and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Such information is made publicly available by CMS in a searchable format, with data collected in each calendar year published the following June. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties, with increased penalties for “knowing failures,” for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. If not preempted by this federal law, several states currently require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to healthcare professionals in those states. Depending on the state, legislation may prohibit various other marketing related activities, or require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, certain states, such as California, Nevada, Connecticut and Massachusetts, require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and several other states are considering similar proposals. Manufacturers that fail to comply with these state laws can face civil penalties.
Statutory requirements to disclose publicly payments made to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations have also been enacted in certain European Union member states. In addition, self-regulatory bodies of the pharmaceuticals industry, such as the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, or EFPIA, have published codes of conduct to which its members have agreed to abide to, that require the public disclosure of payments made to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations. In some countries (including France, Denmark and Portugal) such requirements are enforceable by law.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, in connection with the delivery or payment for health care benefits, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. Additionally, the ACA amended the intent requirement of certain of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation.
HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and similar state laws, also impose obligations on certain entities with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of certain individually identifiable health information, known as protected health information. Among other things, HITECH and implementing regulations makes HIPAA's security and certain privacy standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as persons or organizations of covered entities, other than members of the covered entity’s workforce, that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. HITECH also strengthened the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and individuals, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney's fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Civil and criminal penalties include up to $50,000 per violation plus a criminal fine of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison. In addition, other federal and state laws may regulate the privacy and security of information that we maintain, many of which may differ from each other in significant ways and may not be preempted by HIPAA,
Any continuing efforts by the Trump Administration and the U.S. Congress to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act, could have an impact on fraud and abuse provisions and other requirements, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, that were authorized and enacted under the Affordable Care Act.
The foregoing discussion should be read in conjunction with the information appearing under “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our relationships with customers, healthcare providers and professionals, patients, patient organizations, and third-party payors are or will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.” which contains important information regarding some of the risks to our business arising as a result fraud and abuse laws.
