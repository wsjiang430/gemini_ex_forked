Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 
The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation on January 31, 2002. On March 14, 2013, the Company changed its corporate name from Lapis Technologies, Inc. to Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc. On July 13, 2018, following the sale of its former subsidiary Enertec Systems Ltd., the Company changed its name from Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc. to MICT, Inc. The Company’s shares have been listed for trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, since April 29, 2013.
 
The Company operates primarily through an Israel-based subsidiary, Micronet Ltd., or Micronet, in which the Company previously had a majority ownership interest that has since been diluted to a minority ownership interest.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we held 49.89% of Micronet’s issued and outstanding shares, and together with an irrevocable proxy in our benefit from Mr. David Lucatz, our President and Chief Executive Officer, we held 50.07% of the voting interest in Micronet as of such date. On February 24, 2019, Micronet closed a public equity offering on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, or the TASE, and as a result of this offering, our ownership interest in Micronet was diluted from 49.89% to 33.88%. On February 24, 2019, Mr. David Lucatz, our President and Chief Executive Officer, executed a new irrevocable proxy assigning his voting power over 1,980,000 shares of Micronet for our benefit. As a result, our current voting interest in Micronet stands at 39.53% of the issued and outstanding shares of Micronet.  The decrease in our voting interest in Micronet will result in a deconsolidation of Micronet and, therefore, from February 24, 2019, we will account for the investment in Micronet in accordance with the equity method. The Company is still assessing the gain/loss that will be recorded as a result thereof and our results in future periods might change significantly as a result of the move to the equity method. 
 
Micronet operates in the growing commercial Mobile Resource Management, or MRM, market. Micronet through both its Israeli and U.S. operational offices designs, develops, manufactures and sells rugged mobile computing devices that provide fleet operators and field workforces with computing solutions in challenging work environments. Micronet’s vehicle portable tablets increase workforce productivity and enhance corporate efficiency by offering computing power and communication capabilities that provide fleet operators with visibility into vehicle location, fuel usage, speed and mileage. Furthermore, users are able to manage the drivers in various aspects, such as: driver identification, reporting hours worked, customer/organization working procedures and protocols, route management and navigation based on tasks and time schedule. End users may also receive real time messages for various services such as pickup and delivery, repair and maintenance, status reports, alerts, notices relating to the start and ending of work, digital forms, issuing and printing of invoices and payments. Through its SmartHub product, Micronet provides its consumers with services such as driver recognition, identifying and preventing driver fatigue, recognizing driver behavior, preventive maintenance, fuel efficiency and an advanced driver assistance system. In addition, Micronet provides third party telematics service providers, or TSPs, a platform to offer services such as “Hours of Service.” Micronet previously commenced and continues to evaluate integration with other TSPs.
 
Micronet’s customers consist primarily of application service providers, or ASPs, and solution providers specializing in the MRM market. These companies sell Micronet’s products as part of their MRM systems and solutions. Currently, Micronet does not sell directly to end users. Micronet customers are generally MRM solution and service providers, ASP providers in the transportation market, including long haul, local fleets’ student transportation (yellow busses) and fleet and field management systems for construction and heavy equipment. Micronet products are used by customers worldwide.
 
Micronet operates and conducts its business in the U.S. market through Micronet Inc., a fully owned subsidiary located in Utah. The Micronet U.S.-based business, operations and facilities include manufacturing and technical support infrastructure as well as sales and marketing capabilities which allow Micronet to continue and expand into the U.S. market and support its existing U.S.-based customers, all with further accessibility and presence to local fleets and local MRM service providers.

Sales and Marketing
 
Micronet’s customers consist primarily of TSPs and VARs specializing in the fleet and MRM markets. Currently, Micronet does not sell directly to the end users’ fleets. Micronet's customers are generally leading TSPs and service providers of commercial solutions that integrate a wide range of positioning technologies and computing fleet communications in the MRM market.
 
Micronet products are used by customers worldwide. The United States currently constitutes Micronet’s largest market, representing approximately 76% of Micronet’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 78% for the year ended December 31, 2017. In any given year, a single Micronet customer may account for a significant portion of Micronet’s revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Micronet’s three largest customers represented approximately individually 38%, 17%, 1%, of Micronet’s revenues, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the Micronet sales team consisted of seven dedicated sales managers including a back office team.
 
Research and Development
 
In order to keep up with the rapid technology evolution and the changing needs of the markets in which it operates, Micronet continues to focus on its innovation and the development of new products and technologies, by continuing to make the necessary investments in research and development.
 
Micronet upgrades and enhances its existing products on an on-going basis, including based on input from its clients and partners and from other sources. Enhancements include the addition of capabilities, improvement of product functionality and performance, and adding features to the existing hardware in order to offer customers a variety of solutions, while continuing to decrease costs to enhance its profit margins and create a competitive market pricing position.
 
In addition, Micronet seeks to design and manage product life cycles through a controlled and structured process. It involves customers and industry experts from its target markets in the definition and refinement of its product development. Product development emphasis is placed on meeting industry standards, ease of integration, cost reduction, design-for manufacturability, versatility and innovation, and quality and reliability.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Micronet spent NIS 7.1 million (approximately $2 million) and NIS 7 million (approximately $1.9 million), respectively, on research and development activities. Micronet uses its own resources to finances its research and development activities and none of the cost of such activities is borne by its customers.
 
To date, Micronet has received an aggregate of NIS 5.6 million (approximately $1.4 million) from the Israeli Innovation Authority, or IIA, under these three grants. Micronet is obligated to pay royalties to the IIA amounting to 3%-3.5% of the sales of the products and other related revenues generated from such projects linked to the dollar plus Libor interest rate.
 
Competition
 
Micronet operates in a highly competitive industry. Further, during the last few years, competition in the field of mobile computers has significantly increased with the mass entrance and introduction to the market of smart phones, tablets, and laptops, as well as various GPS-based hand-held devices featuring additional functionalities.
 
The direct competition in the field of dedicated laptops for the management of fleets is held primarily with OEMs, which provide products that enable application development and functional integration according to customer needs. To the best of Micronet’s knowledge, there are half a dozen such direct competitors operating in Micronet’s main geographical target market, North America. Most of the competitors are private companies or those who do not publish sales data specific to their products in this field, so the company does not have specific information to estimate its relative share in the market or to directly compare its size or position relative to a particular competitor.
 
Micronet believes that there are several products in the market that compete with its products including mobile devices, which differ among themselves in various parameters. Micronet estimates that its products are competitive in the market and offer customers a beneficial solution in view of the advanced technology implemented in such products. Micronet’s competitive position is also effected by its market positioning and the reputation it has acquired over the years through its dealings with a wide range of customers and products. Micronet estimates that its Android open operating platform based products provides for a technological edge in the market over a number of competitors, which still base their devices on their internal proprietary operating systems. These systems are closed systems and with the transformation of the world to the use of the Android system becoming the dominant operating system among customers, such vendors may be in an inferior position. Micronet's products align with the trend of the increasing demand in the market for Android-based products, which enable each customer to develop its applications and functionalization according to its needs.
 
A large number of Micronet’s competitors are private companies or companies that do not disclose their sales or other financial information, making it difficult to estimate Micronet’s market share and position in the market. Micronet believes that its most significant competitors include the following: CalAmp Corp., Mobile Devices (France), TomTom (Holland), Garmin USA, Inc. and Samsung. In addition, some service providers consider the use of their in-house development capabilities for the supply of their internal needs for mobile devices.
 
This intensely competitive industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and changes in customer requirements. In order to maintain its competitive strength, Micronet must continue to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and product features which are in line with the technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers.
 
Micronet’s management believes its strongest competitive advantages are the durability of its products and reputation in the industry. Its competitive strengths include the following:
 

● | 30 years of field-proven experience, including engineering and manufacturing know-how;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Micronet currently operates via two facilities, the first located in Azur, Israel, near Tel Aviv, and the second located in Salt Lake City, Utah. These two operating facilities give Micronet additional manufacturing and marketing flexibility to serve the market’s needs, reduce its operational risk, improve its U.S. presence and provide management with additional tools to support the business.
 
Manufacturing
 
Micronet conducts its manufacturing activities mainly through third party subcontractors in Israel and outside of Israel and also using its own U.S. and Israel based facilities. Micronet operates an ISO 9001-2008 certified manufacturing facility.
 
During the past few years, with the exception of certain components purchased from subcontractors, Micronet has relied on itself to manufacture its products and solutions using its own facilities, capabilities and resources, which enable it to control and manage the manufacturing process.
 
However, Micronet has gradually begun utilizing overseas manufacturers and subcontractors for its new product offerings, in combination with its internal manufacturing facilities. As of December 31, 2018, as part of its strategy, Micronet is focused on its core competence, which includes research, development, marketing and support activities.
 
Accordingly with respect to its new product offerings, Micronet has shifted significant parts of its manufacturing activities from its Israeli manufacturing activity to trusted third party manufacturers and subcontractors in and outside of Israel, while increasing its operational flexibility and reducing its fixed costs attributed to the production lines. In addition, Micronet is utilizing overseas manufacturing in conjunction with its internal assembly test lines in Salt Lake City for final provisioning and shipping.
 
Following certain enhancements in its manufacturing and production capabilities, Micronet has manufacturing capacity and has the ability to meet current or foreseeable manufacturing needs without making any significant investments. Implemented enhancements include:
 

● | upgraded production and assembly line and purchased new machinery with significant higher component implementation scale;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased factory facilities and upgraded various infrastructures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | entered into agreements with subcontractors in the field that operate additional manufacturing facilities, and have significant procurement and manufacturing capabilities and resources that are available to Micronet; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | certified subcontractors to perform manufacturing process to ensure flexible manufacturing infrastructures and deployment that can be used for disaster recovery scenarios or rapid increase in production needs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If additional manufacturing resources are needed to meet increased demand for Micronet’s products, manufacturing capacity can be enhanced by adjusting the outsourcing manufacturing processes, recruiting and training additional employees, adding shifts to the labor cycles.
 
Intellectual Property

Proprietary rights are important to Micronet’s business because its ability to remain competitive in the market is dependent to a significant degree on its proprietary solutions and products and the technology on which they are based. To protect its proprietary rights, Micronet primarily relies on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, internal know-how, and agreements with third parties, such as license agreements. In addition, Micronet employs internal controls such as the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. Micronet believes its proprietary technology incorporates processes, know-how, methods, algorithms, hardware and software that are the result of more than 20 years of experience and in-house expertise and thus are not easily copied. There is a significant amount of litigation with respect to intellectual property in the industry in which Micronet operates. Micronet has not, to date, been the subject of any claims or proceedings with regards to infringement of third party’s proprietary rights and it believes that its products, solutions and services do not violate or infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. In light of the strong competition in the industry and the innovative solutions and technologies incorporated by Micronet into its recent products, Micronet has been exploring the use of patent applications and is in the process of filing certain patent applications related to its products in the United States, solutions and proprietary technologies. These patents, to the extent granted, are expected to assist Micronet to maintain its technological and competitive position in the market. Micronet’s management, together with its research and development team, monitor closely and continuously all technological developments in the market. Micronet considers and evaluates on an ad hoc basis whether technology and proprietary assets should be acquired through independent in-house development or through the purchase of patents or other technological licenses. Where the purchase of third party proprietary technology, solution or products is required and can be of advantage to its business, Micronet would purchase a license and pay appropriate royalties or license fees. Micronet currently has all third-party licenses or is in the process of acquiring licenses that it believes are necessary to maintain and develop its business.
Government Regulation
 
Micronet’s business is subject to certain international standards such as U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, Part 15B, FCC ID, European Conformity, or CE, and Restriction of Hazardous Substances, or RoHS, which define compatibility of interface and telecommunications standards to those implemented in Europe by the European Commission and in the United States by the FCC. Its solutions and products also comply with the E-Mark European standard, which is the standard that defines the compatibility of interface and telecommunications to all appliances installed in and around an automobile.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 53 full-time employees (and as of March 28, 2019, the Company had approximately 46 full-time employees) and Micronet had approximately 49 full-time employees (as of March 28, 2019, Micronet had approximately 41 full-time employees). Of these employees, 12 were employed in manufacturing positions, and the remainder were employed in sales, research and development, management and administrative positions. Our and Micronet’s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and both we and Micronet have never experienced a work stoppage. Both we and Micronet, to the best of our knowledge, have good and sustainable relations with our and its employees, respectively. Israeli labor laws and regulations apply to all employees based in Israel. The laws principally address matters such as paid vacation, paid sick days, length of the workday, payment for overtime and severance payments upon the retirement or death of an employee or termination of employment under specified circumstances. The severance payments may be funded, in whole or in part, through a managers’ insurance fund or a pension fund. The payments to the managers’ insurance fund or pension fund toward severance amount to 8.3% of wages. Furthermore, Israeli employees and employers are required to pay predetermined sums to the National Insurance Institute of Israel. Since January 1, 1995, these amounts also include payments for health insurance.
