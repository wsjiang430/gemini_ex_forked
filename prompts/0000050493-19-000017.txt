Item 1. BUSINESS    ﻿ General 
 ﻿
 Ingles Markets, Incorporated (“Ingles” or the “Company”), a leading supermarket chain in the southeast United States, operates 198 supermarkets in North Carolina (73), Georgia (66), South Carolina (36), Tennessee (21), Virginia (1) and Alabama (1). 
 ﻿
 The Company’s strategy is to locate its supermarkets primarily in suburban areas, small towns and neighborhood shopping centers.  The Company remodels, expands and relocates stores in these communities and builds stores in new locations to retain and grow its customer base while retaining a high level of customer service and convenience.  Ingles supermarkets offer customers a wide variety of nationally advertised food products, including grocery, meat and dairy products, produce, frozen foods and other perishables, and non-food products.  Non-food products include fuel centers, pharmacies, health and beauty care products and general merchandise.  The Company also offers quality private label items and locally-sourced items throughout its market areas.
 ﻿
 The Company believes that customer service and convenience, modern stores and competitive prices on a broad selection of quality merchandise are essential to developing and retaining a loyal customer base.  The Company has an ongoing renovation and expansion plan to add stores in its target market and modernize the appearance and layout of its existing stores.  The Company’s new and remodeled supermarkets provide an enhanced level of customer convenience in order to accommodate the lifestyle of today’s shoppers.  Design features of the Company’s modern stores focus on selling high-growth, high-margin products including perishable departments featuring local organic and home meal replacement items, in-store pharmacies, on-premises fuel centers, and an expanded selection of food and non-food items. 
 ﻿
 Substantially all of the Company’s stores are located within 280 miles of its warehouse and distribution facilities, near Asheville, North Carolina.  The Company operates 1.65 million square feet of warehouse and distribution facilities.  These facilities supply the company’s supermarkets with approximately 59% of the goods the Company sells.  The remaining 41% is purchased from third parties and is generally delivered directly to the stores.  The close proximity of the Company’s purchasing and distribution operations to its stores facilitates the timely distribution of consistently high quality perishable and non-perishable items. 
 ﻿
 To further ensure product quality, the Company also owns and operates a milk processing and packaging plant that supplies approximately 81% of the milk products sold by the Company’s supermarkets as well as a variety of organic milk, fruit juices and bottled water products.  In addition, the milk processing and packaging plant sells approximately 73% of its products to other retailers, food service distributors and grocery warehouses in 16 states, which provides the Company with an additional source of revenue.  
 ﻿
 The Company owns 162 of its supermarkets, either in free-standing stores or as the anchor tenant in an owned shopping center.  The Company also owns 21 undeveloped sites suitable for a free-standing store or development by the Company or a third party.  The Company’s owned real estate is generally located in the same geographic region as its supermarkets.  During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the Company purchased a total of four shopping centers which contained Ingles stores that had been leased from third-party landlords.
 ﻿
 The Company was founded by Robert P. Ingle, who served as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer until his death in March 2011.  His son, Robert P. Ingle II is Chairman of the Board and remains actively involved in the Company’s daily operations.
 ﻿
 As of September 28, 2019, Mr. Ingle II owned beneficially (as defined by the Exchange Act) approximately 76% of the combined voting power and 29% of the total number of shares of the Company’s outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock (in each case including stock held by the Company’s Investment/Profit Sharing Plan and Trust of which Mr. Ingle II serves as one of the trustees).  The Company became a publicly traded company in September 1987.  The Company’s Class A Common Stock is traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “IMKTA.”  The Company’s Class B Common Stock is not publicly traded.
 ﻿
 The Company was incorporated in 1965 under the laws of the State of North Carolina.  Its principal mailing address is P.O. Box 6676, Asheville, North Carolina 28816, and its telephone number is 828-669-2941.  The Company’s website is www.ingles-markets.com.  Information on the Company’s website is not a part of and is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments and supplements to these reports are available on the Company’s website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 The Company believes that today’s supermarket customers are focused on convenience, quality and value in an attractive store environment. As a result, the Company’s shopping experience combines a high level of customer service, convenience-oriented quality product offerings and low overall pricing. The Company’s modern stores provide products and services such as home meal replacement items, delicatessens, bakeries, floral departments, greeting cards and broad selections of local organic, beverage and health-related items. At September 28, 2019, the Company operated 108 pharmacies and 104 fuel stations.  The Company plans to continue to incorporate these departments in substantially all future new and remodeled stores.  The Company trains its employees to provide friendly service and to actively address the needs of customers. These employees reinforce the Company’s distinctive service-oriented image.

  ﻿
 Merchandising 
 ﻿
 The Company’s merchandising strategy is designed to create a comprehensive and satisfying shopping experience that blends value and customer service with variety, quality and convenience.  Management believes that this strategy fosters a loyal customer base by establishing a reputation for providing high quality products and a variety of specialty departments. 
 ﻿
 The Company’s stores carry broad selections of quality meats, produce and other perishables.  The Company offers a wide variety of fresh and non-perishable organic products, including organic milk produced by the Company’s fluid dairy plant.  The Company’s market areas contain numerous providers of quality local products, which is in line with current customer preferences for goods produced where they live.  Management believes that supermarkets offering a broad array of products and time-saving services are perceived by customers as part of a solution to today’s lifestyle demands.  Accordingly, a principal component of the Company’s merchandising strategy is to design stores that enhance the shopping experience.  The Company operates fuel stations at 104 of its store locations.  
 ﻿
 A selection of prepared foods and home meal replacements are featured throughout Ingles’ deli, bakery, produce and meat departments to provide customers with easy meal alternatives that they can eat at home or in the store.  Many stores offer daily selections of home meal replacement items, such as rotisserie chicken and pork, international foods, fried chicken and other entrees, sandwiches, pre-packaged salads, sushi, cut fruit and prepared fresh vegetables.  The bakery offers an expanded selection of baked goods and self-service selections.  Ingles bakes most of its items on site, including bread baked daily, cakes made to order in various sizes, donuts and other pastries.  The deli offers salad, chicken wing and olive bars, an expanded offering of cheeses, gourmet items and home meal replacement items.  The Company also provides its customers with an expanded selection of frozen food items (including organics) to meet the increasing demands of its customers. 
 ﻿
 Ingles intends to continue to increase sales of its private label brands, which typically carry higher margins than comparable branded products.  Ingles’ private labels cover a broad range of products throughout the store, such as milk, bread, organic products, soft drinks and canned goods.  In addition to increasing margins, Ingles believes that private label sales help promote customer loyalty and provide a value-priced alternative to national brands.   
 ﻿
 The Company seeks to maintain a reputation for providing friendly service, quality merchandise and customer value and for its commitment to locally-sourced product and community involvement.  The Company employs various advertising and promotional strategies to reinforce the quality and value of its products.  The Company promotes these attributes using traditional advertising vehicles including radio, television, direct mail and newspapers, as well as electronic and social media.  The Ingles Advantage Card is designed to foster customer loyalty by providing information to better understand the Company’s customers’ shopping patterns.  The Ingles Advantage Card provides customers with special discounts throughout the Company’s stores and fuel stations. 
 ﻿
 Purchasing and Distribution 
 ﻿
 The Company currently supplies approximately 59% of its supermarkets’ inventory requirements from its modern warehouse and distribution facilities.  The Company has 1.65 million square feet of office, warehouse and distribution facilities at its headquarters near Asheville, North Carolina.  The Company believes that its warehouse and distribution facilities contain sufficient capacity for the continued expansion of its store base for the foreseeable future. 
 ﻿
 The Company’s centrally managed purchasing and distribution operations provide several advantages, including the ability to negotiate and reduce the cost of merchandise, decrease overhead costs and better manage its inventory at both the warehouse and store level.  From time to time, the Company engages in advance purchasing on high-turnover inventory items to take advantage of special prices offered by manufacturers for limited periods, or to ensure adequate product supply during tight distribution market conditions. 
 ﻿
 The remaining 41% of the Company’s inventory requirements, primarily beverages, gasoline, bread and snack foods, are supplied directly to the Company’s supermarkets by local distributors and manufacturers. 


 

6

﻿
 Goods from the warehouse and distribution facilities and the milk processing and packaging plant are distributed to the Company’s stores by a fleet of 193 tractors and 799 trailers that the Company owns, operates and maintains.  The Company invests on an ongoing basis in the maintenance, upgrade and replacement of its tractor and trailer fleet.  The Company also operates truck servicing and fuel storage facilities at its warehouse and distribution facilities.  The Company reduces its overall distribution costs by capitalizing on back-haul opportunities (contracting to transport merchandise on trucks that would otherwise be empty).
 ﻿
 The Company receives product recall information from various subscription, government and vendor sources.  Upon receipt of recall information, the Company immediately contacts each of its stores to have the recalled product removed from the shelves, and disposes of the product as instructed.  The Company may also use social media to communicate product recall information to the public.  The Company has a policy of refunding and/or replacing any goods returned by customers.  The details of this policy are posted inside each of the Company’s stores.  
 ﻿
 Store Development, Expansion and Remodeling
 ﻿
 The Company believes that the appearance and design of its stores are integral components of its customers’ shopping experience and aims to develop one of the most modern supermarket chains in the industry.  The ongoing modernization of the Company’s store base involves (i) the construction of new stores with continuously updated designs, and (ii) the replacement, remodeling or expansion of existing stores.  The Company’s goal is to maintain clean, well-lit stores with attractive architectural and display features that enhance the image of its stores as catering to the changing lifestyle needs of quality-conscious consumers who demand increasingly diverse product offerings.  The construction of new stores by independent contractors is closely monitored and controlled by the Company.  Recently, the Company has had a greater number of circumstances where an existing store was closed in order to build a new store building on the same site that reflects the Company’s current marketing strategies. 
 ﻿
 The Company renovates and remodels stores in order to increase customer traffic and sales, respond to existing customer demand, compete effectively against new stores opened by competitors and support its quality image merchandising strategy.  The Company decides to complete a remodel of an existing store based on its evaluation of the competitive landscape of the local marketplace.  A remodel or expansion provides the quality of facilities and product offerings identical to that of a new store, capitalizing upon the existing customer base.  The Company retains the existing customer base by keeping the store in operation during the entire remodeling process.  The Company may elect to relocate, rather than remodel, certain stores where relocation provides a more convenient location for its customers. 
 ﻿
 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the Company’s new store development and store remodeling activities and the effect this program has had on the average size of its stores: 
 ﻿

  ﻿

(1) | Excludes new stores opened to replace existing stores.
----+-------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The Company’s ability to open new stores is subject to many factors, including the acquisition of satisfactory sites and may be limited by zoning and other governmental regulation.  In addition, the Company’s expansion, remodeling and replacement plans are continually reviewed and are subject to change.  See the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section included in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding the Company’s capital expenditures. 
 ﻿
 Competition 
 ﻿
 The supermarket industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. The degree of competition the Company’s stores encounter varies by location, primarily based on the size of the community in which the store is located and its proximity to other communities.  The Company’s principal competitors are, in alphabetical order, Aldi, Inc., Bi-Lo, LLC., Earth Fare, Inc, Food City (K-VA-T Food Stores, Inc.), Food Lion (Koninlijke Ahold Delhaize America N.V..), The Fresh Market, Inc., Harris Teeter (owned by The Kroger Co.), The Kroger Co., Lidl (Lidl Stiftung & Co. KG), Publix Super Markets, Inc., Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc., Target Corporation, Whole Foods Market, and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  Increasingly over the last few years, competition for 

 

7

consumers’ food dollars has intensified due to the addition of, or increase in, food sections by many types of retailers (physical and online) and by restaurants. 
 ﻿
 Supermarket chains generally compete on the basis of location, quality of products, service, price, convenience, product variety and store condition. 
 ﻿
 The Company believes its competitive advantages include convenient locations, the quality of service it provides its customers, competitive pricing, product variety, quality and a pleasant shopping environment, which is enhanced by its ongoing modernization program. 
 ﻿
 By concentrating its operations within a relatively small geographic region, the Company is also positioned to more carefully monitor its markets, and the needs of its customers within those markets.  The Company’s senior executives live and work in the Company’s operating region, thereby allowing management to quickly identify changes in needs and customer preference.  Because of the Company’s size, store managers have direct access to corporate management and are able to receive quick decisions regarding requested changes in operations.  The Company can then move quickly to make adjustments in its business in response to changes in the market and customer needs.  
 ﻿
 The Company’s management monitors competitive activity and regularly reviews and periodically adjusts the Company’s marketing and business strategies as management deems appropriate in light of existing conditions in the Company’s region.  The Company’s ability to remain competitive in its changing markets will depend in part on its ability to pursue its expansion and renovation programs and its response to remodeling and new store openings by its competitors. 
 ﻿
 Seasonality 
 ﻿
 Sales in the grocery segment of the Company’s business are subject to a slight seasonal variance due to holiday related sales and due to sales in areas where seasonal homes are located. Sales are traditionally higher in the Company’s first fiscal quarter due to the inclusion of sales related to Thanksgiving and Christmas.  The Company’s second fiscal quarter traditionally has the lowest sales of the year, unless Easter falls in that quarter.  In the third and fourth quarters, sales are affected by the return of customers to seasonal homes in the Company’s market area.  The Company’s fluid dairy operations have a slight seasonal variation to the extent of its sales into the grocery industry.  The Company’s real estate operations are not subject to seasonal variations. 
 ﻿
 Employees and Labor Relations 
 ﻿
 At September 28, 2019, the Company had approximately 27,000 non-union employees, of which 92% were supermarket personnel.  Approximately 62% of these employees work on a part-time basis.  Management considers employee relations to be good.  The Company values its employees and believes that employee loyalty and enthusiasm are key elements of its operating performance.  Recently, competition for labor has been more intense resulting in higher costs to attract and retain associates.  The Company has responded by increasing resources devoted to employee recruitment and retention, and has expanded the ways in which it markets itself to prospective employees.
 ﻿
 Trademarks and Licenses 
 ﻿
 The Company employs various trademarks and service marks in its business, the most important of which are its own “Laura Lynn” and “Harvest Farms” private label trademarks, “The Ingles Advantage” service mark, and the “Ingles” service mark. These service marks and the trademarks are federally registered in the United States pursuant to applicable intellectual property laws and are the property of Ingles.  The Company believes it has all material licenses and permits necessary to conduct its business. 
 ﻿
 The current expiration dates for significant trade and service marks are as follows: “Ingles” – December 9, 2025; “Laura Lynn” – March 13, 2024; “Harvest Farms” – August 5, 2024; and “The Ingles Advantage” – August 30, 2025. Each registration may be renewed for an additional ten-year term prior to its expiration.  The Company intends to file all renewals timely.  Each of the Company’s trademark license agreements has a one year term which, with respect to one license, is automatically renewed annually, unless the owner of the trademark provides notice of termination prior to the expiration date and, with respect to the other licenses, are renewed periodically by letter from the licensor.  The Company currently has three pending applications for additional trademarks or service marks.
 ﻿
 Environmental Matters 
 ﻿
 Under applicable environmental laws, the Company may be responsible for remediation of environmental conditions and may be subject to associated liabilities relating to its stores and other buildings and the land on which such stores and other buildings are situated (including responsibility and liability related to its operation of its gas stations and the storage of gasoline in underground storage tanks), regardless of whether the Company leases or owns the stores, other buildings or land in question and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by the Company or by a prior owner or tenant.  The presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to properly remediate such contaminated property, may adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell or rent such real property or to borrow using such real property as collateral.  The Company typically conducts an environmental review prior to acquiring or leasing new stores, other buildings or raw land. 


 

8

﻿
 Federal, state and local governments could enact laws or regulations concerning environmental matters that affect the Company’s operations or facilities or increase the cost of producing or distributing the Company’s products.  The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations, and in the past has conducted its operations, in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws.  The Company, however, cannot predict the environmental liabilities that may result from legislation or regulations adopted in the future, the effect of which could be retroactive.  Nor can the Company predict how existing or future laws and regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist at its facilities or at other properties where the Company or its predecessors have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. 
 ﻿
 The Company strives to employ sound environmental operating policies, including recycling packaging, recycling wooden pallets, and re-circulating some water used in its car washes.  The Company offers reusable shopping bags to its customers and will pack groceries in bags brought in by its customers.  The Company’s store modernization plans include energy efficient lighting and refrigeration equipment. 
 ﻿
 Government Regulation 
 ﻿
 The Company is subject to regulation by a variety of governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration and other federal, state and local agencies.  The Company’s stores are also subject to local laws regarding zoning, land use and the sale of alcoholic beverages.  The Company believes that its locations are in material compliance with such laws and regulations.
