ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

COMPANY OVERVIEW
We are an internally managed mortgage real estate investment trust, or mortgage REIT, which primarily invests in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) on a leveraged basis. We finance our investments principally with borrowings under repurchase agreements. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term that are reflective of a leveraged, high quality fixed income portfolio with a focus on capital preservation. We seek to provide returns to our shareholders primarily through the payment of regular dividends and also potentially through capital appreciation of our investments. 
Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “DX”. We have two series of preferred stock outstanding, our 8.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock") which is traded on the NYSE under the symbol "DXPRA", and our 7.625% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the "Series B Preferred Stock") which is traded on the NYSE under the symbol "DXPRB". 

Our investments consist principally of Agency and non-Agency MBS including residential MBS (“RMBS”), commercial MBS (“CMBS”) and CMBS interest-only (“IO”) securities. Agency MBS have a guaranty of principal payment by an agency of the U.S. government or a U.S. government-sponsored entity (“GSE”) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Non-Agency MBS are issued by non-governmental enterprises and do not have a guaranty of principal payment. CMBS IO securities in which we invest may be issued by a GSE or a non-governmental enterprise. We may also invest in debt securities issued by the United States Department of the Treasury (“the Treasury” and such securities, “U.S. Treasuries”).
Investment Strategy

Our investment strategy and the allocation of our capital to a particular sector or investment is driven by a “top-down” framework that focuses on the expected risk-adjusted outcome of any investment. Key points of this framework include the following:

• | understanding macroeconomic conditions including the current state of the U.S. and global economies;


• | understanding the regulatory environment, competition for assets, and the terms and availability of financing;


• | sector analysis including understanding absolute returns, relative returns and risk-adjusted returns;


• | security and financing analysis including sensitivity analysis on credit, interest rate volatility, and market value risk; and


• | managing performance and inherent portfolio risks, including but not limited to interest rate, credit, prepayment, and liquidity risks.


In allocating our capital and executing our strategy, we seek to balance the risks of owning specific types of investments with the earnings opportunity on the investment. At various times during the last decade, we have allocated capital to a variety 
 1

of investments including adjustable-rate and fixed-rate Agency RMBS, Agency CMBS, investment grade and unrated non-Agency RMBS and CMBS, Agency and non-Agency CMBS IO, and residual interests in securitized mortgage loans. Our investments in non-Agency MBS are generally higher quality senior or mezzanine classes (typically rated 'A' or better by one or more of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) because they are typically more liquid (i.e., they are more easily converted into cash either through sales or pledges as collateral for repurchase agreement borrowings) and have less exposure to credit losses than lower-rated non-Agency MBS. We regularly review our existing operations to determine whether our investment strategy or business model should change, including through capital reallocation, changing our targeted investments, and shifting our risk position.
RMBS. Substantially all of our investments in RMBS as of December 31, 2018 were Agency issued securities collateralized primarily by fixed-rate single-family mortgage loans. The remainder of our RMBS portfolio is collateralized by adjustable-rate mortgage loans (“ARMs”), which have interest rates that generally adjust at least annually to an increment over a specified interest rate index, and hybrid ARMs, which are loans that have a fixed rate of interest for a specified period (typically three to ten years) and then adjust their interest rate at least annually to an increment over a specified interest rate index (primarily one-year LIBOR). 
We also purchase to-be-announced securities (“TBAs” or “TBA securities”) as a means of investing in non-specified fixed-rate Agency RMBS. A TBA security is a forward contract (“TBA contract”) for the purchase (“long position”) or sale (“short position”) of a fixed-rate Agency MBS at a predetermined price with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of collateral, but the particular Agency securities to be delivered are not identified until shortly before the settlement date. Our TBA purchases are financed by executing a series of transactions which effectively delay the settlement of a forward purchase of a non-specified Agency RMBS by entering into an offsetting TBA short position, net settling the paired-off positions in cash, and simultaneously entering into an identical TBA long position with a later settlement date. These net long TBA positions are referred to as “dollar roll positions”, and we view them as economically equivalent to investing in and financing Agency RMBS using short-term repurchase agreements. TBAs purchased for a forward settlement month are generally priced at a discount relative to TBAs sold for settlement in the current month. This discount, often referred to as “drop income”, represents the economic equivalent of net interest income (interest income less implied financing cost) on the underlying Agency security from trade date to settlement date. We account for TBAs as derivative instruments because we cannot assert that it is probable at inception and throughout the term of an individual TBA transaction that its settlement will result in physical delivery of the underlying Agency RMBS, or the individual TBA transaction will not settle in the shortest period possible. 
CMBS. Substantially all of our CMBS investments as of December 31, 2018 were fixed-rate Agency-issued securities backed by multifamily housing loans. Loans underlying CMBS are generally fixed-rate, mature in eight to eighteen years, have amortization terms of up to 30 years, and are geographically dispersed. These loans typically have some form of prepayment protection provisions (such as prepayment lock-out) or prepayment compensation provisions (such as yield maintenance or prepayment penalty). Yield maintenance and prepayment penalty requirements are intended to create an economic disincentive for the loans to prepay. From time to time we have invested in non-Agency CMBS backed by loans on multifamily housing, office buildings, retail, hospitality, and health care properties.
CMBS IO. CMBS IO are interest-only securities issued as part of a CMBS securitization and represent the right to receive a portion of the monthly interest payments (but not principal cash flows) on the unpaid principal balance of the underlying pool of commercial mortgage loans. We invest in both Agency-issued and non-Agency issued CMBS IO. The loans collateralizing CMBS IO pools are very similar in composition to the pools of loans that collateralize CMBS as discussed above. Since CMBS IO securities have no principal associated with them, the interest payments received are based on the unpaid principal balance of the underlying pool of mortgage loans, which is often referred to as the notional amount. Most loans in these securities have some form of prepayment protection from early repayment including absolute loan prepayment lock-outs, loan prepayment penalties, or yield maintenance requirements similar to those typical for CMBS described above. There are no prepayment protections, however, if the loan defaults and is partially or wholly repaid earlier because of loss mitigation actions taken by the underlying loan servicer, and therefore yields on CMBS IO investments are dependent upon the underlying loan performance. Because Agency-issued MBS generally contain higher credit quality loans, Agency CMBS IO are expected to have a lower risk of default than non-Agency CMBS IO. Our CMBS IO investments are investment grade-rated with the majority rated ‘AAA’ by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.

The performance of our investment portfolio will depend on many factors including but not limited to interest rates, trends of interest rates, the steepness of interest rate curves, prepayment rates on our investments, demand for our investments, general market liquidity, and economic conditions and their impact on the credit performance of our investments. In addition, our business model may be impacted by other factors such as the state of the overall credit markets, which could impact the availability and costs of financing. See “Factors that Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition” below, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business" in Item 1A of Part I, and Item 7A of Part II, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Financing Strategy
We use leverage to enhance the returns on our invested capital by pledging our investments as collateral for borrowings primarily through the use of uncommitted repurchase agreements with major financial institutions and broker-dealers. We generally use the proceeds of these borrowings to acquire investment securities. The amount of leverage we utilize depends upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to general economic, political and financial market conditions; the actual and anticipated liquidity and price volatility of our assets; the gap between the duration of assets and liabilities, including hedges; the availability and cost of financing the assets; our opinion of the credit worthiness of financing counterparties; the health of the U.S. residential mortgage and housing markets; our outlook for the level, slope and volatility of interest rates; the credit quality of the loans underlying our investments; the rating assigned to securities; and our outlook for asset spreads. Repurchase agreements generally have original terms to maturity of overnight to six months, though in some instances we may enter into longer-dated maturities depending on market conditions. We pay interest on our repurchase agreement borrowings at a rate usually based on a spread to a short-term interest rate such as LIBOR and fixed for the term of the borrowing. Borrowings under these repurchase agreements are renewable at the discretion of our lenders and do not contain guaranteed roll-over terms.
Repurchase agreement financing is provided principally by major financial institutions and broker-dealers acting as financial intermediaries for money market funds and securities lenders that provide funds to the repurchase agreement markets. Repurchase agreement financing exposes us to counterparty risk to such financial intermediaries, principally related to the excess of our collateral pledged over the amount borrowed. We seek to mitigate this risk by diversifying our repurchase agreement lenders and limiting borrowings from lesser capitalized or lightly regulated counterparties. In limited instances, a money market fund or securities lender has directly provided funds to us without the involvement of a financial intermediary typically at a lower cost than we would incur borrowing from the financial intermediary. Borrowing directly from these sources also reduces our risk to the financial intermediaries. 
 Please refer to "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business" in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding significant risks related to repurchase agreement financing.
Hedging Strategy

We use derivative instruments to economically hedge our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates resulting from our ownership of primarily fixed-rate investments financed with short-term repurchase agreements. Changes in interest rates can impact net interest income, the market value of our investments, and book value per common share. In a period of rising interest rates, our earnings and cash flow may be negatively impacted by borrowing costs increasing faster than interest income from our assets, and our book value may decline as a result of declining market values of our MBS. As of December 31, 2018, we primarily utilized pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk. An interest rate swap is a contractual agreement between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed upon period based upon a notional amount. Under our pay-fixed interest rate swap agreements, we pay a fixed interest rate and receive a floating interest rate based on one or three-month LIBOR. We may from time to time also enter into “receive-fixed” interest rate swap agreements. Interest rate swap agreements with a forward starting date do not have an exchange of these interest costs until the effective date of such agreement. 
To help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the market value of our portfolio as well as our net interest earnings, we may at times enter into forward or futures contracts, including short securities, net short TBA positions, options, futures, swaps, caps, or similar instruments. During portions of 2018, we utilized net short TBA positions, Eurodollar futures, and U.S. Treasury futures to hedge interest rate risk.
 3

In conducting our hedging activities, we intend to comply with REIT and tax limitations on our hedging instruments which could limit our activities and the instruments that we may use. We also intend to enter into derivative contracts only with the counterparties that we believe have a strong credit rating to help mitigate the risk of counterparty default or insolvency.
Operating Policies and Risk Management
We invest and manage our capital pursuant to Operating Policies approved by our Board of Directors. Our Operating Policies set forth investment and risk limitations as they relate to the Company's investment activities and set parameters for the Company's investment and capital allocation decisions. They require that we manage our operations and investments to comply with various REIT limitations (as discussed further below in “Federal Income Tax Considerations”) and to avoid qualifying as an investment company as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") or as a commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act.
Our Operating Policies place limits on certain risks to which we are exposed, such as interest rate and convexity risk, earnings at risk, and shareholders’ equity at risk from changes in fair value of our investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates, prepayment rates, investment prices and spreads, and other items. As part of our risk management process, our Operating Policies require us to perform a variety of stress tests to model the effect of adverse market conditions on our investment portfolio value and our liquidity.
Our Operating Policies limit our investment in non-Agency MBS that are rated BBB+ or lower at the time of purchase by any of the nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations to $250 million in market value and limit our shareholders’ equity at risk to a maximum of $50 million. We also conduct our own independent evaluation of the credit risk on any non-Agency MBS, such that we do not rely solely on the security’s credit rating. In addition, our purchases of non-rated MBS in recent years have been shorter duration securities which we believe to have less credit risk than typical non-rated MBS. Our Operating Policies also set forth limits for the Company’s overall leverage.
Within the overall limits established by our Operating Policies, our investment and capital allocation decisions depend on prevailing market conditions and other factors and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different economic and capital market environments. The Board may adjust the Operating Policies of the Company from time to time based on macroeconomic expectations, market conditions, and risk tolerances. 
Factors that Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Our financial performance is driven by the performance of our investment portfolio and related financing and hedging activity. In assessing our financial performance, management primarily focuses on net interest income, net interest spread, net income, comprehensive income, book value per common share, and core net operating income to common shareholders (a non-GAAP measure) and total economic return (measured as dividends declared plus changes in book value). Our financial performance may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are related to or influenced by macroeconomic conditions, market volatility, geopolitical conditions, U.S. Federal Reserve policy, U.S. fiscal and regulatory policy, and foreign central bank and government policy. Other factors that may impact our financial performance include, but are not limited to, the absolute level of interest rates, the relative slope of interest rate curves, changes in interest rates and market expectations of future interest rates, actual and estimated future prepayment rates on our investments, supply of investments, competition for investments, economic conditions and their impact on the credit performance of our investments, and market required yields as reflected by market spreads. These factors are influenced by market forces beyond our control.
Our business model may also be impacted by the availability and cost of financing and the state of the overall credit markets. Reductions or limitations in the availability of financing for our investments could significantly impact our business or force us to sell assets, potentially at losses. Repurchase agreement lending markets have been stable for the last several years, but lending by larger U.S. domiciled banks has declined in recent years due to increased regulation and changes to regulatory capital requirements. Their repurchase market participation has been replaced by smaller independent broker dealers that are generally less regulated and by U.S. domiciled broker dealer subsidiaries of foreign financial institutions. It is uncertain how these relatively new participants will react during periods of market stress. Other factors that could also impact our business include changes in regulatory requirements, including requirements to qualify for registration under the 1940 Act, and REIT requirements.
 4

We believe that regulatory impacts on financial institutions, many of which are our trading and financing counterparties, pose a potential threat to the overall liquidity in the capital markets. In 2017, the Federal Reserve began curtailing its reinvestment of principal payments received on its Agency RMBS portfolio. Prices in Agency RMBS generally have not been significantly impacted by the reduction, however prices may be more significantly impacted as the amount of curtailment increases each successive quarter. Market liquidity of our investments and the financing markets could be negatively impacted if the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (or "FOMC") suddenly changes market expectations of the target Federal Funds Rate or takes other actions which have the effect of tightening monetary policy that are not anticipated by the market. And finally, there remains uncertainty as to the ultimate impact or outcome of certain regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), and restrictions on market-making activities of large U.S. financial institutions could result in reduced liquidity in times of market stress.
As discussed above, investing in mortgage-related securities (including on a leveraged basis) subjects us to many risks including interest rate risk, prepayment and reinvestment risk, credit risk, spread risk, and liquidity risk. Please refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" as well as Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of these factors and others that have the potential to impact our results of operations and financial condition.
From time to time, we also consider expanding our capital base as well as merger, acquisition or divestiture opportunities. We analyze and evaluate potential business opportunities that we identify or are presented to us, including possible merger, acquisition, or divestiture transactions, that might be a strategic fit for our investment strategy or asset allocation or otherwise maximize value for our shareholders. Pursuing such an opportunity or transaction could require us to issue additional equity or debt securities.
COMPETITION
The business models of mortgage REITs range from investing only in Agency MBS to investing substantially in non-investment grade MBS and originating and securitizing mortgage loans and investing in mortgage servicing rights. Some mortgage REITs will invest in RMBS and related investments only, some in CMBS and related investments only, and some in a mix. Each mortgage REIT will assume various types and degrees of risk in its investment strategy. In purchasing investments and obtaining financing, we compete with other mortgage REITs, broker dealers and investment banking firms, mutual funds, banks, hedge funds, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, governmental bodies, and other entities, many of which have greater financial resources and a lower cost of capital than we do. Increased competition in the market may reduce the available supply of investments and may drive prices of investments to unacceptable levels which would negatively impact our ability to earn an acceptable amount of income from these investments. Competition can also reduce the availability of borrowing capacity at our repurchase agreement counterparties as such capacity is not unlimited, and many of our repurchase agreement counterparties limit the amount of financing they offer to the mortgage REIT industry.
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
As a REIT, we are required to abide by certain requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). To retain our REIT status, the REIT rules generally require that we invest primarily in real estate-related assets, that our activities be passive rather than active and that we distribute annually to our shareholders substantially all of our taxable income, after certain deductions, including deductions for our tax net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward. We could be subject to income tax if we failed to satisfy those requirements. We use the calendar year for both tax and financial reporting purposes.
We may utilize our NOL carryforward to offset our taxable earnings after taking the REIT distribution requirements into account. As a result of our public offering of common stock in February 2012, we incurred an "ownership change" as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code. Because of this ownership change, the amount of the NOL carryforward that we may use each year is limited to approximately $13.5 million, and portions of this amount not utilized are accumulated and rolled forward to the following year. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) permits an NOL generated after December 31, 2017 to be carried forward indefinitely, but NOL carryforwards generated prior to that date are still subject to expiration 20 years after the 
 5

year in which they are created. The majority of our NOL carryforward will expire in 2020. The following table provides a rollforward of our NOL carryforward for the periods indicated:

 | NOL Available for Use | | Total NOL
As of December 31, 2015: | $ | 25,190 | | | $ | 89,775
NOL limitation release for the years ended: | | | 
December 31, 2016 | 13,451 | | | 
December 31, 2017 | 13,451 | | | 
December 31, 2018 | 13,451 | | | 
NOL used for the years ended: | | |

As of December 31, 2018 | $ | 65,543 | | | $ | 89,775

(1) Subject to completion of our 2018 federal income tax return.
There may be differences between taxable income and net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These differences primarily arise from timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and GAAP purposes. 
Failure to satisfy certain Code requirements could cause us to lose our status as a REIT. If we failed to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, we may be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates and would not receive deductions for dividends paid to shareholders. We could, however, utilize our NOL carryforward to offset all or part of our taxable income to the extent the NOL is available to us based on the limitations described above. If we lost or otherwise surrendered our status as a REIT, we could not elect REIT status again for five years. Several of our investments in securitized mortgage loans have ownership restrictions limiting their ownership to REITs. Therefore, if we fail to maintain our REIT status, we would have to sell these investments or otherwise provide for REIT ownership of these investments. In addition, many of our repurchase agreement lenders and interest rate swap counterparties require us to maintain our REIT status. If we were to lose our REIT status, these lenders would have the right to terminate any repurchase agreement borrowings and interest rate swaps outstanding at that time.
Qualification as a REIT
Qualification as a REIT requires that we satisfy a variety of tests relating to our income, assets, distributions and ownership. The significant tests are summarized below.
Sources of Income. To continue qualifying as a REIT, we must satisfy two distinct tests with respect to the sources of our income: the “75% income test” and the “95% income test.” The 75% income test requires that we derive at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) from certain real estate-related sources. In order to satisfy the 95% income test, 95% of our gross income for the taxable year must consist of either income that qualifies under the 75% income test or certain other types of passive income.
If we fail to meet either the 75% income test or the 95% income test, or both, in a taxable year, we might nonetheless continue to qualify as a REIT, if our failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and the nature and amounts of our items of gross income were properly disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). However, in such a case we would be required to pay a tax equal to 100% of any excess non-qualifying income.
Nature and Diversification of Assets. At the end of each calendar quarter, we must meet multiple asset tests. Under the “75% asset test”, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must represent cash or cash items (including receivables), government 
 6

securities or real estate assets. Under the “10% asset test,” we may not own more than 10% of the outstanding voting power or value of securities of any single non-governmental issuer, provided such securities do not qualify under the 75% asset test or relate to taxable REIT subsidiaries. Under the “5% asset test,” ownership of any stocks or securities that do not qualify under the 75% asset test must be limited, in respect of any single non-governmental issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of our total assets (excluding ownership of any taxable REIT subsidiaries).
If we inadvertently fail to satisfy one or more of the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter, such failure would not cause us to lose our REIT status, provided that (i) we satisfied all of the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the discrepancy between the values of our assets and the standards imposed by the asset tests either did not exist immediately after the acquisition of any particular asset or was not wholly or partially caused by such an acquisition. If the condition described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence was not satisfied, we still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose.
Ownership. In order to maintain our REIT status, we must not be deemed to be closely held and must have more than 100 shareholders. The closely held prohibition requires that not more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares be owned by five or fewer persons at any time during the last half of our taxable year. The "more than 100 shareholders" rule requires that we have at least 100 shareholders for 335 days of a twelve-month taxable year. If we failed to satisfy the ownership requirements, we would be subject to fines and be required to take curative action to meet the ownership requirements in order to maintain our REIT status.
TCJA
TCJA made significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to businesses and their owners, including REITs and their stockholders. Pursuant to this legislation, among other items, as of January 1, 2018, (1) the federal income tax rate applicable to corporations was reduced to 21%, (2) the highest marginal individual income tax rate was reduced to 37%, (3) the corporate alternative minimum tax was repealed and (4) the allowable NOL deduction for a given year was reduced to 80% of a corporation’s (including a REIT’s) pre-NOL deduction taxable income. In addition, under the TCJA, individuals, estates and trusts may deduct up to 20% of certain pass-through income, including ordinary REIT dividends that are not “capital gain dividends” or “qualified dividend income,” subject to certain limitations. For taxpayers qualifying for the full deduction, the effective maximum tax rate on ordinary REIT dividends is 29.6% (plus a 3.8% surtax on net investment income, if applicable). The maximum rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to certain foreign owners that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests was also reduced from 35% to 21%. The deductibility of net interest expense is limited for all businesses; however, certain businesses, including certain real estate businesses, may elect to not be subject to such limitations, in which case they would be required to depreciate their real property-related assets over longer depreciable lives. To the extent that a taxable REIT subsidiary has interest expense that exceeds its interest income, the net interest expense limitation could potentially apply to such taxable REIT subsidiary. The reduced corporate tax rate of 21% applies to our taxable REIT subsidiaries. The individual and collective impact of these changes on REITs and their security holders remains uncertain and may not become evident for some period. Prospective and current investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the TCJA on their investment.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we have 19 employees and our corporate office is located in Glen Allen, Virginia. None of our employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements, and we are not aware of any union organizing activity relating to our employees.
