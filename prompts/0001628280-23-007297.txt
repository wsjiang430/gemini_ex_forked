ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Foghorn is a clinical stage, precision therapeutics biotechnology company pioneering a new class of medicines that treat serious diseases by correcting abnormal gene expression through selectively targeting the chromatin regulatory system, an untapped opportunity for therapeutic intervention in oncology and in a wide spectrum of other diseases including virology, autoimmune diseases and neurology.
The chromatin regulatory system orchestrates gene expression—the turning on and off of genes—which is fundamental to how all our cells function. The chromatin regulatory system is implicated in approximately 50% of all cancers, and understanding how this system works could lead to an entirely new class of precision medicines. To our knowledge, we are the only company with the ability to study and target the chromatin regulatory system at scale, in context, and in an integrated way.
Our proprietary Gene Traffic Control® platform provides an integrated and mechanistic understanding of how the various components of the chromatin regulatory system interact, allowing us to identify, validate and potentially drug targets within this system. We have developed unique capabilities that have yielded new insights and scalability in drugging this new, previously untapped and promising area. 
Since our inception in 2015, our platform has generated a broad pipeline of more than 15 programs with two clinical-stage drug candidates currently in phase 1 development across multiple indications. We have discovered highly selective chemical matter for some of the most challenging targets in oncology including BRM, CBP, EP300 and ARID1B as well as other undisclosed targets. We believe our current pipeline has the potential to help more than 500,000 cancer patients. We take a small molecule modality agnostic approach to drugging targets which includes protein degraders, allosteric enzymatic inhibitors, and transcription factor disruptors. We are a biology first company which means we focus first on the underlying genetics and biology of a disease relevant target and then leverage the most appropriate drugging approach to impact the disease biology.
Our two clinical-stage candidates are being studied across multiple indications and are supported by compelling science and preclinical data. We are developing FHD-286, a selective, allosteric ATPase inhibitor with two separate Phase 1 studies in (i) metastatic uveal melanoma and (ii) relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”), and myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”). We expect initial clinical data for metastatic uveal melanoma in the first half of 2023. The relapsed and/or refractory AML and MDS study has been placed on full clinical hold by the FDA due to the observation of potential differentiation syndrome and potential linkages to grade 5 safety events. We are developing FHD-609, a targeted protein degrader, and are currently enrolling a Phase 1 study in synovial sarcoma and SMARCB1-loss tumors. We anticipate initial clinical data in mid-2023.
We believe Foghorn has the potential to be a major biopharmaceutical company with our current pipeline addressing more than 20 tumor types impacting more than 500,000 new patients annually. We anticipate filing at least six new INDs over the next four years.
Our current pipeline of product candidates and discovery programs is focused on oncology and is shown below:
Foghorn’s science and potential have been validated by strategic collaborations with two world-leading pharmaceutical companies. 
•Loxo Oncology at Eli Lilly and Company: In December 2021, we entered into a strategic collaboration (the “Lilly Collaboration Agreement”) with Loxo Oncology at Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”). Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we are leveraging our platform technology to research, discover and develop therapeutic molecules directed to the selective BRM target and an additional undisclosed oncology target, and up to three additional discovery programs. 
•Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.: In July 2020, we entered into a Research Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement (the “Merck Collaboration Agreement”) with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (“Merck”) to apply our Gene Traffic Control platform to discover and develop novel therapeutics based on disruptors of a specified transcription factor target. 
We believe these two strategic collaborations confirm the rigor of our science, highlight the importance of the targets we are tackling and underscore the relevance of the biology on which we are focused.
How the Chromatin Regulatory System Orchestrates Gene Expression
The major components of the chromatin regulatory system are chromatin remodeling complexes, transcription factors, helicases and other chromatin related factors which work in concert to orchestrate gene expression. One important role for this system is to control the accessibility of chromatin which in turn determines if other factors necessary for gene expression can access the genetic material. In addition, the system controls the structure, modification, and repair of chromatin which are all necessary for proper control of gene expression. Because of the central role this system plays in orchestrating normal gene expression, aberrations in the system may result in disease. We believe our platform is uniquely suited to address these aberrations and treat these diseases.
Our Gene Traffic Control Platform
Our proprietary Gene Traffic Control platform gives us an integrated and mechanistic understanding of how the various components of the chromatin regulatory system interact, allowing us to identify, validate and drug targets within the system. In cancer, the mutations that are in or impinge on the chromatin regulatory system create genetically determined dependencies, on which the cancer cells rely for survival. These genetic dependencies result in diseased cell vulnerabilities, creating potential opportunities to selectively drug and kill diseased cells while minimizing impact to healthy cells. Our platform enables us to produce components of the chromatin regulatory system at scale, thereby allowing us to identify these genetic dependencies, understand their mechanism and target their vulnerabilities. We combine our genomic and epi-genomic tools, our proprietary high throughput screening technology and our expertise in medicinal chemistry to develop enzymatic inhibitors, protein degraders and transcription factor disruptors that target the chromatin regulatory system. While initially focused in oncology, we believe our platform is broadly applicable across other disease areas with efforts underway in autoimmune diseases.
Our Gene Traffic Control platform encompasses the following:
•Target Identification and Validation—We use genomic screens, and a suite of epi-genome sequencing and computational tools, including aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning, to characterize, identify, and validate targets within the chromatin regulatory system. Our epi-genome sequencing tools allow us to understand the mechanisms of how our drugs are modifying the chromatin structure. Our platform allows for the identification of genetically determined dependencies associated with the chromatin regulatory system.
•Production of Chromatin Regulatory System Components at Scale and Proprietary Assays—We have built unique capabilities to purify and synthesize chromatin remodeling complexes,transcription factors, helicases, and other chromatin related factors. These capabilities allow us to study the chromatin regulatory system at scale and in a context that, to our knowledge, is unavailable to others, and yields unique insights that are critical to systematically drugging this system.
•Discovery and Optimization of Chemical Matter—We perform proprietary high throughput screens that leverage our ability to produce the chromatin regulatory system components at scale. For example, we are able to screen for inhibitors of chromatin regulatory system component activity, for binders that we can turn into protein degraders, and for disruptors of transcription factor-chromatin remodeling complex interactions. Once we identify hits from our screens, we use our unique suite of assays involving the relevant component of the chromatin regulatory system to characterize, validate, and optimize our chemical matter.
•Targeted Protein Degradation—We have built extensive targeted protein degrader capabilities encompassing proprietary chemistry, high-throughput cellular screening capabilities, mechanistic assays to triage and rank compounds against multiple parameters, and ternary complex formation understanding through both biophysical structural determination and computational modeling. We develop both heterobifunctional degraders and non-cereblon based molecular glues that serve to bridge an interaction between an E3 ligase and target protein of interest. This induced proximity results in driving the target protein of interest for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. A demonstrated strength of our platform is leveraging degradation to enable selectivity which we have done now for several programs including BRD9, BRM, CBP, and EP300.
•Translation to Clinic and Identification of Biomarkers—Early in the drug discovery process, we use various genome and epi-genome analyses to understand the mechanism of the genetic dependency of the disease on the chromatin regulatory system. Our understanding of the mechanism of the dependency enables us to identify biomarkers for patient identification and treatment. We seek to enrich our clinical studies with the genetically relevant patient populations that are most likely to benefit from treatment.
Our Leadership
We have assembled a team with deep scientific, clinical, manufacturing, business, and leadership expertise in biotechnology, platform research, drug discovery, and development. Our management team has extensive experience discovering, developing, and commercializing drugs to treat patients with serious diseases. Adrian Gottschalk, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has more than 15 years of experience as a biopharmaceutical executive. Prior to joining Foghorn, Mr. Gottschalk served in various roles at Biogen, Inc., where he was most recently Senior Vice President and Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area Head. In this role, he was responsible for late-stage development and commercialization of drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our Chief Medical Officer, Samuel Agresta, M.D., M.P.H. & T.M., previously served as Chief Medical Officer at Infinity Pharmaceuticals and led the development of the marketed oncology drugs TIBSOVO® and IDHIFA® at Agios. Steven Bellon, PhD. was appointed to serve as the Company’s Chief Scientific Officer, effective as of January 10, 2022. Dr. Bellon joined Foghorn Therapeutics in 2016 as head of drug discovery, bringing more than 20 years of drug discovery experience from multiple drug classes. We have assembled an exceptional team of 161 employees as of December 31, 2022.
Our research efforts are also guided by world-class scientists and physicians on our Scientific Advisory Board, including David Schenkein, M.D., formerly the chief executive officer of Agios and presently a general partner and co-leader of Google Ventures life science team, Tony Kouzarides, Ph.D., F.Med.Sci., FRS, professor of cancer biology at the University of Cambridge and deputy director of the Gurdon Institute, United Kingdom, Gerald Crabtree, M.D., founder of Ariad Pharmaceuticals, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and professor at Stanford University, Charles Sawyers, M.D., chair of the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and past president of the American Association for Cancer Research, or AACR, and Cigall Kadoch, Ph.D., associate professor at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, member and program co-director at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. 
Our Beginnings: Foghorn Therapeutics and Flagship Pioneering
Foghorn Therapeutics was founded in 2015 by Flagship Pioneering, working together with academic co-founders Dr. Cigall Kadoch (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard, Broad Institute and Howard Hughes Medical Institute) and Dr. Gerald Crabtree (Stanford, Howard Hughes Medical Institute) to develop and commercialize a new category of first-in-class therapeutics to treat patients with cancer and other serious diseases. Our platform was inspired by work in the academic co-founders’ laboratories at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Stanford. This seminal work made it possible to understand how mutations cause disease by disrupting the machinery—the chromatin regulatory system—that orchestrates how cells turn genes on and off. Such mutations are associated with up to 50 percent of cancer and play roles in many other diseases. A Flagship Labs innovation team at Flagship Pioneering, led by Flagship Managing Partner, Dr. Douglas Cole, and, subsequently, Foghorn’s research and development team, established a fully integrated drug discovery platform based on this seminal work, which we call our Gene Traffic Control platform.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to leverage our unique insights into the chromatin regulatory system to pioneer the discovery, development and commercialization of a new class of therapies that transform the lives of patients suffering from a wide spectrum of diseases with high unmet need.
Our approach is to identify and drug genetically determined dependencies within the chromatin regulatory system. Our initial focus is in cancer with a precision oncology approach. Every program we have pursued to date is based on a genetic dependency on the chromatin regulatory system.
To achieve our mission, we are executing a strategy with the following key elements:
•Advance our lead precision oncology product candidates, FHD-286 and FHD-609, through clinical development in patients with select solid tumors and hematological cancers. FHD-286 and FHD-609 are a highly selective and potent enzymatic inhibitor and protein degrader, respectively, that target two different components of a chromatin remodeling complex. We believe our lead product candidates have the potential to address significant unmet medical needs across multiple oncology indications. 
•Expand our precision oncology pipeline by developing proprietary enzymatic inhibitors, degraders and disruptors that target genetically defined dependencies within the chromatin regulatory system. Based on our unique insights and understanding of the chromatin regulatory system, we continue to develop proprietary selective inhibitors, protein degraders and disruptors that modulate various components of the chromatin regulatory system. For example, using our proprietary platform, we have disclosed four distinct targets: BRM, ARID1B, CBP and EP300, that have genetically determined dependencies within the chromatin regulatory each of which has the potential to impact over one hundred thousand patients per year. We intend to use our platform to consistently develop novel product candidates to further deepen our precision oncology pipeline and have the potential to file six INDs over the next four years. 
•Harness our platform to develop novel product candidates to address therapeutic areas beyond oncology. As the orchestrator of gene expression, the chromatin regulatory system has implications in a large array of diseases. Based on academic literature and our research efforts, we believe our platform has significant potential across multiple therapeutic areas. We are committed to applying our Gene Traffic Control platform to additional therapeutic areas including virology and neurology. We currently have efforts underway in autoimmune diseases. We believe our platform will allow us to continue to build a long-term pipeline of novel product candidates to address areas of high unmet medical need.
•Continue to enhance our platform to extend our leading position in developing novel therapeutics targeting the chromatin regulatory system. Our platform and unique understanding of the chromatin regulatory system is built upon the groundbreaking work of our academic co-founders and has been further developed by our experienced team. We are committed to continuously integrating new insights, tools, technologies and capabilities to enhance our platform.
•Selectively enter into additional strategic partnerships to maximize the potential of our pipeline and our platform. Given the breadth of opportunities that are implicated by the chromatin regulatory system and the versatility of our platform, we may opportunistically enter into strategic collaborations intended to advance and accelerate our development programs, expand into new therapeutic areas and enhance the capabilities of our platform. In December 2021, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Lilly to create novel oncology medicines. The Lilly collaboration includes a co-development and co-commercialization agreement for the selective BRM oncology program and an additional undisclosed oncology target. In addition, the collaboration includes three additional discovery programs using Foghorn’s proprietary Gene Traffic Control platform. 
Additionally, in July 2020, we entered into a collaboration with Merck to discover and develop novel oncology therapeutics against a transcription factor target.
Chromatin Regulatory System: An Untapped Opportunity for Therapeutic Intervention
The major components of the chromatin regulatory system are chromatin remodeling complexes, transcription factors, helicases and other chromatin related factors which work in concert to orchestrate gene expression. One important role for this system is to control the accessibility of chromatin which in turn determines if other factors necessary for gene expression can access the genetic material. In addition, the system controls the structure, modification, and repair of chromatin which are all necessary for proper control of gene expression. Because of the central role this system plays in orchestrating normal gene expression, aberrations in the system may result in disease. Our platform is uniquely suited to correct these aberrations and treat these diseases.
While chromatin remodeling complexes have been known in the scientific community for decades, disease relevance was not initially recognized, and consequently chromatin remodeling complexes were underappreciated as a set of relevant drug targets. Transcription factors, helicases and other chromatin related factors, on the other hand, while linked decades ago to cancer and understood as relevant targets, have led to few approved oncology drugs, as companies seeking to drug these targets have lacked a systematic approach to doing so. Broad cancer sequencing initiatives have shown that mutations in the chromatin regulatory system are found in over 50 percent of all cancers, potentially impacting over 2.5 million cancer patients across the United States, Europe and Japan. Further work in the field has highlighted the association of this system in other therapeutic areas, including virology, autoimmune disease and neurology, implying even greater potential for therapeutic intervention.
Vulnerabilities in Cancer Created by Genetic Dependencies on the Chromatin Regulatory System
Cancer cells often contain many different mutations that lead to their abnormal growth and proliferation. Within cancer cells, these mutations give rise to genetically determined dependencies, upon which the cancer cells rely for their survival. The creation of these dependencies can be directly related to the mutation or to other cellular biology, thereby creating vulnerabilities for cancer cells and the opportunity for therapeutic intervention. In contrast, healthy cells, which lack these mutations and therefore these dependencies, are less susceptible to a therapeutic that targets these genetically determined dependencies.
Genetically determined dependencies may arise from mutations in various components of the chromatin regulatory system (e.g., chromatin remodeling complexes, helicases, transcription factors, chromatin related factors) or through mutations elsewhere in the cell that create dependencies on the system.
Our platform enables us to identify these genetic dependencies and thereby discover the cancer cells’ vulnerability within the chromatin regulatory system. We believe these vulnerabilities create opportunities to selectively drug and kill cancer cells while minimizing impact to healthy cells. These genetically determined dependencies enable us to select specific patient populations and enrich our clinical trials using a precision approach. Every program we have pursued to date is based on a genetically determined dependency on the chromatin regulatory system.
Our Approach to Drugging the Chromatin Regulatory System
We are focused on developing small molecule product candidates that target the chromatin regulatory system through the use of enzyme inhibitors, protein degraders and transcription factor disruptors.
•Enzyme inhibitors. These candidates have the potential to act on targets such as the ATPases BRG1 and BRM of the BAF complex. Our screening capabilities enable us to find allosteric inhibitors which afford additional selectivity over orthosteric, or direct, inhibitors.
•Protein degraders. These candidates are either heterobifunctional or molecular glue degraders which serve to specifically recruit a target to an E3 ligase component, resulting in the removal of the target protein by the cell’s native protein degradation system.
•Transcription factor disruptors. These candidates will be direct small-molecule disruptors of the protein-protein interactions between transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes.
We leverage the appropriate mechanism based on the target in the chromatin regulatory system. In some cases, we may take multiple approaches and remain modality agnostic in order to ensure we achieve the best approach and most appropriate molecule.
For components of the chromatin regulatory system that have an enzymatic function (e.g., chromatin remodeling complexes and helicases), we may leverage enzymatic inhibitors. For components of the system that are not amenable to enzymatic inhibition or where selectivity through inhibition may not be possible, we may leverage targeted protein degradation.
For transcription factor targets, we are leveraging where appropriate protein degradation and/or small molecule disruptors that can bind either to the transcription factor or its relevant binding partner (e.g., the BAF chromatin remodeling complex).
Our Gene Traffic Control Platform
The chromatin regulatory system has remained an untapped opportunity for therapeutic intervention due to the inability to systematically characterize and study its various components. Building upon the groundbreaking discoveries of our academic co-founders, we have developed our proprietary Gene Traffic Control platform which allows us to identify and validate targets within the chromatin regulatory system. We have unique capabilities to isolate, synthesize, characterize, and interrogate components of the system at a level of scale, precision, and efficiency, that to our knowledge, no others have achieved.
Our capabilities and insights have enabled the development of a suite of unique biochemical, biophysical, structural, and functional assays. We use these assays to discover and optimize novel small molecule chemical matter which include enzymatic inhibitors, protein degraders, and transcription factor disruptors to various targets within the chromatin regulatory system. To our knowledge, we are the only company that has the ability to study the chromatin regulatory system at scale, in context, and in an integrated way.
Our Gene Traffic Control platform encompasses the following:
•Target Identification and Validation
•Production of Chromatin Regulatory System Components at Scale and Proprietary Assays
•Discovery and Optimization of Chemical Matter
•Targeted Protein Degradation
•Translation to Clinic and Identification of Biomarkers
The key features and capabilities of our platform are described below:
Target Identification and Validation
We use genomic screens and a suite of epi-genome sequencing and computational tools to characterize, identify and validate targets within the chromatin regulatory system. Our epi-genome sequencing tools allow us to understand the mechanisms of how our drugs are modifying the chromatin structure. Our platform allows for the identification of genetically determined dependencies associated with the chromatin regulatory system. Specifically, we:
•Conduct and leverage genomic screens to identify dependencies and relationships. We utilize both broad and specific genomic screens to identify dependencies and relationships associated with the chromatin regulatory system. We use a mix of internal and external data sets that apply CRISPR and shRNA technology to understand relationships across and within a range of cancer cell lines.
•Perform broad epi-genome sequencing to validate dependencies in vitro. We apply cutting edge epi-genome sequencing tools in combination with proprietary tool compounds to further validate targets and enhance our understanding of the impact of drugging the chromatin regulatory system. These tools allow us to rapidly understand the gene expression profiles of specific cancer cell lines, the open / closed state of chromatin, and give us mechanistic understanding of how components of the system work together.
•Apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance discovery efforts. We have built tools that allow us to mine and interpret external and internal datasets that aid in our discovery efforts yielding unbiased and unsupervised computer analyses to identify targets and genetic dependencies on the chromatin regulatory system and to further understand mechanism of action. Examples of external data sets include data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Broad Institute. Internal data sets include data from cell lines, data from xenograft models and epi-genomic information (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, CHiP-seq, SNAP-seq). We also use these tools in the preclinical stage to evaluate cancer cell lines & patient samples to identify biomarkers for patient stratification and patient population identification.
•Validate dependencies in vivo. Where possible, we endeavor to validate targets in various animal models with implanted cancer cells relevant to the disease we are aiming to treat. Specifically, we use mouse xenograft models with inducible CRISPR / shRNA to validate that knockdown of our target of interest results in tumor growth inhibition. We also apply epi-genome sequencing tools in the animal model setting to identify potential biomarkers.
Production of Chromatin Regulatory System Components at Scale and Proprietary Assays
We have built unique capabilities to purify and synthesize components of the chromatin regulatory system (chromatin remodeling complexes, transcription factors helicases, chromatin related factors). These capabilities allow us to study the chromatin regulatory system at scale and in context that, to our knowledge, is unavailable to others, and yields insights that are critical to systematically drugging this system. Specifically, we:
•Purify and synthesize chromatin remodeling complexes and transcription factors at scale. Our platform has the unique ability to purify and synthesize chromatin remodeling complexes such as the BAF complex, as well as mutant forms of these complexes. We also produce and screen full length version of transcription factors and other chromatin regulatory system components. 
•Structural Biology. We believe that the three dimensional structure of chromatin regulatory system components provides a mechanistic understanding of the targets and thus enables drug discovery. We have repeatably been able to determine three dimensional structures for various chromatin regulatory system targets, including x-ray structures of the enzymes targets, ternary structures of protein degrader targets, and mass spectrometry mapping of transcription factor - chromatin remodeling complex interactions.
Discovery and Optimization of Chemical Matter
We perform proprietary high throughput screens that leverage our ability to produce the chromatin regulatory system components at scale. An example screen is the use of the fully assembled BAF complex which is specific to its mutated or disease relevant form (e.g., screening the BRM form of BAF which corresponds to BRG1 mutated cancer). We utilize both proprietary and publicly available chemical libraries in our screens.
Once we find hits from our screens, we use our unique suite of biophysical assays involving the relevant component of the chromatin regulatory system to characterize, validate, and optimize our chemical matter. These assays provide us with biologically relevant insights that guide our medicinal chemistry efforts.
Targeted Protein Degradation
For targets in the portfolio whose biology demonstrates that degradation could offer a therapeutic advantage, we develop small molecule heterobifunctional or non-cereblon based molecular glue degraders. Many of our targets play important scaffolding roles in chromatin remodeling complexes and/or are not enzymes. Therefore, inhibition would not be effective or possible. Protein degraders recruit target proteins to specific E3 ligase complexes and by doing so, promote the removal of the target protein by harnessing the cell’s ubiquitin and proteasome-based degradation system. This approach results in rapid loss and clearance from the cell of disease driving proteins and is a powerful complement to our inhibitor programs.
We have a broad and highly efficient degradation development, screening, and triaging platform. This know-how and capabilities include:
•Proprietary library of linkers and E3 ligase binders for heterobifunctional degrader development;
•Proprietary screening strategy for novel non-cereblon based molecular glue discovery;
•Biochemical, biophysical, and cellular assays that characterize protein degrader mechanism of action and guide optimization, including degradation kinetics, ubiquitination, and permeability;
•Ternary complex structural determination and molecular modeling; and
•Global proteomics and mass spectrometry to measure selectivity in an unbiased fashion.
Translation to Clinic and Identification of Biomarkers
We seek to enrich our clinical studies with the genetically relevant patient populations that are most likely to benefit from treatment. Early in the drug discovery process, we use various genome and epi-genome analyses to understand the genetic dependency of the cancer on the chromatin regulatory system. Our intent is to have clear genetic markers for patients whom we seek to potentially treat.
As we progress a drug candidate, we analyze tumor models and where available direct patient samples to understand biomarkers of response (e.g., change in expression level of a particular gene or set of genes, change in protein level of a component of the chromatin regulatory system). We intend to use these biomarkers in our clinical studies to understand tumor response to our drug candidates. Additionally, we will retrospectively analyze our clinical studies for any other biomarkers that will further enhance patient stratification and response.
Our Product Candidates
We are developing a broad pipeline of product candidates that target genetically determined dependencies within the chromatin regulatory system. Our programs consist of enzyme inhibitors, protein degraders and transcription factor disruptors. For FHD-286, we initiated two separate Phase 1 studies for (i) metastatic uveal melanoma and relapsed and/or refractory AML and MDS in May 2021. For our second product candidate, FHD-609, we initiated a Phase 1 study for the treatment of synovial sarcoma in August 2021. In August of 2022, we amended the protocol for FHD-609 and added SMARCB1-loss tumors as an additional potential indication.
FHD-286
Overview
We are currently advancing our lead product candidate, FHD-286, in two separate Phase 1 clinical studies in (i) metastatic uveal melanoma and (ii) relapsed and/or refractory AML and MDS. FHD-286 is a highly potent, selective, allosteric and orally available, small-molecule, enzymatic inhibitor of BRG1 and BRM, for the potential treatment of uveal melanoma, AML and MDS. BRG1 and BRM are two highly similar proteins that serve as the ATPases, or the catalytic engines, across all forms of BAF. Our preclinical data in both AML and uveal melanoma animal xenograft models demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity. The multi-center, Phase 1 studies are primarily assessing the safety and tolerability of FHD-286 in adults with uveal melanoma, relapsed and/or refractory AML and MDS. Secondary endpoints include the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of FHD-286 as well as clinical activity. Proof of mechanism will be based on indicators of target engagement in association with FHD-286 treatment. As we further understand the therapeutic potential of FHD-286 in the course of these initial clinical studies, we may pursue additional clinical studies in these and other indications as a single agent and/or in combination with novel or standard of care agents. The relapsed and/or refractory AML and MDS study is currently on full clinical hold by the FDA due to the observation of potential differentiation syndrome and potential linkages to grade 5 safety events. Differentiation syndrome is associated with AML and MDS therapeutics that induce differentiation, an effect that is believed to be on-target for the proposed mechanism of action for FHD-286. We are currently working with the FDA to resolve the hold as quickly as possible and anticipate providing clarity on the development path in the first half of 2023. We expect initial clinical data for metastatic uveal melanoma, which is unaffected by the clinical hold, in the first half of 2023. 
Uveal Melanoma Overview
Uveal melanoma is the most frequent type of ocular cancer with over 5,000 cases each year in major markets (United States, EU5 and Japan), typically presenting upon a routine eye exam in patients without specific symptoms. Local treatment, primarily with radiation therapy, is effective in preventing local recurrence in over 95 percent of cases. Due to the asymptomatic nature of uveal melanoma, at the time of the diagnosis, a considerable portion of these patients already have metastatic disease, typically in the liver. Roughly half of all patients will eventually develop metastases. For those diagnosed with metastatic disease, the one-year survival is only 15 percent. The poor prognosis associated with metastatic disease and the limited effective therapies highlights the need for novel therapeutic approaches that specifically target metastatic uveal melanoma. 
Between 85 percent and 95 percent of uveal melanoma tumors contain mutations in one of two G-protein-coupled receptor subunits: GNAQ or GNA11. We have established through uveal melanoma cell lines with the GNAQ/GNA11 mutations that there is a dependency of these cell lines on two over expressed transcription factors, MITF and SOX10. In uveal melanoma, these two transcription factors abnormally interact with the BAF complex.
AML Disease Overview
AML is a heterogeneous group of hematologic cancers characterized by a proliferation of myeloid precursors, commonly known as blasts, with limited ability to differentiate into more mature myeloid cells. These blasts replace normal hematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow, resulting in decreased hematologic cell numbers, or pancytopenia, and the morbidities associated with the cancer.
AML is the second most common subtype of leukemia in adults. In major markets (United States, EU5 and Japan), AML has an incidence of approximately 35,000 cases annually and is generally a disease of elderly people, with more than 60 percent of diagnosed patients being older than 60 years. The average five-year survival rate for patients with AML is 20 percent, and there are significant differences in prognosis depending on several factors, including the age of the patient and co-morbidities at diagnosis. For patients under the age of 60, the five-year survival rate is approximately 33 percent, while for those over the age of 60 it is less than 15 percent. There are likely multiple reasons for this discrepancy, including the ability of younger patients to tolerate more aggressive therapies.
Current first-line treatments for patients with AML typically involve aggressive combination chemotherapy regimens with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (“HSCT”). Older patients or patients who cannot tolerate HSCT, typically those with comorbidities, are often treated with cytarabine and daunorubicin induction followed by high-dose cytarabine 
consolidation. Patients who cannot tolerate combination chemotherapy receive low dose cytarabine, azacitidine, Venclexta ® , and/or enroll in clinical trials. There is a single biologic, gemtuzumab ozogamicin or Mylotarg, approved by the FDA for newly diagnosed and relapsed-refractory AML. Other, more recently approved therapeutics for AML target subsets of patients with tumors containing specific mutations such as midostaurin marketed as Rydapt® by Novartis for those with FLT3 mutations, enasidenib marketed as Idhifa® by Bristol Myers for those with mutations in IDH2, and ivosidenib, marketed as Tibsovo® by Agios for those with mutations in IDH1.
Despite these advances, patients who do achieve remission, five-year disease-free survival is only 30-40 percent because the majority of patients relapse. Patients in the elderly population have a relapse rate of 80-90 percent. Younger patients have a relapse rate of between 60-80 percent. There remains a significant need for safe, durable and broadly effective AML treatments.
Our Solution: FHD-286
FHD-286 is a highly potent, selective, allosteric and orally available, small molecule inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of both BRG1 and BRM. Either BRG1 or BRM can serve as the primary ATPase, or catalytic engine, of the BAF complex. BAF complexes will contain only BRG1 or BRM, as they are mutually exclusive subunits, as shown in the figure below. BRG1 or BRM are two proteins which are 76 percent identical at the amino acid level over their entire length and over 90 percent identical in the catalytic region. We are currently conducting separate Phase 1 studies for (i) metastatic uveal melanoma and (ii) relapsed and/or refractory AML and MDS. The relapsed and/or refractory AML and MDS study is currently on full clinical hold by the FDA due to the observation of potential differentiation syndrome and potential linkages to grade 5 safety events. We are currently working with the FDA to resolve the hold as quickly as possible and anticipate providing clarity on the development path in the first half of 2023. We expect initial clinical data for metastatic uveal melanoma, which is unaffected by the clinical hold, in the first half of 2023. 
Figure 1. The enzymatic activity of the BAF complex is provided by the BRM or BRG1 subunits.
When we conducted compound screening against a panel of tumor cell lines, a number of these tumor cell lines were shown to be highly sensitive to BRG1 or BRM inhibition over a three-day period. These cell lines include nineteen of twenty-one of the hematopoietic malignancy cell lines tested, all four of the uveal melanoma cell lines, three out of four prostate tumor cell lines, and three out of seven breast tumor cell lines. We observed additional sensitivity in other tumor cell lines tested over a seven-day period. 
Figure 2. Certain cell lines, including those derived from uveal melanoma, hematological cancers, prostate cancer, and breast cancer were highly sensitive to BRG1/BRM inhibition.
Our Preclinical Data for AML
Genetic studies have identified a critical role of BRG1 in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of AML cells. Knockdown of the expression of BRG1 was found both to inhibit the expression of genes associated with high proliferation and to induce the expression of genes associated with mature myeloid cells. In a mouse model of AML, partial genetic inactivation of BRG1 led to a greater than two-fold increase in overall survival. These data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of BRG1 may provide a therapeutic benefit.
We have generated in vivo proof of concept data that demonstrated antitumor activity of FHD-286 in AML patient samples as well as multiple AML CDX models. Using tumor cells isolated from AML patients, we demonstrated that treatment with FHD-286 allowed for appropriate differentiation of AML cells. We treated these tumor cells with a single dose of FHD-286 at increasing exposures and assessed the effects on both myeloid cellular differentiation and cell death. We observed myeloid cellular differentiation at a lower nanomolar exposure relative to where we observed cell death. The data support that pharmacologic inhibition of BRG1 can release the differentiation block associated with BRG1 overexpression in AML. Ongoing research has revealed that transcription factors interacting with over-expressed BRG1 containing BAF complexes are implicated in AML. Targeted treatment that releases a differentiation block has been observed to be clinically meaningful with ATRA treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia as well as IDH1 and IDH2 inhibition in IDH-mutated AML. The cell killing observed was comparable to the effect of standard of care combinations: cytarabine plus daunorubicin and azacytidine plus venetoclax.
Figure 3. Treatment of patient-derived AML tumor samples with FHD-286 stimulated differentiation and cell death. Dose-dependent reduction of blast counts in samples from patients. The blast count was normalized and plotted as relative to the level in vehicle DMSO-treated samples. The level of blast count reduction achieved by standards of care (Aza + venetoclax and “7+3”) are indicated by the dashed lines. BM = Bone Marrow.
We have confirmed the sensitivity observed in our three-day cell line panel in CDX models created using OCI-AML2 and MV4-11, two AML cell lines with different underlying genetic mutations. In addition, we have observed robust dose response in further evaluation of FHD-286 in MV4-11 CDX models. We have also observed synergy of FHD-286 in combination with cytarabine.
Figure 4. FHD-286, dosed as monotherapy, led to tumor growth inhibition in two AML xenograft models MV4-11 and OCI-AML-2.
Our Preclinical Data for Uveal Melanoma
In uveal melanoma cell lines that contain GNAQ/GNA11 mutations, genetic studies have revealed that these cells over expressed two transcription factors, MITF and SOX10. Our data showed that the MITF and SOX10 transcription factors abnormally over-interacted with the BAF complex in uveal melanoma cell lines. By inhibiting the ATPase activity, both BRG1 and BRM, of the BAF complex, we observed anti-tumor effects in several CDX and patient-derived xenograft, or PDX, uveal melanoma models.
We established the genetic dependency of uveal melanoma cell lines on MITF and SOX10 by analyzing data from the Project Achilles, a functional genomics screen conducted by the Broad Institute. We found that established uveal melanoma cell lines such as 92-1 and OMM1 were highly dependent on MITF or SOX10.
Figure 5. Uveal melanoma cell lines, such as 92-1 and OMM1, were highly dependent on MITF or SOX10.
We found that inhibition of BRG1 and BRM led to suppression of gene expression from several MITF and SOX10-dependent genes. A broader measure of the effect of dual inhibition of BRG1 and BRM on transcription of MITF and SOX10-dependent genes was obtained using a technique known as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, or ChIP-seq. ChIP-seq allows us to find where particular proteins, in this case transcription factors, are binding to chromatin. Treatment of uveal melanoma cells with a research compound with similar properties to that of FHD-286 resulted in decreased binding of both MITF and SOX10 transcription factors to their respective chromatin binding sites. These results validate the mechanism of action of FHD-286 in uveal melanoma cells.
Figure 6. BRG1/BRM inhibitor blocked the ability of MITF and SOX10 to bind to their target sequences as determined by ChIP-seq.
We have generated in vivo proof of concept data that demonstrated antitumor activity of FHD-286 in multiple uveal melanoma CDX and PDX models. In two uveal melanoma models, 92-1 and MP-46, oral dosing of FHD-286 at 1.5 mg/kg as monotherapy resulted in tumor growth regression and inhibition, respectively. Importantly, doses of FHD-286 of up to 1.5 mg/kg were well-tolerated in that FHD-286 at these doses did not lead to changes in body weight considered to be clinically meaningful compared to controls (e.g., changes greater than 10 percent of body weight), a commonly used measure of safety.
Figure 7. FHD-286 led to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in two uveal melanoma xenograft models 92-1 and MP-46.
Clinical Studies for FHD-286 in AML and Uveal Melanoma
We are currently conducting separate Phase 1 studies with FHD-286 in (i) metastatic uveal melanoma and (ii) relapsed and/or refractory AML and MDS. 
The first-in-human Phase 1 study in AML and MDS is an accelerated titration design with two parts. Part one is the dose escalation phase that enrolls a single patient per dose (n=1) until certain criteria are met. The trial converts to a 3+3 design once relevant pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, or PK/PD, safety and or clinical activity are observed. The dose escalation portion is designed to evaluate multiple ascending oral doses of FHD-286, with a starting dose determined by our GLP toxicology studies. Dose escalation includes patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML or MDS. The second part of the study is an expansion phase. This phase will include multiple distinct cohorts of patients with AML, informed by findings from the dose escalation phase. Initially, biomarkers, such as the association of clinical activity and BRG1 expression levels, are evaluated retrospectively. The primary objective of this first-in-human study is an evaluation of safety and tolerability, and the identification of the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose. The secondary objectives include an evaluation of preliminary clinical activity and pharmacokinetics. Biomarkers are evaluated in an exploratory fashion, evaluating markers associated with response. Prospective enrollment based on biomarker findings may be included in the expansion phase of the study.

We intend to explore the potential value of multiple biomarkers to further understand and accelerate drug development. Biomarkers include assessment of various tumor mutations, as well as expression levels of BRG1 and BRM. These biomarkers may be used for future patient selection, measurements of target engagement and biochemical and cellular measures associated with efficacy.
We are evaluating multiple tumor types in the preclinical setting to determine our indication expansion strategy for FHD-286.
FHD-609
Overview
We are currently advancing FHD-609, a highly potent, selective and intravenous, small molecule protein degrader of BRD9, a subunit of a form of the BAF complex. Nearly all synovial sarcoma cancers harbor SS18-SSX mutations. These mutations render the cancer genetically dependent upon BRD9. FHD-609 has two domains: one that binds with high potency and selectivity to BRD9 and the other that binds to a receptor on the E3 ligase complex that directs proteins for destruction. Our preclinical data in synovial sarcoma animal xenograft models demonstrate anti-tumor effects and supported progressing FHD-609 into clinical studies. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 study with FHD-609 for the treatment of synovial sarcoma and SMARCB1-deleted cancers and anticipate initial data in mid-2023. This multi-center Phase 1 study is primarily assessing the safety and tolerability of FHD-609 in patients with synovial sarcoma. Secondary endpoints include the PK/PD properties of FHD-609 as well as clinical activity. Proof of mechanism will be based on indicators of target engagement in association with FHD-609 treatment. As we further understand the therapeutic potential of FHD-609 in the course of the initial clinical studies, we may pursue additional clinical studies in synovial sarcoma, as a single agent and/or in combination with novel or standard of care agents. 
Synovial Sarcoma Overview
Synovial sarcoma is a cancer of the connective tissue and most commonly originates in the arms or legs. Synovial sarcoma occurs most frequently in adolescents and young adults. There is an incidence over 1,800 new cases of synovial sarcoma in the United States, EU5 and Japan. Approximately 30 percent of synovial sarcomas occur in patients under 20 years of age with 84 percent of cases occurring in patients under 50 years of age.
Delay in diagnosis and treatment of synovial sarcoma is common because it is recognized simply by a lump that gradually grows over time. The primary treatment for synovial sarcoma is surgical excision of the tumor and surrounding normal tissue with the goal of sparing the limb if possible. Failure to adequately excise a sufficient area of tissue surrounding the tumor leads to recurrence rates of over 70 percent. Surgical resection is then followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy or both. However, there appears to be minimal benefit of these post-surgical treatments other than for palliative reasons. Radiation and chemotherapy are used in the neoadjuvant setting, or before surgery, to improve the chances of a successful limb sparing surgery.
Approximately ten percent of cases originally present as metastatic disease, and half of all cases eventually develop into metastatic disease. Eighty percent of metastases are localized in the lungs. Five-year survival rates for younger patients with early-stage disease are approximately 76 percent; however, this decreases to approximately 20 percent in patients over age 30 with advanced disease.
There are no therapies specifically approved by the FDA for synovial sarcoma patients with metastatic disease. Pazopanib, marketed as Votrient® by Novartis has been approved by the FDA for treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in patients who had received prior chemotherapy. In a Phase 3 soft tissue sarcoma trial that included a total of 369 patients, the progression-free survival time for the subset of patients with synovial sarcoma was 4.1 months (N=25) compared to 0.9 months for those who received placebo (N=13). Other chemotherapeutic agents that may be used for palliative purposes include ifosfamide.
Synovial sarcomas are characterized by a chromosomal translocation that results in the fusion of the SS18 gene to one of three genes: SSX1, SSX2 and SSX4, creating SS18-SSX gene fusions. These gene fusions are unique in synovial sarcoma and create a protein not found in healthy patients that fuels the growth and proliferation of the cancer cells. In the scientific literature, the process has been described as the gene fusion “hijacking” the BAF complex, altering its function and causing it to unpack chromatin at wrong locations.
SS18 is a component of the BAF complex. The SS18-SSX fusion protein can also be incorporated into the BAF complex, leading to synovial sarcoma. Genomic screening in synovial sarcoma cells has identified a genetic dependency between synovial sarcoma cells containing SS18-SSX fusions and BRD9, a subunit of the ncBAF complex.
Figure 8. Synovial sarcoma cell lines were highly dependent on BRD9.
Our Solution: FHD-609
FHD-609 is a highly potent, selective and intravenous, heterobifunctional degrader of BRD9. Unlike many traditional intracellular drug targets, BRD9 is not an enzyme. We therefore designed FHD-609 as a protein degrader, a molecule with two binding domains, one to the bromodomain of BRD9 and the second to the E3 ligase component, Cereblon. Upon ternary complex formation, ubiquitination of BRD9 is increased and BRD9 is subsequently degraded via the proteasome. Further global proteomic studies showed in synovial sarcoma cell lines that BRD9 was the only target of degradation of FHD-609.
Our Preclinical Data for Synovial Sarcoma
We have generated in vivo proof of concept data that demonstrated antitumor activity of FHD-609 in synovial sarcoma CDX models. In the synovial sarcoma SYO1 CDX model containing the SS18-SSX2 mutation, dosing with FHD-609 led to potent inhibition of tumor growth. Intraperitoneal doses of FHD-609 yielded similar antitumor activity whether dosing was delivered as a once-weekly (every 7 days for three weeks) or an equivalent drug amount delivered daily over seven days for three weeks (3.5 mg/kg delivered every week versus 0.5 mg/kg delivered daily over 7 days). This suggests that sustained tumor regression can occur with a less frequent dosing regimen, which will be explored in clinical development. In the model, tumor growth inhibition levels were associated with levels of BRD9 degradation as indicated below.
Figure 9. FHD-609 led to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition of synovial sarcoma tumors equivalently at a once weekly or daily treatment schedule. On the right, the western blot shows dose-dependent BRD9 degradation correlating with the anti-tumor activity.
In the synovial sarcoma ASKA CDX model containing the SS18-SSX1 mutation, the antitumor activity of FHD-609 was comparable and superior to that observed for other systemic therapeutic agents. In this model FHD-609 was dosed intravenously twice per week, ifosfamide as a monotherapy intravenously on days one through three every three weeks, and pazopanib orally once daily. FHD-609 led to robust tumor suppression, with meaningful suppression observed through 40 days at the highest studied dose of 2 mg/kg.
Figure 10. FHD-609 resulted in tumor regression in the ASKA synovial sarcoma xenograft model. FHD-609 demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition compared to either ifosfamide or pazopanib.
Importantly, after discontinuation of FHD-609, treatment with FHD-609 was associated with sustained tumor growth inhibition. Following discontinuance of FHD-609 treatment at 2 mg/kg, at approximately day 21 tumor regrowth was not detectable for at least another 15 days. We believe these results support the targeted degradation of BRD9 and its importance in synovial sarcoma.
ASKA Synovial Sarcoma CDX Model
Figure 11. FHD-609 treatment was associated with sustained tumor suppression after treatment withdrawal.
As FHD-609 recruits the Cereblon E3 ligase component, further preclinical experiments were performed to demonstrate no off-target degradation activity of Cereblon immunomodulatory (“IMiD”) targets. These data also show selectivity with FHD-609, potentially avoiding the adverse effects associated with unwanted off-target degradation.
Figure 12. FHD-609 is highly selective with no off-target IMiD neosubstrate degradation activity observed.
Clinical Studies for FHD-609 in Synovial Sarcoma and SMARCB1-deleted cancers
The first-in-human study in synovial sarcoma and SMARCB1-deleted cancers includes a standard dose escalation and expansion phase. The dose escalation portion is a Phase 1 design with a starting dose determined by the GLP toxicology studies. Dose escalation may include treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced patients with metastatic synovial sarcoma. The expansion phase may include multiple distinct cohorts of synovial sarcoma patients, informed by findings from the dose escalation phase. Initially, biomarkers such as the association of clinical activity and SS18-SSX mutational status will be evaluated retrospectively.
The primary endpoints of this first-in-human study are safety, the identification of any dose-limiting toxicities, the maximum tolerated dose, the recommended Phase 2 dose, and the evaluation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The secondary endpoints include an evaluation of clinical activity: overall response rate, duration of response and additional time to event analyses. Biomarkers will be evaluated in an exploratory fashion, evaluating target engagement as well as markers associated with response and/or resistance. Prospective enrollment based on biomarker findings may be included in the expansion phase of the study. As we further understand the therapeutic potential of FHD-609 in the course of the initial clinical studies, we may 
pursue additional clinical studies in synovial sarcoma and SMARCB1-deleted cancers, as a single agent and/or in combination with novel or standard of care agents. 
Early Clinical Data for FHD-609 in Synovial Sarcoma
In 2022, we presented patient biopsy data from the ongoing study of FHD-609 in synovial sarcoma. Initial clinical data from two patients in the study with metastatic synovial sarcoma treated with the same low dose of FHD-609 from the ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation study, show degradation of BRD9 in on-treatment metastatic tumor biopsies.
Figure 13. FHD-609 treatment as shown in tumor biopsies demonstrate target engagement with degradation of BRD9.
BRM-Selective Modulators
Overview
Broad cancer sequencing initiatives have shown that BRG1 is one of the most highly mutated subunits of the BAF complex. BRG1 was found to be mutated in approximately five percent of tumors sequenced as part of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center MSK-IMPACT study, and in up to ten percent of NSCLC tumors. Beyond NSCLC, the MSK-IMPACT study highlighted BRG1 mutations in over thirty different types of tumors. In many cases, these mutations lead to a loss of enzymatic activity in the BRG1 subunit, creating a genetically determined dependency on BRM. This loss of BRG1 and subsequent dependency on BRM leads to a drugging opportunity. We are currently developing selective modulators of BRM to target this genetic dependency in BRG1 mutated cancers. In December 2021, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Lilly to create novel oncology medicines. The Lilly collaboration includes a co-development and co-commercialization agreement for the selective BRM oncology program.
12 Tumor Types with Highest Prevalence of BRG-1 Mutations
Figure 14. The above chart highlights the cancers with the highest prevalence of BRG1 mutations from the MSK-IMPACT study.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (“NSCLC”) Overview
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death, accounting for approximately 18 percent of all cancer deaths globally or an estimated 1.8 million deaths per year. There are an estimated 228,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed and 135,000 deaths in the United States annually. NSCLC accounts for 80 to 85 percent of lung cancer cases. Genetic profiling of tumors has identified a number of genes that are altered in NSCLC. The standard of care for NSCLC has included conventional chemotherapy with or without a checkpoint inhibitor. Targeted therapies developed for the proteins encoded by some of these genes such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene, or ALK, have been approved and are now part of the standard of care of patents with NSCLC. However, less than 30 percent of NSCLC patients have alterations in these two genes. Up to two thirds of NSCLC patients who are ineligible for or resistant to treatment with EGFR or ALK targeted therapies have tumors that express PD-L1 and are candidates for checkpoint inhibitor therapies, which lead to significant improvements in progression free survival and overall survival compared to standard chemotherapy. Despite the availability of both targeted and conventional therapies, the prognosis in NSCLC remains poor, with an overall five-year survival for all patients diagnosed with NSCLC of 19 percent.
An analysis of genomic data in NSCLC cancer patients, collected as part of MSK-IMPACT, revealed that gene alterations in BRG1 were found in ten percent of NSCLC samples. In a retrospective analysis conducted by MSKCC it was observed that among patients with BRG1-deficient NSCLC who received first-line platinum doublet chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, median progression-free survival was 38 days and 35 days, respectively. Prognosis is poor in patients with BRG1-deficient NSCLC, highlighting the importance of developing novel therapeutics that address this unmet need.
MSK-IMPACT: BRG-1 Mutated in 10% of NSCLC
Figure 15. BRG1 gene alterations are found in 10 percent of NSCLC tumors and have minimal overlap with other actionable mutations present in NSCLC, such as EGFR and ALK.
Genomic screening of over 400 cancer cell lines that remove BRM via CRISPR revealed a genetic dependency of certain BRG1-mutated cancers on BRM. This finding suggests that selective inhibition of BRM has the potential to be therapeutically meaningful in certain cancers with BRG1 mutations.
Figure 16. In a screen of over 400 cancer cell lines, inactivation of the BRM gene resulted in selective inhibition of cell lines containing mutations in BRG1.
Our Solution: Selective BRM Modulators
With our collaboration partner, Lilly, we are advancing two classes of molecules, an enzymatic inhibitor and a protein degrader, as selective modulators of BRM.
One class consists of selective, allosteric inhibitors of the ATPase activity of BRM. We are designing these inhibitors to be more selective for BRM than the very similar ATPase BRG1. Through our proprietary methods of isolating and screening BAF complexes that contain either BRG1 or BRM, we have identified highly selective small molecule inhibitors targeting BRM.
Figure 17. This panel showed BRM enzymatic inhibitor in vivo efficacy in a A549-BRG1 Mutant NSCLC Model with corresponding body weight and plasma exposure versus the vehicle control and Cisplatin.
Our other approach to selective BRM modulation consists of protein degrader molecules that activate the cell’s protein degradation system to selectively destroy BRM. One domain of the BRM degrader molecule is a potent and selective binder of BRM. This is chemically linked to a domain that binds to a receptor on the E3 ligase complex. In cells, these protein degrader molecules bring their target into proximity of the E3 ligase which marks these target proteins for destruction by the cell’s protein degradation system. We have shown that it is possible to identify protein degraders that lead to the destruction of BRM while leaving BRG1 untouched. 
Selective Degradation of BRM
Figure 18. Selective BRM degrading molecules led to the degradation of over 75 percent of BRM while leaving the levels of BRG1 virtually unchanged.
Selective CBP Degrader for EP300 Mutated Cancers
CREB binding protein serves as a critical co-activator for transcription factors involved in signaling pathways in a subset of cancers including bladder, colorectal, breast, gastric and lung. Data suggest that there are over 100,000 patients with EP300 mutations that would potentially benefit from a therapy selectively targeting CBP.
Figure 19. In a screen of over 400 cancer cell lines, inactivation of the EP300 gene resulted in selective growth inhibition of cell lines containing mutations in CBP, establishing the dependency on EP300 in these cell lines.
CBP and EP300 are chromatin regulators and histone acetyltransferases and are highly homologous with similar domain structure and architecture. Functional genomics screens have shown that CBP and EP300 share a bi-directional synthetic lethal relationship. As a result, loss of function of one of these proteins leads to dependency on the other. 
We are developing selective CBP degraders and plan to exploit the bi-directional synthetic lethal relationship it shares with its paralog acetyltransferase, EP300, to identify and treat those patients with EP300 mutated cancers. We believe selectively targeting and degrading CBP will potentially offer a tolerability advantage compared with non-selectively degrading both targets. 
We have tested a selective degrader of CBP across multiple cancers including gastric, colorectal, and bladder, which has demonstrated CBP-dependent cell killing in cell proliferation assays as shown in the figure below.
Figure 20. A selective degrader of CBP tested across multiple cancers has demonstrated CBP-dependent cell killing in cell proliferation assays. 
Selective EP300 Degrader for CBP Mutated Cancers and EP300 Dependent Cancers
We are developing a selective EP300 degrader targeting CBP mutant cancers and subsets of EP300 dependent hematologic malignancies. The Selective EP300 program has potential in various cancers which include bladder, NSCLC, various lymphomas and leukemias and could provide a new therapeutic option for more than 100,000 patients a year.
Figure 21. In a screen of over 400 cancer cell lines, inactivation of the CBP gene resulted in selective growth inhibition of cell lines containing mutations in EP300, establishing the dependency on CBP in these cell lines.
We have tested a selective degrader of EP300 in a number of cell lines which has demonstrated degradation and EP300-dependent cell killing in the cell proliferation assays as shown in the figure below:
Figure 22. A selective degrader of EP300 tested in a number of cell lines has demonstrated degradation and EP300-dependent cell killing in cell proliferation assays.
Selective ARID1B Degrader for ARID1A Mutated Cancers
The ARID1A subunit is the most mutated subunit within the BAF complex. Mutations in ARID1A confer a dependency on the ARID1B subunit of the BAF complex. ARID1A mutations are implicated in ovarian, endometrial, colorectal, bladder, and gastric cancers. Data suggest that there are over 175,000 patients with ARID1A mutations that would potentially benefit from a therapy selectively targeting ARID1B.
Figure 23. In a screen of over 400 cancer cell lines, inactivation of the ARID1B gene resulted in selective growth inhibition of cell lines containing mutations in ARID1A, establishing the dependency on ARID1B in these cell lines.
Since ARID1B is not an enzyme, our strategy is to selectively degrade ARID1B. Our platform allows us to generate full BAF complexes containing only ARID1A or ARID1B. Using our platform, we have conducted high throughput screens and have validated selective chemical matters to the ARID1B protein that we are seeking to optimize as protein degrader product candidates.
Targeting Transcription Factors: Disrupting Transcription Factor Binding to Chromatin Remodeling Complexes
Transcription factors work in concert with chromatin remodeling complexes, BAF as one example, to orchestrate gene expression. In tumor cells, genes encoding transcription factors are often amplified, deleted, rearranged via chromosomal translocation or subjected to point mutations that result in a gain or loss of function. We have developed a set of tools to visualize and study the interactions between transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes. To our knowledge, we are the only company with these capabilities.
We are using these capabilities to drive our drug discovery efforts across multiple transcription factor programs for a variety of cancer indications. Our strategy is to disrupt the interaction between transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes. Our initial focus is on disrupting transcription factor interactions with the BAF complex. We believe that there are over 100 transcription factors in oncology that would be amenable to this new approach. Based on these insights, we are developing small molecule disruptors that block the interaction between transcription factors and the BAF complex. In addition to applications in cancer, we believe that such disruptors could be applied in other therapeutic areas.
Our approach to disrupting the interactions between transcription factors and the BAF complex is the basis of a collaboration signed with Merck in July 2020. In this collaboration, we intend to apply our Gene Traffic Control platform to identify disruptors of a single predetermined transcription factor. As part of the collaboration, we received an upfront payment of $15.0 million, and are also eligible to receive up to $245.0 million upon achievement of specified research, development and regulatory milestones by any product candidate generated by the collaboration, and up to $165.0 million upon achievement of specified sales-based milestones.
We used our Gene Traffic Control platform to produce and purify BAF complexes and multiple transcription factors to study the structural details as well as the biochemical and biophysical properties of their interactions.
We observed that different transcription factors bind to different sites on the surface of the BAF complex. This suggests that there is specificity in these interactions. Therefore, it may be possible to block the interaction of a specific transcription factor with the BAF complex without blocking the interactions of other transcription factors.
Figure 24. Illustrative locations of the binding sites of multiple transcription factors to the BAF complex.
Using the insights of where and how tightly transcription factors bind, we have developed as part of our Gene Traffic Control platform the ability to conduct high throughput screens on chromatin remodeling complex–transcription factor interactions. We have already validated numerous BAF-transcription factor interactions for targets of interest in various cancers. We are applying our know-how to screen several of these BAF-transcription factor interactions to discover and develop transcription factor disruptors. We intend to use our platform to validate and drug additional transcription factors that interact with BAF and other chromatin remodeling complexes both in oncology and other therapeutic areas.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies and understanding of disease etiology, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe that our approach, strategy, scientific capabilities, know-how and experience provide us with competitive advantages, including, to our knowledge, our being the only company with the ability to study the chromatin regulatory system at scale, in context, and in an integrated way. However, we expect substantial competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and existing or emerging biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions worldwide. Many of our competitors, either alone or through collaborations, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies may be or may become interested in the chromatin regulatory system and rapidly develop programs that may compete with ours by studying the chromatin regulatory system at scale, in context and in an integrated way. Even if they do not advance programs with the same mechanism of action as ours, these companies could develop products or product candidates that are competitive with ours or that have a superior product profile and may do so at a rapid pace. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
We face competition from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue the development of therapies that target broad genetic expression mechanisms, including the chromatin regulatory system. In addition, we may face competition from companies developing product candidates that utilize protein degradation approaches, including Arvinas, Inc., Kymera Therapeutics, Inc., Nurix Therapeutics, Inc., and C4 Therapeutics, Inc. Further, several large pharmaceutical companies have disclosed preclinical investments in this field. Our competitors will also include companies that are or will be developing other targeted therapies, including small molecule, antibody, or protein degraders for the same indications that we are targeting including Immunocore Holdings, Plc. and IDEAYA Biosciences, Inc.
We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, are less expensive or with more favorable labeling than our product candidates, regardless of whether they target the chromatin regulatory system as a mechanism of action. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Intellectual Property
We seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including by pursuing patent applications that cover our product candidates and methods of using the same, as well as other relevant inventions and improvements that we believe to be commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. Our commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend any patents we may own or in-license in the future, prevent others from infringing any patents we may own or in-license in the future, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending provisional and PCT patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents and any issued 
patents we may obtain do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology or commercialize our product candidates. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in any patents we may own or in-license in the future. Any issued patents that we may own or in-license in the future may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or have the scope of their claims narrowed. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide.
The term of individual patents depends upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”), in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent claiming a new drug product may also be eligible for a limited patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Additionally, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. In the future, if our product candidates receive approval by the FDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on any issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical studies for each product and other factors. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from our current or future pending patent applications, or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the terms of any patents we may own or in-license in the future. In addition, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time.
As of March 1, 2023, we owned 14 pending U.S. provisional patent applications, 27 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, 9 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) applications, and 133 pending ex-U.S. patent applications. We currently do not own or in-license any issued patents with respect to any of our product candidates, including FHD-286 and FHD-609, or our platform technology, and our intellectual property portfolio is in its very early stages.
FHD-286
As of March 1, 2023, we owned two U.S. patents, four pending U.S. provisional patent applications, five pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, two pending PCT, patent applications, and 45 pending ex-U.S. patent applications that relate to FHD-286, including its composition and various methods of use. Any U.S. or ex-U.S. patent that may issue from these patent applications would be scheduled to expire between 2039-2043, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or patent term extension, if applicable.
FHD-609
As of March 1, 2023, we owned five pending U.S. provisional patent applications, four pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, three pending PCT patent application, and 24 pending ex-U.S. patent applications that relate to FHD-609, including its composition and various methods of use. Any U.S. or ex-U.S. patent that may issue from a non-provisional patent application claiming priority to these applications would be scheduled to expire between 2039-2043, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or patent term extension, if applicable.
Prosecution of most of our PCT patent applications and our provisional patent applications has not commenced and will not commence unless and until they are timely converted into U.S. non-provisional or national stage applications. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO or other foreign jurisdiction are often significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. Any of our pending PCT patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file national stage patent applications within 30 months in the countries in which we seek patent protection. If we do not timely file any national stage patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our PCT patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed 
in such PCT patent applications. Our provisional patent applications may never result in issued patents and are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing the related provisional patent application. If we do not timely file non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. While we intend to timely file non-provisional and national stage patent applications relating to our provisional and PCT patent applications, we cannot predict whether any of our current or future patent applications related to FHD-286, FHD-609, or any of our other product candidates, will issue as patents. If we do not successfully obtain patent protection, or, even if we do obtain patent protection, if the scope of the patent protection we obtain with respect to FHD-286, FHD-609, or our other product candidates or technology is not sufficiently broad, we will be unable to prevent others from using our technology or from developing or commercializing technology and products similar or identical to ours or other competing products and technologies.
In addition to patent applications, we rely on unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. In particular, we consider various aspects of our Gene Traffic Control platform to constitute our trade secrets and know-how. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors and non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We cannot guarantee that we will have executed such agreements with all applicable employees and contractors, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party or misused by any person to whom we disclose such information. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.”
License Agreement with Merck
In July 2020, we entered into the Merck Collaboration Agreement with Merck to apply our Gene Traffic Control platform to discover and develop novel therapeutics based on disruptors of a specified transcription factor target.
Under the terms of the Merck Collaboration Agreement, we are responsible for certain preclinical research activities under a mutually agreed research plan, such as the use of our high throughput screening and compound optimization technology to identify and validate disruptors directed to this transcription factor target, up until our delivery to Merck of a hit package that identifies validated disruptors directed to the transcription factor target. Merck will be responsible for further preclinical research under the Merck Collaboration Agreement and for the clinical development and commercialization of therapeutics arising from the agreement. Merck will have a limited right to substitute the transcription factor target that is the subject of the collaboration for other transcription factors.
Under the terms of the Merck Collaboration Agreement, we have granted Merck an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patent rights and know-how to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell and sell therapeutics arising from the collaboration that disrupt the specified transcription factor target.
We have received an upfront payment of $15.0 million from Merck, and are eligible to receive up to $245.0 million upon achievement of specified research, development and regulatory milestones by any product candidate generated by the collaboration, and up to $165.0 million upon achievement of specified sales-based milestones per approved product from the collaboration, if any. We will be eligible to receive tiered royalties, calculated on a product-by-product basis, on net sales of approved products from the collaboration, if any, at royalty rates ranging from the mid-single digits to low tens, depending on whether the products are covered by patent rights we license to Merck.
The Merck Collaboration Agreement will expire upon expiration of all of Merck’s royalty obligations under the agreement. Merck may terminate the Merck Collaboration Agreement for convenience, and either party may terminate the Merck Collaboration Agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach or such party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. If Merck terminates the Merck Collaboration Agreement as a result of our breach, the licenses and other rights granted to Merck under the agreement will remain in effect and become perpetual. If the term of the agreement expires, then such licenses and other rights will become fully paid-up.
Strategic Collaboration with Lilly
On December 10, 2021, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Loxo Oncology at Lilly. Under the terms of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, the parties will seek to leverage our platform technology to research, discover and develop therapeutic molecules directed to the selective BRM target and an additional undisclosed oncology target, and to three additional discovery programs. Lilly will pursue the clinical development, manufacture and commercialization of products derived from or containing certain compounds developed and Foghorn will have the right to participate in the development and commercialization of these products for the U.S. market.
Under the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, Lilly made an upfront payment of $300.0 million, and a concurrent $80.0 million equity investment in Foghorn. We are eligible to receive a share of U.S. profits for co-commercialized products. Lilly and Foghorn will share 50/50 in the U.S. economics for products directed to the BRM-selective program and one other undisclosed target. For the three Discovery Programs, Foghorn will have an option to participate in a percentage of the U.S. economics following the successful completion of dose-finding toxicity studies. For these programs, Foghorn is eligible to receive development and commercialization milestones of up to an aggregate of approximately $1.3 billion if Foghorn does not exercise its option to participate in the U.S. economics for any discovery program. In addition, Lilly will pay the Company tiered royalties on product sales on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis (1) at royalty rates ranging from low-double digits to the twenties on ex-U.S. sales for products directed to the BRM-selective program and one other undisclosed target and (2) at royalty rates ranging from mid-single digits to low-double digits on sales outside the U.S. for products directed to the Discovery Programs, during the applicable royalty term and subject to certain royalty step-down provisions.
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates undergoing preclinical testing, as well as for clinical testing and commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval.
All of our drug candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in synthetic processes from available starting materials. The chemistry appears amenable to scale up and does not currently require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of companion diagnostics for our products, which are assays or tests to identify an appropriate patient population. Depending on the technology solutions we choose, we may rely on multiple third parties to manufacture and sell a single test.
Commercialization
Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization in the United States to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. Outside the United States, we expect to enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval.
We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in ex-United States countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and ex-United States statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, where we are initially focusing our drug development, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”) as amended, its implementing regulations and other laws. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval 
or any other legal requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before our product candidates are approved as drugs for therapeutic indications and may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (“GLP”) requirements;
•completion of the manufacture, under cGMP conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”);
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA, to accept the filing for review;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•potentially, satisfactory completion of FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
•payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials for Drugs
Before testing any drug in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to United States federal and state regulation, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a full or partial clinical hold. FDA must notify the sponsor of the grounds for the hold and any identified deficiencies must be resolved before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A clinical hold can also be imposed once a trial has already begun, thereby halting the trial until the deficiencies articulated by FDA are corrected.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, who generally are physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each 
institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable compared to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subject or other grounds, such as a lack of observed efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about clinical trials, including results for clinical trials other than Phase 1 investigations, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, a clinical trials database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, FDA will nevertheless accept the results of the study in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.
•Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the drug’s potential efficacy, to determine the optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
•Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials or post-marketing studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of NDA approval.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Marketing Approval for Drugs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA package requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy for the requested indications. The marketing application is required to include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA must approve an NDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for the indications sought and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) if it believes that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS can include use of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies like medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan drug exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Expedited Development and Review Programs for Drugs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients more quickly than standard FDA review timelines typically permit.
A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed. Rolling review means that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application. In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review, once an NDA or BLA is submitted, if the drug that is the subject of the marketing application has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal date to take action on the marketing application is six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Products are eligible for Accelerated Approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or an indication approved under Accelerated Approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA generally requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. After the 120-day period has passed, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 
2022 (“FDORA”) signed by President Biden on December 29, 2022 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (H.R. 2617) includes numerous reforms to the Accelerated Approval process for drugs and biologics and enables the FDA to require, as appropriate, that a post-approval study be underway prior to granting accelerated approval. FDORA also expands the expedited withdrawal procedures already available to the FDA to allow the agency to use expedited procedures if a sponsor fails to conduct any required post-approval study of the product with due diligence including with respect to “conditions specified by the Secretary [of HHS].” FDORA also adds the failure of a sponsor of a product approved under Accelerated Approval to conduct with due diligence any required post-approval study with respect to such product or to submit timely reports with respect to such product to the list of prohibited acts in the FD&C Act.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, though they may expedite the development or review process.
Pediatric Information and Pediatric Exclusivity
The Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, as amended, certain NDAs and NDA supplements must contain data that can be used to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FD&C Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
A drug can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
U.S. Post-Approval Requirements for Drugs
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the generation of additional data or the conduct of additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements may subject a manufacturer to legal or regulatory action, such as warning 
letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information.
Companion diagnostics are designed to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In the United States, the FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”).
To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or to a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or a predicate device, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. In making a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the FDA compares the proposed device to the predicate device and assesses whether the subject device is comparable to the predicate device with respect to intended use, technology, design and other features which could affect safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer.
A PMA must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. The process for developing a PMA, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and submission to FDA can take several years or longer. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of an initial PMA is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete, and PMA approval is not guaranteed. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny the approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
On July 31, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance document, for novel therapeutic products that depend on the use of a diagnostic test and where the diagnostic device could be essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic, although the FDA recognizes that there may be cases when contemporaneous development may not be possible. However, in cases where a drug cannot be used safely or effectively without the companion diagnostic, the FDA’s guidance indicates it will generally not approve the drug without the approval or clearance of the diagnostic device. The FDA also issued a draft guidance in July 2016 setting forth the principles for co-development of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product. The draft guidance describes principles to guide the development and contemporaneous marketing authorization for the therapeutic product and its corresponding in vitro companion diagnostic.
Once cleared or approved, the companion diagnostic device must adhere to post-marketing requirements including the requirements of the FDA’s QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, and shipping of all medical devices, as well as adverse event reporting, recalls and corrections along with product marketing requirements and limitations. Medical devices, including companion diagnostics, may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. Like drug makers, companion diagnostic makers are subject to unannounced FDA inspections at any time during which the FDA will conduct an audit of the product(s) and the company’s facilities, facility records, and manufacturing processes for compliance with its authorities.
Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FD&C Act can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FD&C Act provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
The FD&C Act alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Other Healthcare Laws
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-
party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below, some of which will not apply to us unless or until we have a marketed product.
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or ordering of, a good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;
•Federal false claims, false statement and civil monetary penalties laws prohibiting, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payments of government funds or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement material to a false claim; 
•The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”),which, in addition to privacy protections applicable to healthcare providers and other entities, prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
•The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to report information related to certain payments and transfers of value provided to certain healthcare providers to CMS, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
•Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
•The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products prior to approval or for unapproved indications and regulates the distribution of samples; 
•Federal laws, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs; and
•Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback, anti-bribery and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, as well as other state laws that require companies to comply with specific compliance standards, restrict financial interactions between companies and healthcare providers, and require companies to report information related to payments to healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or pricing. 
Given the breadth of the laws and regulations, narrowness of exceptions, limited guidance for certain laws and regulations, and evolving government interpretations of the laws and regulations, ensuring compliance is challenging. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business.
Coverage and Reimbursement by Third-Party Payors
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of an approved drug product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the product. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide 
coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product therefore does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may seek to control costs and manage utilization by, for example, excluding products from lists of approved covered products (known as “formularies”), imposing step edits that require patients to try alternative treatments before authorizing payment for products, limiting the types of diagnoses for which coverage will be provided, requiring pre-approval (known as “prior authorization”) for coverage of a prescription for each patient (to allow the payor to assess medical necessity) or imposing a moratorium on coverage for products while the payor makes a coverage decision.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, which will require additional expenditure above and beyond the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Current and Future Healthcare Reform Legislation
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs.
For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Affordable Care Act”), which, among other things, expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included a number of changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. Beyond the Affordable Care Act, there have been ongoing health care reform efforts. Drug pricing and payment reform was a focus of the Trump Administration and has been a focus of the Biden Administration. For example, federal legislation enacted in 2021 eliminates a statutory cap on Medicaid drug rebate program rebates effective January 1, 2024. As another example, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) of 2022 includes a number of changes intended to address rising prescription drug prices in Medicare Parts B and D. These changes, which have varying implementation dates, include caps on Medicare Part D out-of-pocket costs, Medicare Part B and Part D drug price inflation rebates, a new Medicare Part D manufacturer discount drug program and a drug price negotiation program for certain high spend Medicare Part B and D drugs. Although the impact of the IRA remains uncertain pending implementation, the IRA is likely to have a significant effect on the healthcare industry and prescription drug pricing overall. 
Healthcare reform efforts have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. For example, with respect to the Affordable Care Act, tax reform legislation was enacted that eliminated the tax penalty established for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 and, in 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the latest judicial challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. As another example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. Pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 2032.
There have also been efforts by federal and state government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. 
Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our product candidates. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022) unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our current or future products if approved for sale. We cannot, however, predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
Other U.S. Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
Government Regulation of Drugs Outside of the United States
To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.
Data Privacy Regulations
The conduct of our clinical trials may be subject to privacy restrictions based on U.S. and non-U.S. regulations. For example, we may be subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). As currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. Additionally, the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data 
regarding individuals in the EU and the UK, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) including as it forms part of the law of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and as amended by the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/419), known as UK GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR and the UK GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. The UK’s data protection authority, the Information Commissioner’s Office, has indicated that following Brexit it will continue to enforce the UK GDPR in line with the enforcement of the GDPR in the EU. However, the UK government recently announced its intention to adopt a more flexible approach to the regulation of data, and as a result, there remains a risk of future divergence between the EU and UK data protection regimes.
