ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are an internally-managed corporation organized in the state of Maryland on November 26, 2013 focused on acquiring, owning and operating high-quality office properties located in 18-hour cities in the Southern and Western United States. Our target markets possess a number of attractive demographic and employment characteristics that we believe will lead to capital appreciation and growth in rental income at our properties. Our senior management team has extensive industry relationships and a proven track record in executing this strategy, which we believe provides a competitive advantage to our stockholders. We have elected, and intend to continue to qualify, to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 We believe that our target markets offer the opportunity for attractive risk-adjusted returns due to the following characteristics: favorable economic growth trends, growing populations with above average employment growth forecasts, a large number of government offices, large international, national and regional employers across diversified industries, low-cost centers for business operations, proximity to large universities and increasing office occupancy rates. We also believe that new construction of office properties has been limited in many of our markets since 2008 because rental rates in these markets generally have not supported significant new development. Within our target markets, we focus primarily on Class A and B properties with a purchase price between $25 million and $100 million and expected capitalization rates generally between seven and eight percent. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in acquiring these properties in our target markets because large institutional investors generally have focused on larger properties in gateway markets such as Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., while local real estate operators in our markets typically do not benefit from the same access to capital as public REITs. 
 Our senior management team has extensive experience in real estate markets and is made up of James Farrar, our chief executive officer, Gregory Tylee, our president and chief operating officer, and Anthony Maretic, our chief financial officer, each with over 20 years of experience. We internally asset manage our properties but use local firms for property management and leasing in our markets to benefit from their local market knowledge, efficient operations and existing infrastructure. 
 At December 31, 2018, we owned 64 office buildings with a total of approximately 5.7 million square feet of net rentable area (NRA) in the metropolitan areas of Dallas, Denver, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego and Tampa. We believe that our properties are high quality assets that provide excellent access to transportation options, are located near affluent neighborhoods, contain extensive amenities and are well-maintained. We also believe that our properties have a stable and diverse tenant base, including federal and state governmental agencies and national and regional businesses. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio was approximately 90.4% leased. Our properties also have a stable, long-term tenancy profile and our occupied and committed leases have staggered expirations and a weighted average remaining lease term to maturity of 4.6 years at December 31, 2018. The majority of our leases are full service gross leases pursuant to which our tenants reimburse us for operating expenses, property taxes and insurance in excess of a base amount. This structure helps insulate us from increases in certain operating expenses and provides a more predictable cash flow. Our leases typically include rent escalation provisions designed to provide annual growth in our rental income. 
 For further information on our target markets and the composition of our tenant base, see Item 2Properties. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 18 full-time employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

 Business Objectives and Growth Strategies 
 Our principal business objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term through a combination of dividends and capital appreciation. We believe the following strategies will help us achieve our business objective and continue to distinguish us from other owners and operators of office properties in our markets: 
 Acquire Properties in Our Target Markets: We seek to expand our portfolio through acquisitions of office properties primarily located in our target 18-hour cities. We believe that current economic conditions and relatively low levels of competition from institutional buyers have created attractive investment opportunities for the acquisition of office properties in our target markets as compared to gateway markets. We also use our management teams market-specific knowledge as well as the expertise of our local real estate operators and our investment partners to identify acquisitions that we believe offer cash flow stability and value enhancement.   Leverage Strong Relationships of Our Management Team: Our senior management team has extensive relationships within our markets, including with real estate owners, developers, operators and brokers. We have strong relationships with our local third-party real estate operators, which typically manage or lease a large number of properties in the submarkets and markets where our properties are located, providing economies of scale and local market insight. In addition, our management team has strong lending relationships with various banks and insurance companies. 
 Seek Contractual Rent Escalations: Our leases typically provide for contractual increases in base rental rates. These rental escalations are expected to result in predictable increases in rental revenues for us over time. We will continue to seek to include contractual rent escalators in future leases to further facilitate predictable growth in rental income.   Lease Currently Vacant Space: As of December 31, 2018, the weighted average in place occupancy rate of our properties was approximately 90.4%, and approximately 91.5% when excluding assets under contract for sale, and we believe that there is potential to generate additional rental income by leasing space in these properties that is currently unoccupied. We believe that our properties compete for tenants with other landlords that are capital constrained and may not be able to enhance their buildings appeal through capital investments or offer tenants attractive tenant improvement packages.   Implement Improvements and Cost-Saving Initiatives: We actively pursue cost reduction initiatives, such as eliminating redundant or unnecessary expenses and engaging property tax appeal specialists to lower property tax costs, and make an ongoing effort to increase expense recoveries from tenants on new and renewed leases.

 Competition 
 We compete with other REITs (both public and private), public and private real estate companies, private real estate investors and lenders, both domestic and foreign, in acquiring properties. We also face competition in leasing or subleasing available properties to prospective tenants. 
 We believe that our managements experience and relationships in, and local knowledge of, the markets in which we operate put us at a competitive advantage when seeking acquisitions. However, some of our competitors have greater resources than we do, or may have a more flexible capital structure when seeking to finance acquisitions. We also face competition in leasing or subleasing available properties to prospective tenants. Some real estate operators may be willing to enter into leases at lower contractual rental rates. However, we believe that our intensive management services are attractive to tenants and serve as a competitive advantage. 
 Segment and Geographic Financial Information 
 During 2018, we had one reportable segment, our office properties segment. For information about our office property revenues and long-lived assets and other financial information, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of Operations. 
Environmental Matters 
 A wide variety of environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect our properties. These complex laws, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these laws may directly impact us. Under various local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owners liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could reduce our revenues. 
 We believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters. We have not been notified by any governmental authority of any material non-compliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matter in connection with any of our properties.
