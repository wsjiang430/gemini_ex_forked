Item 1. Business
 
We were incorporated on December 3, 1998, in the State of Nevada, and have one wholly-owned subsidiary, Creative Medical Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“ CMT ”), which conducts all of our business operations. On September 14, 2016, we formed a limited liability company, Amniostem LLC Inc., in Nevada for the purpose of creating and/or licensing intellectual property in the area of amniotic fluid derived stem cells for therapeutic applications. This entity is a wholly owned subsidiary of CMT but has not commenced any business activities. In May 2017, we formed StemSpine, LLC (“ StemSpine ”), in Nevada for the purpose of creating and/or licensing intellectual property in the area of utilizing stem cells to treat lower back pain. This entity is a wholly owned subsidiary of CMT but has not commenced any business activities. In June 2018, we formed CaverStem International, LLC, in Nevada for the purpose of licensing the CaverStem procedure internationally. This entity is 60% owned by Creative Medical Technology Holdings, Inc. and 40% owned by Dr. Alex Gershman. It has not commenced any business activities.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 3008 W Lupine, Phoenix, AZ 85029.
 



Creative Medical Technologies
 
CMT was created as the urological arm of its parent company, Creative Medical Health, Inc. (“CMH”), to monetize the treatments or products developed or acquired by CMH prior to creation of CMT and transferred to it after its incorporation. CMT acquired a patent for its erectile dysfunction (“ ED ”) treatment from CMH. Subsequent to the transfer, CMT has expanded its development and acquisition of intellectual property beyond urology to include therapeutic treatments utilizing amniotic stem cells and treatment of neurologic disorders and lower back pain using various types of stem cells.
 
CMT is a commercial stage company and is engaged in marketing its ED treatment through the sale of disposable kits to physicians for use with their patients suffering from ED. In August 2017, CMT completed recruitment on a clinical trial being conducted at UCLA by LABIOMED. Following completion of recruitment and treatment of the study subjects, an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) overseeing the study validated the procedure as safe. In the same time frame, other peer reviewed and published clinical trials using the same procedure validated the efficacy of the ED treatment. As a result of these two developments, management concluded the ED procedure is both safe and effective and has commenced marketing activities.
 
We are engaged in stem cell research and developing applications for use to treat male sexual dysfunction, and related issues. We market our ED treatment under the name “Caverstem” to physicians for use with their patients suffering from ED. There are currently 14 locations at various stages of development, training marketing, recruiting and treating patients.
 
Erectile Dysfunction Treatment
 
On February 2, 2016, CMT entered into a Patent Purchase Agreement with CMH pursuant to which CMH assigned to CMT its rights to US Patent No. 8,372,797, entitled “Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction by Stem Cell Therapy” which was issued to CMH by the USPTO on February 12, 2013, and related know-how and technology. The closing of the Patent Purchase Agreement occurred in May 2016, and we issued 64,666,667 shares of CMT’s common stock to CMH.
 
While previous studies have demonstrated that stem cells can enhance blood vessel function, this patent application was the first to demonstrate that administration of stem cells can lead to enhanced erections. This procedure has been demonstrated safe and feasible in clinical trials.
 
Prior to the closing of the Patent Purchase Agreement, CMH was in the process of commencing clinical trial studies on the efficacy and safety of the ED stem cell treatment. As a result of the purchase of the ED patent by us, we have now taken over the clinical trial studies. The trial recruitment is completed and an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) has validated the safety of the Caverstem procedure. While our clinical trial is ongoing, other completed, peer-reviewed and published clinical trials using the same procedure validate the procedure is effective as well as safe. Given the safety and efficacy of the procedure, CMT is now engaged in marketing the technology with complete kits and training to medical doctors, who can practice the treatment for their patients.
 
The results of completed and ongoing clinical trials validate management’s conclusion that the Caverstem treatment is both safe and effective. Bone marrow stem cells have been used for over four decades in the area of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Stimulation of angiogenesis using this cell population has been performed in animal models of ischemia, as well as in clinical trials. One study used bone marrow cells that were isolated for expression of the p75 nerve growth factor receptor using magnetic activated cell sorting. They chose this population based on possible enhancement of neurogenic potential. Intracavernous administration of these cells into a rat bilateral cavernous nerve crush injury model was performed. At a four week follow up, improvement in erectile function as assessed by mean intracavernous-to-mean arterial pressure ratio and total intracavernous pressure was assessed. Significant improvements were observed in animals receiving the p75 selected cells as compared to those receiving an equal concentration of bone marrow derived multipotent stromal cells, fibroblasts, or saline. Significantly higher levels of FGF-2 were found in the cavernosum of animals receiving the p75 selected cells.
 
Clinical use of stem cells in treatment of ED has been reported in a study outside the U.S. which treated seven patients with diabetes associated ED which was unresponsive to medication for at least six months with an average of 1.5 × 10(7) cord blood mononuclear cells injected intracavernously. Three additional patients with similar characteristics were used as controls. No treatment associated abnormalities were reported despite the allogeneic nature of the cells in absence of immune suppression. One month after treatment, morning erections were regained in three participants. By the third month post treatment six of the seven patients had regained morning erections. In all patients rigidity increased as the result of cord blood administration, but was not sufficient for penetration. When the patients were administered PDE5 inhibitor before coitus, two achieved penetration and experienced orgasm, and maintained for more than six months; however, one participant could not achieve penetration at ninth month. An increase in sexual desire was reported in six of the seven patients. No improvements were observed in any of the three control patients.
 
Female Sexual Function Treatment
 
In September 2018, the Company launched the proprietary FemCelz procedure for the treatment of the loss of genital sensitivity and dryness. 30% of the women in the US suffer from a loss a genital sensitivity and/or dryness. The procedure uses the patients own stem cells to improve female sexual function. The procedure is performed by a licensed physician in their office. FemCelz was developed by the Company and has many similarities to the CaverStem procedure for men.
 
Procedures for use of our FemCelz stem cell treatment consist of a one-hour out-patient visit in a physician’s office. The physician harvests a patient’s stem cells from the hip using a local anesthetic. The separated and cleansed stem cells are then injected into the patient’s pubocervical fascia (peri-G-spot), skene’s glands, and around the peri-clitoral to stimulate muscle and generate blood vessel regeneration.

Evidence from European clinical trials also confirm the safety and effectiveness of this procedure. At the Henri Mondor Teaching Hospital, located in Créteil, France a clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of intracavernous autologous BM-MNC injection to treat pRP-ED (NCT01089387). Twelve patients with localized prostate cancer and vasculogenic pRP-ED refractory to maximal medical treatment were divided into four equal groups treated with escalating BM-MNC doses (2×10(7), 2×10(8), 1×10(9), 2×10(9)). Tolerance was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were the effects on erectile function and penile vascularization at 6 mo, as assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function-15 and Erection Hardness Scale questionnaires, and color duplex Doppler ultrasound. The peak systolic velocity was measured in the cavernous arteries and assessed endothelial function using the penile nitric oxide release test. No serious side effects occurred. At 6 mo versus baseline, significant improvements of intercourse satisfaction (6.8±3.6, 3.9±2.5, p=0.044) and erectile function (17.4±8.9, 7.3±4.5, p=0.006) domains of the International Index of Erectile Function-15 and Erection Hardness Scale (2.6±1.1, 1.3±0.8, p=0.008) were observed in the total population. Spontaneous erections showed significantly greater improvement with the higher doses. Clinical benefits were associated with improvement of peak systolic velocity and of % penile nitric oxide release test and sustained after 1 yr. In 2013, Dr. Thomas Ichim, one of our directors, conducted a pilot study on a single subject where a total of 60 ml of bone marrow aspirate was obtained and processed in a closed-system concentration device. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were concentrated to a volume of 2 ml, with 1 ml administered into each side of the smooth muscle of the penis using a 25 gauge syringe. A tourniquet was placed around the base of the penis during the injection procedure and held for five minutes to allow for maximal retention. No immediate injection-associated adverse events were noted. The patient reported a morning erection two days after cell administration. Although blood vessel and smooth muscle growth could not occur during this short time period, the possibility of bone marrow released nitric oxide stimulating erections via vasodilation may be postulated. Three weeks after treatment, the patient reported erection strong enough for penetration, but did not have ability to sustain the erection until orgasm. At three month follow-up the patient reported having intercourse until orgasm several times and a marked increase in morning erections. No adverse effects or ectopic tissue formation was observed.
 
CMH entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement dated May 18, 2015, with LABIOMED and conducted by Dr. Jacob Rajfer with UCLA Harbor Hospital as its principal investigator. An IRB (Institutional Review Board) application was submitted and approved. The purpose of the clinical trials is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ED stem cell treatment. Enrollment in the clinical trials began in December 2015, the clinical trial began during first quarter 2016 with enrollment in the trial completed in August 2017. Following the completion of enrollment and treatment of 25 subjects, the IRB concluded there were no adverse events as a result of the procedure. Thereby concluding the procedure is safe. The primary outcome measures for these clinical trials include the following: (i) improvement in erectile function as measured by total score in the International Index of Erectile Function; (ii) change in Doppler Ultrasound (papaverine induced color duplex Doppler) for evaluating blood flow; (iii) change in dynamic infusion cavernosometry that measures veno-occlusive pressure, each of which should require approximately six months from baseline; and (iv) adverse events, which should require approximately 12 months from baseline. The secondary outcome measures include improvement in erectile function as measured by total score in the International Index of Erectile Function, which should require approximately 12 months from baseline. Under the terms of the Patent Purchase Agreement, CMH assigned these agreements to us and we have assumed the duties and obligations under these agreements. The patients on the trial have received the procedure, follow-up is complete and the results are being analyzed in preparation for publishing the findings.
 
Procedures for use of our ED stem cell treatment consist of a one-hour out-patient visit in a physician’s office. The physician harvests a patient’s stem cells from the hip using a local anesthetic. The separated and cleansed stem cells are then injected into the patient’s venus cavernosa to stimulate muscle and generate blood vessel regeneration. Clinical research data concludes that such treatment results in a marked increase in duration and frequency of erections and the ability to sustain erections until orgasm, with no known treatment-associated adverse events.
 
In October 2017, based on the safety data from the UCLA trial and peer-reviewed, published results of other clinical trials using the same process, we proceeded with commercialization of the ED procedure. In December 2017, we recruited Dr. Alexander Gershman, Director of The Institute of Advanced Urology at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Tower; Director of Urologic Laparoscopy in the Division of Urology, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center a leading urologists in the Southwestern United States to perform the CaverstemTM procedure to treat erectile dysfunction in patients who do not respond to currently available treatments. In that same month, Dr. Gershman began treating patients with the procedure, which involves extraction of a small amount of bone marrow mesenchymal cells, and subsequent administration to the patient within less than 60 minutes.
 
We also are progressing with the CaverStem™ program in Italy, Russia, and other EU countries. Setting up such relationships and navigating all legal obligations to conduct business in each country takes a great deal of effort and time on the part of CaverStem™ executives and our counterparts in each medical practice.
 
Lower Back Pain Treatment
 
In May 2017, we formed StemSpine, LLC (“ StemSpine ”), a Nevada limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Creative Medical Technologies, Inc. (“ CMT ”), for the purpose of using stem cells to treat back pain. StemSpine then entered into a Patent Purchase Agreement dated May 17, 2017, with Creative Medical Holdings, Inc. (“ CMH ”). Under the terms of the Agreement, StemSpine acquired U.S. Patent No. 9,598,673 covering use of various stem cells for treatment of lower back pain. In June 2017, StemSpine filed an additional patent application covering synergy between intradiscal stem cell injection subsequent to stimulation of perispinal angiogenesis.

Lower back pain is the single leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting mobility, functionality and the emotional state. To date, treatment options have ranged from prescription medication, to physical therapy and even acupuncture. Unfortunately, in patients whose lower back pain originates from disc degeneration, existing approved treatments do not address the underlying cause, but only symptoms.
 
Recent U.S. clinical trials using stem cells administered directly into the disc have shown promise in regenerating injured discs, and by this means reducing pain in some patients. Companies such as Mesoblast Limited and BioRestorative Therapeutics have patient follow-ups as long as three years post injection and show some degree of pain reduction and disc regeneration without adverse effects.
 
It is known that a significant number of patients suffering from lower back pain have deficient circulation in the areas surrounding the discs, which is believed by some to be the initial cause of disc degeneration. The technology developed and patented by Stemspine, LLC utilizes biologicals to stimulate a process termed angiogenesis, which overcomes the deficient circulation causing disc degeneration.
 
Multipotent Amniotic Fetal Stem Cells
 
On August 25, 2016, CMT entered into a License Agreement which grants us the exclusive right to all products derived from US Patent No. 7,569,385 for multipotent amniotic fetal stem cells. This patent covers methods for identifying, isolating, expanding and differentiating a novel population of therapeutic stem cells, specifically, stem cells derived from amniotic fluid. In the scope of available stem cell technologies, this invention describes compositions of fetal-derived stem cells and methods for generating these cells that can allow for tissue regeneration without raising the ethical concerns that are inherent to embryonic/fetal-derived cell types. The source of these stem cells is amniotic fluid harvested during routine amniocentesis of pregnant women, whereby the isolated cell population is subsequently cultured and expanded to create a bank of therapeutic stem cells.
 
In February 2017, the company expanded its translational research program using its AmnioStem universal donor stem cell product through establishment of laboratory facilities in San Diego. The Company initiated research activities at the San Diego BioLabs facility, a biotechnology incubator sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Companies, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis, and Sanofi. During 2018, the company completed its initial research activities at BioLabs and is continuing to gather animal data in support of an Innovative New Drug (IND) filing with the FDA.
 
Multipotent Amniotic Fetal Stem Cells for Stroke Therapy
 
On Dec. 13, 2016, CMT filed US patent application #62/400557 entitled “Treatment of Stroke by Amniotic Fluid Derived Stem Cell Conditioned Media and Products Derived Thereof.”. The patent application covers the use of our licensed AmnioStem stem cell as a production means for generation of nanoparticles termed “exosomes,” which regenerate damaged brain tissue after stroke. This novel stem cell-based therapeutic option by using products derived from stem cells as opposed to the stem cells themselves. The patent provides means of leveraging growth factors and nucleic acids generated by AmnioStem stem cells, in order to provide a “drug like” product that overcomes many of the hurdles associated with administration of stem cells. It is known that intravenous injection of stem cells usually results in accumulation in lungs, leading to reduced therapeutic efficacy. Concentrating and purifying regenerative factors produced by this unique stem cell type will accelerate development of this novel therapy, as well as develop combination therapies to provide the highest probability of success to patients suffering from this debilitating condition. We plan to develop both the AmnioStem cell and the stroke treatment technologies as a new regenerative medicine platform for use with multiple indications.
Multipotent Amniotic Fetal Stem Cells for Radiation Toxicity
 
In April 2017 we filed a patent application covering the use of its AmnioStem Universal Donor stem cell product as a treatment of radiation toxicity. We plan to leverage the ability of its amniotic fluid-based stem cell product to induce a process termed “neurogenesis” in which specific areas of the brain are activated to repair damaged tissue. The company partnered with Santosh Kesari, MD, PhD, FANA, FAAN who coauthored the patent. Dr. Kesari is Chair and Professor, Department of Translational Neurosciences and Neurotherapeutics, John Wayne Cancer Institute, as well as Director of Neuro-oncology, Providence Saint John's Health Center and leads the Pacific Neuroscience Research Center at Pacific Neuroscience Institute. Numerous research data support superior effects of the AmnioStem stem cell product in comparison to other stem cell types in terms of growth factor production, regenerative activity and lower cost of manufacturing. In the situation of radiation countermeasures, this product falls under the FDA ‘animal rule’, which allows for FDA clearance on the basis of studies in two validated animal models. This potentially creates a rapid path to market positions and for collaboration and funding from agencies such as BARDA which have previously supported stem cell companies for radiation production. We plan to work with Dr. Kesari to launch an investigator-initiated study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using AmnioStem to treat Radiation Toxicity.

Multipotent Amniotic Fetal Stem Cells for Selectively Inhibiting Growth of Glioma Brain Cancer Cells.
 
In July 2017, we announced preclinical data showing exosomes harvested from its patented AmnioStem amniotic fluid stem cell, selectively inhibit growth of glioma brain cancer cells. Exosomes are nanoparticles generated by a variety of cells that are critically involved in intercellular communication. This technology represents a non-toxic biological approach that eventually may provide benefit patients with brain cancer. We have partnered with Santosh Kesari, MD, Ph.D, FANA, FAAN, Chair and Professor, Department of Translational Neurosciences and Neurotherapeutics, John Wayne Cancer Institute, as well as Director of Neuro-oncology, Providence Saint John’s Health Center and leads the Pacific Neuroscience Research Center at Pacific Neuroscience Institute to co-develop this technology. From a commercialization perspective, exosomes are simpler to manufacture, store, and deliver as compared to living cells. Additionally, since exosomes are not replicating cells, we anticipate a less complicated FDA regulatory pathway as compared to cellular based products.
Marketing
 
The first product we are marketing is the treatment for ED, which was initiated in November 2017. We are implementing a multifaceted marketing approach. To that end, we entered six markets in Los Angeles California, San Francisco California, Phoenix Arizona, Orlando Florida, Las Cruces New Mexico and Honolulu, Hawaii. There are currently fourteen clinics providing the CaverstemTM procedure across the five markets we entered in 2018. In each of those markets, we provide full marketing support to the physicians through our branded Caverstem web page, advanced patient recruitment services through our PatientGain online patient recruitment platform, in-office flyers, informative videos and online advertising. In addition to direct marketing with our physician partners, we exhibit at industry conferences across the country. Going forward, we are continuing to partner with independent sales representatives who represent the company to physicians across the United States.
Intellectual Property
 
ED Patent. CMH acquired the use patent application for treatment of ED by stem cell therapy in July 2011 and prosecuted the application until the ED patent was issued in 2013. We have closed a Patent Purchase Agreement dated February 2, 2016, with CMH to acquire the ED patent and related know-how and technology for 64,666,667 shares of our common stock. The assignment documents have been filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
Lower Back Pain Patent. StemSpine, LLC acquired U.S. Patent No. 9,598,673 covering use of various stem cells for treatment of lower back pain (the “ Patent ”). The inventors of the patent were Thomas Ichim, PhD and Amit Patel, MD, each a director of the Company, CMT, and CMH, and Annette Marleau, PhD. The managers of StemSpine are Timothy Warbington, Donald Dickerson, and CMH. The patent was issued on March 21, 2017.
 
Immune System Cells for Stimulation of Perispinal Angiogenesis Application. The two patent applications, No. 62520773 and No. 62513670, filed on June 16, 2017 and June 1,, 2017, respectively, cover the novel use of cells, conventionally known as immune system cells, to stimulate formation of new blood vessels, a process termed angiogenesis. Several studies support the notion that patients suffering from lower back pain exhibit a reduction in blood flow to the lower back area. The Company has data supporting the use of immune cells from both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system for stimulation of new blood vessel formation, which is believed to be beneficial for overcoming circulation defects in patients with lower back pain.
 
Multipotent Amniotic Fetal Stem Cells License Agreement. On August 25, 2016, CMT entered into a License Agreement dated August 25, 2016, with The Regents of The University of California, represented by its San Diego campus of the University of California, San Diego, Office of Innovation and Commercialization. This license agreement grants to CMT the exclusive right to all products derived from U.S. Patent No. 7,569,385 for use of multipotent amniotic fetal stem cells composition of matter throughout the world during the period ending on the expiration date of the longest-lived patent rights under the patent. The license agreement also permits CMT to grant sublicenses. Under the terms of the license agreement, CMT is required to diligently develop, manufacture, and sell any products licensed under the agreement. We were required to pay the University an initial license fee within 30 days of entering into the agreement. We are also required to pay annual license maintenance fees on each anniversary date of the agreement, which maintenance fees would be credited toward any earned royalties for any given period. The License Agreement provides for payment of various milestone payments, which in the aggregate are estimated at approximately $2,000,000, and earned royalties on the net sales of licensed products by CMT or any sublicensee of between approximately 5% and 20%. CMT is also required to reimburse the University for any future costs associated with maintaining the patent. CMT may terminate the license agreement for any reason upon 90 days’ written notice and the University may terminate the agreement in the event CMT fails to meet its obligations set forth therein, unless the breach is cured within 30 days of the notice from the University specifying the breach. CMT is also obligated to indemnify the University against claims arising due to the exercise of the license by CMT or any sublicensee. CMT is also required to maintain adequate general liability insurance.
Multipotent Amniotic Fetal Stem Cells for Stroke Therapy Application. On Dec. 13, 2016 CMT filed US patent application #62/400557 entitled “Treatment of Stroke by Amniotic Fluid Derived Stem Cell Conditioned Media and Products Derived Thereof.”.

Multipotent Amniotic Fetal Stem Cells for Radiation Toxicity Application. On April 4, 2017, CMT filed a US patent application covering the use of its AmnioStem Universal Donor stem cell product as a treatment of radiation toxicity. We plan to leverage the ability of its amniotic fluid based stem cell product to induce a process termed “neurogenesis” in which specific areas of the brain are activated to repair damaged tissue.
AmnioStem™ Mediated Immune Reprogramming for Stroke Application. On May 24, 2017, CMT filed a US patent application covering a novel means of suppressing inflammation associated with stroke by reprogramming immune cells of the stroke victim. The patent application teaches ways of using the Company’s patented AmnioStem™ allogeneic stem cell to ‘educate’ immune cells from stroke patients so as to reduce inflammation associated with stroke. By reducing inflammation, the Company plans to develop novel means of increasing efficacy of therapeutic agents in stroke patients.
 
Synergy between intradiscal stem cell injection subsequent to stimulation of perispinal angiogenesis. On June 7, 2017 we filed a US patent application covering synergy between intradiscal stem cell injection subsequent to stimulation of perispinal angiogenesis. This patent expands on the Company’s issued US Patent No. 9,598,673, which covers treatment of lower back pain by injection of stem cells into muscles surrounding the lower back to stimulate new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis). Nutrition of the avascular intervertebral disc occurs by diffusion through the vertebral endplates from the blood vessels in the vertebral bodies above and below the disc. In many patients with lower back pain, cholesterol plaques in the wall of the aorta obliterate orifices of lumbar and middle sacral arteries and decrease blood supply of the lumbar spine and its surrounding structures. As a result, structures with precarious nutrient supply, such as the intervertebral discs, gradually degenerate. We plan to employ the new technology to modify the environment in the disc, so as to give the injected stem cells optimal conditions for regeneration
 
Immune Modulatory Cells for Stimulation of Perispinal Angiogenesis to Induce Regeneration of Degenerated Discs. On June 24, 2017 we announced the filing of intellectual property covering data supporting the use of immune system cells for stimulation of perispinal angiogenesis as a means of treating patients with lower back pain, as well as supporting intradiscal stem cell administration in patients suffering from degenerative disc disease. The two patent applications, No. 62520773 and No. 62513670, filed on June 16th and June 1st, respectively, cover the novel use of cells, conventionally known as immune system cells, to stimulate formation of new blood vessels, a process termed angiogenesis.
Autologous Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells as a Substrate for Enhancement of Neuroregenerative Therapy Application. On October 11, 2017, CMT filed a US patent application covering the use of a combination of an FDA approved drug together with the patient’s own bone marrow derived stem cells for the treatment of stroke. The patent covers the use of the patient’s bone marrow stem cells, together with an FDA approved drug, to stimulate the naturally occurring regenerative processes after certain types of strokes. We plan to we augment the naturally occurring approach by extracting stem cells from the bone marrow, placing them in circulation, and administering an FDA approved drug to enhance their activity
Male Infertility License Agreement. Effective January 29, 2016, we entered into a License Agreement with LABIOMED granting us an exclusive license in the U.S. and its territories and possessions to make and market products or services authorized under LABIOMED’s U.S. use Patent Application 14/508,763 (filed October 7, 2014, and claiming priority back to U.S. Ser. No. 60/790,085 filed on 4/7/2006). We also have the right, with LABIOMED’s consent, to grant sublicenses. Subject to early termination provisions, the license agreement expires on the last to expire of the patents under which the license was granted. We have the right to terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice. LABIOMED has the right to terminate the agreement upon the breach of certain covenants under the agreement, including the failure to make required payments to LABIOMED, failure to obtain and maintain required insurance coverage, our failure to meet performance milestones, our insolvency or bankruptcy, underreporting or underpayment of royalties in excess of 20% for any 12-month period, our challenge to the patent rights underlying the license, or our default in the performance of any obligations under the agreement not cured within 90 days following receipt of notice. The agreement obligates us to use our commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products and to initiate human clinical trials within specified times.

Government Regulation
 
Human cells, tissues or cellular or tissue-based products (“ HCT/Ps ”) intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion or transfer into a human recipient are regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration (the “ FDA ”) under the authority of section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (the “ PHSA ”) Act under which the FDA established regulations for HCT/Ps to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases. Specifically, Section 361 states that “human cells, tissues, and cellular or tissue-based products” (HCT/Ps) are regulated solely under this section if it meets all of the following criteria: (i) minimally manipulated; (ii) for homologous use only; (iii) do not involve the combination of the cells or tissues with another articles; and (iv) are for autologous use. The FDA has recently published final guidance to the industry (Same Surgical Procedure Exception under 21 CFR 1271.15(b) November 2017) that further clarifies the FDA’s position on what constitutes homologous use of HCT/Ps. The FDA in this guidance states, for the exception in 21 CFR 1271.15(b) to apply an establishment must; a) Remove and implant the HCT/Ps into the same individual from whom they were removed (autologous use); b) Implant the HCT/Ps within the same surgical procedure; and c) HCT/Ps remain in their original form, which means that they are only rinsed, cleaned, sized, or shaped in the procedure. Management believes that its stem cell treatments for ED meets the criteria for inclusion under 21 CFR 1271.15(b).
 
If the FDA were to modify its regulations or significantly change their guidance, the products mentioned above would be subject to traditional premarket and post-market requirements arising under section 351 of the PHSA Act. “351 HCT/Ps” require approval of a Biologic License Application, and their manufacture must comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“ GMPs ”). This would extend the research and development timelines on these products from three years to seven to ten years. Additionally, significantly greater capital resources would be required to complete the efforts.
 
Management expects and plans to pursue the regulatory pathway consistent with a new biological drug for our Amniotic stem cell, stroke, glioma, and radiation toxicity. As such, we will fall under the jurisdiction of CBER. This organization regulates products under a variety of regulatory authorities including the Public Health Service Act and the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. CBER manages the BLA process which is a request for permission to introduce, or deliver for introduction, a biologic product into interstate commerce (21 CFR 601.2). This process validates safety and efficacy through animal studies, first-in-human (Phase I), Safety and initial efficacy (Phase II) and pivotal trials (Phase III).
 
Competition
 
There are a number of public and private companies engaged in stem cell research and applications for use to treat ED, lower back pain, stroke and other issues. Many of these have been engaged in this field for a significant period.

In the ED marketplace there are a few private companies engaged in stem cell research and applications. This research and the possible treatments are aimed at the approximately 9,000,000 men in the U.S. who, due to damage to the blood vessels and smooth muscle tissue in the penis, do not respond to PDE5 inhibitors such as Viagra or Cialis, do not respond to or cannot tolerate penis injections containing Alprostadil such as Averject or Edex, or are not one of approximately 25,000 men in the U.S. who elect invasive, non-reversible rod or pump implantation into the penis. Currently, management’s research has determined that there are fewer than a dozen private clinics in the U.S. that offer stem cell treatments for ED. None of these firms is believed to have filed for patent protection or conducted clinical trials using bone marrow to validate safety and efficacy. By comparison, we are conducting an IRB-approved clinical trial with a leading research institution, performed by an accomplished researcher that has validated the safety of the procedure, have leveraged international clinical trials to validate efficacy and have patent protection on the procedure. Management believes that the combination of patent protection, a validated “standard of care” procedure, and competitively priced equipment and disposable kits will allow the Company to compete successfully in this marketplace.
 
In the marketplaces for lower back pain, stroke, radiation toxicity, and glioma, management believes little competition exists. While there is a significant body of academic research in vitro and in animal models on the benefits of treating lower back pain, stroke, radiation toxicity, and glioma with stem cells, management is not aware of any public or private U.S. firms pursuing human research or commercialization of these treatments. Based upon management’s research, there are fewer than five private clinics in the U.S. that offer any form of stem cell treatment for these indications. Therefore, it is management’s expectation that we will be the first entrant in the market space upon completion of our research and commercialization efforts.
