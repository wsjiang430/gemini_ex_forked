Overview
We are a preclinical biotechnology company developing next-generation cell and gene therapies engineered with our gene circuit platform technologies to fight challenging diseases. Our mission is to create a new generation of smarter medicines that outmaneuver complex diseases using novel and unprecedented approaches. To accomplish this mission, we have built a synthetic biology platform that we believe may enable us to program next-generation cell and gene therapies with what we refer to as “gene circuits.” These gene circuits, which we created from novel and proprietary combinations of genetic parts, are designed to reprogram cells with biological logic to sense inputs, compute decisions and respond to their respective cellular environments. We aim to design and optimize gene circuits and to improve the “intelligence” of cell and gene therapies in order to enhance their therapeutic effectiveness against a broad range of diseases that conventional medicines are unable to address. Our gene circuit platform technologies are designed to be applied in a modality-agnostic manner, with applicability to natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), stem cells including induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs), in vivo gene therapy, such as adeno associated virus (AAV), and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). 
Our internal pipeline is focused on using these gene circuits we engineer onto off-the-shelf healthy adult donor derived NK cells to create chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells to potentially address the high unmet need in multiple oncology indications. All of our current product candidates are in preclinical development. We expect to file an investigational new drug application, or IND, for our lead product candidate SENTI-202 in the second half of 2023.
Key Challenges to Existing Disease Treatments and Our Gene Circuit Solutions
Key Challenges to Existing Disease Treatments
Diseases often involve complex biological interactions, which limit the effectiveness of existing therapeutics that have single mechanisms of action and are unable to adapt to dynamic disease states. We characterize these key challenges in the following four categories:

Disease Evasion: Disease pathologies are multifaceted. For example, diseases can evade the immune system or acquire resistance to single-target treatments by activating other biological pathways. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of many solid tumors suppresses cancer-fighting immune cells via multiple pathways. A gene or cell therapy with the ability to activate multiple anti-tumor pathways within a single product could help limit disease evasion and may improve the durability of responses to treatment. 
Target Heterogeneity: Many diseases are heterogeneous and express antigens that are also present on healthy cells. The overlap of antigen expression on diseased and healthy cells limits the ability of existing therapies to target diseased cells at therapeutically relevant doses due to undesirable effects against healthy cells. For example, most cancers do not have a single antigen target that is uniformly expressed on all cancer cells with limited to no expression on non-cancerous cells. Thus, the ability to precisely distinguish between diseased cells and healthy cells has been a central challenge to date with current therapeutic approaches that do not encode logic, such as monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates and single-target CAR therapies. Modalities that can respond to multiple biomarkers, rather than just a single one, have the potential to open up the opportunity for more precise and efficacious medicines.


Narrow Therapeutic Window: Once administered to a patient, conventional medicines, including cell and gene therapies, cannot be tuned up or down, which makes it difficult to find the optimal dose, especially for diseases that have a narrow therapeutic window. The ability to create therapeutics that can be titrated or regulated in vivo in the patient may lead to enhanced efficacy and safety. 
Dynamic Disease Conditions: Disease conditions are dynamic and vary in space and time. For example, diseases may manifest only in certain tissues, or have a waxing and waning progression over time. Conventional therapies (i) are static, (ii) have a predefined activity around a single mechanism of action that cannot be modified post-administration and (iii) do not adapt to these dynamic conditions, thus limiting their efficacy, specificity and safety. For example, current cell and gene therapies are not dynamic or highly specific, thus limiting the indications that they can address. Developing dynamic therapeutics that are able to sense, and respond to, these spatially or temporally varying conditions would address this challenge.

Our Gene Circuit Solutions
In our pursuit to create a new generation of smarter medicines, we have built a toolbox of proprietary gene circuit platform technologies that we believe may enhance the risk benefit paradigm of cell and gene therapy products. Four core categories of gene circuits comprise our gene circuit platform: Multi-Arming, Logic Gating, Regulator Dials and Smart Sensors. Each of our gene circuit platform technologies is designed to confer greater clinical and therapeutic activity, precision and control to cell and gene therapies.
We believe that our core gene circuit platform technologies may enable us to engineer smarter medicines. These technologies can be categorized as follows:

Multi-Arming: Multi-Arming gene circuits are designed to incorporate multiple payloads into a single cell or gene therapy product. These gene circuits are intended to activate various biological pathways in complementary ways to prevent diseases from evading single-target treatments, and thereby potentially improve treatment efficacy. Existing combination therapies that target complex diseases require the application of multiple individual drugs, which is difficult due to research, clinical development, regulatory and pharmacology barriers.
Logic Gating: Logic Gating gene circuits are designed to enable cell and gene therapies to control their therapeutic activity in response to the presence or absence of multiple disease biomarkers. Below are examples of Logic Gates applied to cancer, although Logic Gating may also be applied to various other disease indications. 


 | NOT GATE: NOT GATE gene circuits are designed to widen the therapeutic window by enabling effective killing of cancer cells while preserving healthy cells. The NOT GATE functions by recognizing Protective Antigens (PAs), or antigens that are selectively expressed on healthy cells and not on cancer cells, thus limiting on-target, off-tumor killing. By protecting healthy cells, the NOT GATE has the potential to enable more effective on-target, on-tumor killing of tumor cells that express Tumor- Associated Antigens (TAAs). Generally, existing cancer drugs target only a single antigen, which means they can only be effectively and safely used in situations where that antigen is uniquely expressed on tumors and not in healthy cells, or where the on- target, off-tumor effects are tolerable.
 | OR GATE: OR GATE gene circuits are designed to address tumor heterogeneity and limit antigen escape. The OR GATE functions by killing tumor cells that express any one of multiple antigens. Generally, current medicines are unable to address more than one target at a time and are thus susceptible to tumor evasion. 
Regulator Dial: Regulator Dial gene circuits are designed to enable the precise tuning of therapeutic activity from a cell or gene therapy product. For example, this can be implemented by regulating therapeutic payload expression in response to varying concentrations of FDA-approved drugs. Regulator Dials are expected to enable the exogenous regulation of next-generation cell and gene therapies even after they have been delivered in vivo. Existing cell and gene therapies cannot be modulated once they have been delivered into patients.
Smart Sensor: A Smart Sensor is a gene circuit, or combination of gene circuits, designed to precisely detect distinct cell types or disease environments, and thus distinguish between the “disease state” and “healthy state.” For example, Smart Sensors can be engineered to detect whether certain conditions, or disease biomarkers, are present before responding with a specific therapeutic response. Conventional medicines are generally unable to dynamically change their behavior in response to cell or disease specific conditions. 

The rationale behind each gene circuit technology is explained in detail below:
 Multi-Arming
Multi-Arming gene circuits are designed to incorporate multiple payloads into a single cell or gene therapy product. These gene circuits are intended to activate various biological pathways in complementary ways to prevent diseases from evading single-target treatments, and thereby improve treatment efficacy. Existing combination therapies that target complex diseases require the application of multiple individual drugs, which is difficult due to research, clinical development, regulatory and pharmacology barriers.
Background: The Need for Targeting Multiple Biological Pathways
Many diseases are difficult to treat because they result from the dysfunction of numerous biological pathways, or they evolve strategies to evade single-target therapies. Combination therapies involving multiple distinct drugs are being used to tackle this problem, but manufacturing, developing and delivering multiple individual drugs into the body is challenging.
Our Gene Circuit Solution: Multi-Arming
We believe our Multi-Arming gene circuits can be used to create a single cell or gene therapy product candidate that includes multiple payloads capable of combating multiple disease pathways more effectively. Multi-Arming gene circuits can be controlled by any of our other gene circuit technologies, including Regulator Dials, Logic Gates and Smart Sensors, to achieve conditional therapeutic activity.
Our Calibrated Release (cr) Technology
Cytokines and other immune stimulatory proteins may be useful in overcoming the immunosuppressive TME in solid tumors by activating endogenous anti-tumor immune cells and to provide support for adoptive cell therapies. 
However, traditional approaches to use cytokines in combination with adoptive cell therapies have relied on systemic injection of cytokines or engineering the cell therapies themselves to secrete the cytokines or to display them on the cell surface. Systemic injection of cytokines has been challenging due to poor tumor penetration and the risk of systemic immune toxicity. Engineering cell therapies to secrete cytokines has the potential to activate endogenous immune cells, but these secreted cytokines may not provide optimal stimulation of the cell therapies themselves. Engineering cell therapies to display cytokines on the cell surface can stimulate the cell therapies themselves, but may not provide optimal activation of endogenous immune cells.
To overcome these limitations, we have created a novel engineered protein technology called calibrated release (cr). Our cr engineered cytokines are engineered with a designed protease cleavage site. These cr cytokines are expressed by our engineered cells and are released from the cell in a calibrated fashion via a protease ubiquitously expressed by the cell, wherein the release rate is calibrated by engineering modifications to the protease cleavage site. We believe this platform is translatable to various proteins, including IL-15 and IL-12.
We are using this approach to optimize IL-15 in our CAR–NK product candidates to simultaneously stimulate surrounding immune cells and promote CAR-NK cell expansion, persistence, and tumor killing. 
As shown in the figure below, crIL-15 is functional when cleaved and released into the supernatant, resulting in activation of pSTAT5 signaling in T cells from resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells or PBMCs. In the left panel below, comparable pSTAT5 induction was observed in T cells exposed to supernatant from engineered CAR-NK cells that expressed either crIL-15 or recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15), demonstrating benefits of crIL-15 in activating other immune cells.
Furthermore, in the right panel, crIL-15 was shown to improve serials cancer cell killing with a 3-round serial killing assay. Our engineered SENTI CAR-NK cells armed with our crIL-15 or with rhIL-15, or unengineered NK cells were co-cultured with tumor cells, which were added at hour 0, hour 96, and hour 168, to repeatedly challenge the effector cells with new cancer target cells. While all three NK cells showed tumor cell killing at the first challenge, crIL-15 engineered CAR-NK cells retained cancer cell killing even at the third challenge in contrast to the remaining two conditions. We believe this data shows the potential of our calibrated release technology platform to functionally enhance the killing activity of CAR-NK cells in challenging conditions.
Additionally, incorporating our proprietary crIL-15 onto our CAR-NK cells resulted in prolonged persistence, and increased viability and cell count in vitro compared to unengineered NK cells (viable cells detected for 3 weeks in vitro with crIL-15 CAR-NK vs < 1 week for unengineered NK cells).
We are also leveraging our calibrated release technology for other cytokines, such as IL-12, where crIL-12 expression is modulated using a small molecule Regulator Dial gene circuit to control crIL-12 expression levels, with the goal of stimulating the immune system and overcome the challenges of immunosuppressive TME while potentially avoiding safety issues.
 Logic Gating
Logic Gating gene circuits are designed to enable cell and gene therapies to control their therapeutic activity in response to the presence or absence of multiple disease biomarkers. This capability has the potential to enable more accurate and efficient targeting of heterogeneous diseased cells while sparing healthy ones. Our initial product candidates for oncology will utilize our NOT GATE and OR GATE gene circuit technology. Furthermore, we believe this technology can be utilized across a broad range of oncology indications. To this end, we have established a proprietary Tumor-Associated Antigen, or TAA, and Protective Antigen, or PA, Paired Discovery Platform as detailed later in the Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen Paired Discovery Platform section to enable the expansion of our Logic Gating approach against novel Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen pairs across multiple cancer indications.
 NOT GATE
Background: The Need for Precision Targeting
The expression of a single CAR in T cells or NK cells can redirect them to kill cancer cells that express a specific surface antigen. This technology has led to breakthrough therapies for B cell malignancies and multiple myeloma, where targeting of tissue-lineage antigens – CD19 or B Cell Maturation Antigen, or BCMA – rather than Tumor-Associated Antigens, is tolerated. Beyond these initial applications, the lack of uniquely specific tumor antigens presents a great challenge because on-target, off-tumor toxicity to vital tissues significantly limits the cancer indications addressable by single-target CAR-NK or CAR-T therapies. Similar limitations are faced by monoclonal antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates that rely on a single target to distinguish cancer cells from healthy ones.
Our Logic Gating Solution: NOT GATE
The application of CAR-immune cells may be broadened to many cancer types if recognition of a Protective Antigen that is selectively expressed on healthy cells, but not on cancer cells, could selectively block killing against the healthy cells. We believe this feature enables a widened therapeutic window and aggressive treatment of cancers with the potential for enhanced efficacy and reduced risk of undesirable side effects, as well as the expansion of cell therapies into cancer indications where there are no ideal Tumor-Associated Antigens. We are currently leveraging our NOT GATE gene circuit technology in our SENTI-202 and SENTI-401 CAR-NK programs in liquid and solid tumors. Furthermore, we believe the NOT GATE has the potential to significantly increase the applicability of CAR-NK cells against a wide range of liquid and solid tumors that currently do not have ideal Tumor-Associated Antigen targets and are thus currently unaddressed.
As shown in the figure below, we have engineered NK cells with a synthetic NOT GATE gene circuit, where an activating CAR, or aCAR, can drive the killing of cancer cells presenting an activating, Tumor-Associated Antigen, shown in green, while an inhibitory CAR, or iCAR, can suppress cytotoxicity against normal healthy cells that express both the activating Tumor-Associated Antigen and a Protective Antigen, shown in purple.
Future Applications and Alternate Gene Circuits
We believe the potentially enhanced precision enabled by our NOT GATE gene circuit technology may improve the therapeutic window, and thus the potential efficacy and safety, of our product candidates against the cancer types targeted by our pipeline. Furthermore, the NOT GATE has the potential to significantly increase the applicability of CAR-NK cells against a wide range of liquid and solid tumors that currently do not have ideal Tumor-Associated Antigen targets and are thus currently unaddressed.
 OR GATE
Background: The Need for Targeting Multiple Antigens
Many cancers are heterogeneous, making it difficult to treat them by only targeting a single antigen. For example, the development of targeted acute myeloid leukemia, or AML treatments is difficult due to more than 200 types of chromosome translocations and mutations having been identified in patients. Thus, therapies targeting a single AML-associated antigen are often insufficient to kill all of the tumor subsets, including both AML leukemic stem cells, or LSCs, and blasts. Consequently, most AML patients treated with these therapies die from disease relapse and progression due to incomplete therapeutic activity. Additionally, due to the highly mutagenic nature of cancer cells, targeting single antigens allows for cancers to more easily escape or acquire resistance to treatment. For 
example, while recent triumphs of CD19-directed autologous CAR-T therapies have brought renewed hope to patients with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies, up to 50% of patients with pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, suffer disease relapse within twelve months after treatment. Many of those patients who relapse toward the latter end of the twelve-month period have cancers that have been associated with loss of the CD19 epitope.
These clinical observations demonstrate the potential benefit of developing therapeutics that are capable of simultaneously targeting multiple Tumor-Associated Antigens across heterogeneous cancers using OR GATE gene circuit technology.
Our Logic Gating Solution: OR GATE
Our OR GATE gene circuits are designed to simultaneously target multiple Tumor-Associated Antigens. We are currently leveraging our OR GATE gene circuit technology in our SENTI-202 CAR-NK program for liquid tumors.
 Regulator Dial
Our Regulator Dial gene circuits are designed to enable the precise tuning of therapeutic activity from a cell or gene therapy product. For example, this can be implemented by regulating therapeutic payload expression in response to varying concentrations of FDA-approved drugs. Regulator Dials are designed to enable the exogenous regulation of next-generation cell and gene therapies in vivo even after they have been delivered. We have generated numerous Regulator Dial gene circuits that have the potential to be controlled by a variety of FDA-approved small molecule oral drugs, and that are designed to implement various control behaviors, such as ON switches, OFF switches and rheostats.
Background: The Need for Dynamic Regulation
Existing cell and gene therapies cannot be regulated once they are delivered into the patient. This lack of in vivo control makes it difficult to control dosing within the ideal therapeutic window. This problem makes it challenging to expand cell and gene therapies to many disease indications and to engineer these products to have increased potency and safety. As a result, gene therapies have focused on indications where constitutive expression is acceptable, rather than diseases where expression of the therapeutic payload must be regulated within a specific range or be toggled on and off over a period of time. As another example, CAR-T cell therapies for oncology have exhibited clinical toxicity due to lack of control post-infusion.
The efficacy of adoptive cell therapies in solid tumors is hampered by the poor persistence and dysfunction of these cell therapies in the immunosuppressive TME. Inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, have been shown in preclinical studies to enhance CAR-mediated effector functions and stimulate the innate immune response to further support tumor killing. However, clinical trials involving systemic use of IL-12 have demonstrated severe unexpected toxicity, limiting its clinical application. Overexpressing IL-12 from adoptive T cell therapies using a poorly regulated promoter has also resulted in significant clinical toxicities. Beyond toxicity issues, persistent stimulation by inflammatory cytokines has been associated with cell exhaustion and may limit anti-tumor activity. Thus, we believe a mechanism to dynamically regulate cytokine production by armored CAR-immune cells could enable enhanced anti-tumor activity without triggering unacceptable levels of toxicity in patients.
Our Gene Circuit Solution: Regulator Dial
One example of our Regulator Dial gene circuit technology is a system designed to regulate gene expression through FDA-approved orally dosed nonstructural protein 3, or NS3, inhibitors. This type of Regulator Dial consists of a synthetic drug-regulated transcription factor and a synthetic promoter responsive to this regulated transcription factor. In the absence of the drug, the transcription factor is inactive, and no therapeutic protein is produced from the engineered cells. In the presence of the drug, the small molecule triggers expression of the therapeutic protein in a 
dose-dependent manner through which the Regulator Dial “computes” the level of induction based on the concentration of the drug. 
We have also examined the potential of our Regulator Dial gene circuits in vivo. Immune-deficient NSG mice received NK cells engineered with our Regulator Dial gene circuit, followed by dosing of the small molecule that controls release of IL-12. We measured circulating levels of IL-12 and found a correlation between increasing levels in response to the small molecule which could be elicited with repeat dosing. This data demonstrates the potential that crIL-12 expression from engineered NK cells can be regulated in a repeated ON/OFF/ON fashion through the GRZ small molecule.
 Smart Sensor
A Smart Sensor is a gene circuit, or combination of gene circuits, designed to precisely detect cell type or disease environments, and thus distinguish between the “disease state” and “healthy state.” For example, Smart Sensors can be engineered to detect whether certain conditions, or disease biomarkers, are present before responding with a specific therapeutic response. Conventional medicines are generally unable to dynamically change their behavior in response to cell or disease specific conditions.
Diseases change over time and location in the body. Existing therapies are often unable to dynamically change their behavior in response to disease conditions or concentrate their activity only to specific places. Smart Sensors can be designed to sense diverse biomarkers that are specific to disease or cell states, including cell-surface antigens, soluble disease markers, metabolites, transcription factors, microRNAs and others. For example, we have created artificial receptors that are displayed on the surface of engineered cells and activate gene expression within these cells when they encounter specific cytokines or small molecule chemicals. We have also designed gene regulatory elements such as promoters and RNA elements that respond to specific intracellular signals, such as transcription factors and microRNAs.
Background: The Need for Novel Sensors in Smart Medicine
Cell and gene therapies have long held out the promise of curing a myriad of diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders. These therapies are generally comprised of three components: (i) the vector, which is used to deliver the transgene into cells; (ii) the promoter, which is a regulatory DNA sequence that drives expression of the transgene; and (iii) a transgene, which is the therapeutic payload.
While early successes in the field have led to recently approved gene therapies, it remains challenging to precisely target gene expression only in diseased cells. This is a significant limitation because many genetic disorders require controlled or targeted activity in certain cell types in order to correct diseases while preventing undesirable side effects. Similarly, in cancer gene therapy, it is important to achieve selective killing in cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. Engineering viral vectors that are biased toward specific cell types is limited by the availability of a unique feature on the outside of the target cell that a viral vector can harness.
Additionally, many of the promoters used in current gene therapies are not disease, cell or tissue specific and thus lack the ability to dynamically regulate therapeutic protein production in response to the disease state or location.
Our Smart Sensors Solution: Cell Type or Cell State Specific Conditional Synthetic Promoters
Our solution to address these limitations is to construct Smart Sensors that are selectively activated by cell type or cell state. For example, these Smart Sensors are synthetic promoters that sense internal control mechanisms that cells already possess, such as transcription factors. Transcription factors modulate regulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence of promoters to direct gene transcription to occur in a specific cell type, or even a specific cell state.
Selected Smart Sensor Proof-of-Concept Data
Candidate sequences were chosen via bioinformatics analyses based on differentially active/expressed genomic sequences. We performed multiple rounds of functional screenings to build synthetic promoters with high and specific activity in the target cell line chosen. As shown below, we started with clonal screening of native promoters and enhancers (lower left of the graph). Based on the data from the first round, the sequences with the highest activity were chosen, and ablation studies were performed (middle portion of the graph). Finally, the most significant DNA fragments were grouped and matched in various combinations (with additional sequences derived from high throughput screening), to build synthetic promoters with the highest and most specific activity (upper right of the graph).
We Believe Our Gene Circuits May Have Broad Applicability in Multiple Treatment Modalities and Disease Areas
We believe that our gene circuit platform may have broad applicability across treatment modalities and disease areas.
Treatment Modalities: Our gene circuit biological “software” can be used to program numerous cell and gene therapy products, or “hardware.” Specifically, these modalities include NK cells, T cells, TILs, stem cells including HSCs, in vivo gene therapy and mRNA. We have conducted research in multiple cell types and vector types, and the initial focus of our internal pipeline is implementing gene circuits within off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells.
Disease Areas: Our gene circuits can be customized to address many aspects of disease biology. We have demonstrated and published on applications of gene circuits across many different in vivo disease models. Thus, we believe that our gene circuit platform technologies can be used against a broad range of diseases that span therapeutic areas such as oncology, immunology, genetic diseases, neurology, cardiology, metabolic diseases, ophthalmology and regenerative medicine.
The following figure presents our perspective on how our gene circuit technologies can be utilized across modalities and corresponding therapeutic areas:
Our Pipeline
We are advancing a broad pipeline of gene circuit-enabled product candidates focused on three distinct categories: (i) our internal pipeline consisting of off-the-shelf CAR-NK cell therapy programs for oncology indications, (ii) our partnered programs related to gene therapies for tissue-directed targets (Spark Therapeutics, Inc.) and (iii) our partnered programs related to cell therapies for regenerative medicines (BlueRock Therapeutics, Inc.). Our most advanced programs are from our internal pipeline of off-the-shelf CAR-NK programs under which we are pursuing the discovery and development of product candidates designed to improve the therapeutic outcome in certain oncology indications as outlined below:
Our CAR-NK Cell Source
Our preferred cell source for our off-the-shelf CAR-NK cell pipeline is peripheral blood NK cells because it allows us to immediately leverage an established supply chain, a mature GMP process, and extensive clinical experience to develop our next generation CAR-NK cell therapies as illustrated below.
We have chosen to engineer NK cells with our gene circuits based on our belief that NK cells confer the following advantages in relation to other potential immune cell types in oncology:
•Innate Killing: NK cells naturally carry multiple activating and inhibitory receptors that enable them to innately kill tumor cells while sparing healthy tissues. Furthermore, NK cells have been engineered with CARs to enhance their targeted killing activity. We leverage these features to create Logic Gated CAR-NKs, such as OR GATE CAR-NKs that enhance the killing of heterogeneous tumors and NOT GATE CAR-NKs that spare healthy cells from undesired toxicity and thereby potentially improve on- target, on-tumor killing.
•Immune Activation: NK cells have been shown to support robust activation of anti-tumor immune pathways through pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion. We leverage this feature with our Multi-Arming gene circuits to further improve their ability to trigger endogenous, complementary anti-tumor activity by engaging the rest of the tumor immunity cycle.
•Validated Clinical Activity and Tolerability: Approximately 70 global peripheral blood derived off-the-shelf, as in healthy donor-derived, unengineered CAR-NK cells have been shown in the clinical setting to have the potential to promote anti-tumor activity along with relatively low risks of graft versus host disease, or GvHD, severe cytokine release syndrome, or CRS, and neurotoxicity.
•Off-the-Shelf Manufacturing for Broad Patient Access: We have established proprietary protocols to derive NK cells from healthy donors, manufacture them at scale with a projected low cost, and cryopreserve them with high retained viability post-thaw. As a result, we believe that CAR-NK cells have the potential to be broadly accessible to patients as they may be delivered rapidly to patients in an off-the-shelf manner and in an outpatient setting.
SENTI-202 for the Potential Treatment of Hematologic Malignancies including Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Overview
We are developing our SENTI-202 product candidate as a Logic Gated (OR + NOT) off-the-shelf CAR-NK cell therapy designed to target and eliminate cancer cells while sparing the healthy bone marrow. We are engineering SENTI-202 to express a bivalent CAR as an OR GATE directed against the Tumor-Associated Antigens, FLT3 and/or CD33, where one or both are expressed in 95% of AML patients. FLT3 is highly expressed on LSCs, while CD33 is highly expressed on AML blasts. AML is a heterogeneous disease composed of both AML LSCs and blasts. Thus, we believe that targeting FLT3 OR CD33 will enhance the overall killing activity against diseased cells in AML. However, FLT3 is also expressed on HSCs in the bone marrow. In order to spare FLT3-expressing healthy HSCs, 
we have further engineered SENTI-202 with a NOT GATE gene circuit consisting of an iCAR targeted against EMCN. EMCN is a Protective Antigen with high expression on HSCs and no or low expression on AML LSCs and blasts identified using our robust paired tumor-healthy target identification paradigm as outlined in the Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen Paired Discovery Platform section. We believe this NOT GATE gene circuit could allow SENTI-202 to eliminate LSCs that cause relapse while preserving the patient’s healthy HSCs. Further, SENTI-202 is engineered to express our proprietary crIL-15 to simultaneously stimulate surrounding immune cells and promote NK cell expansion, persistence and tumor killing. This proprietary product profile has the potential to drive towards deeper and longer remissions for AML by enabling killing of diverse AML cells while sparing HSCs that regenerate the blood and the immune systems.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia: an Unmet Medical Need
Almost 10% of new cancer cases in the United States each year are hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. AML is a type of acute leukemia characterized by an accumulation of malignant immature white blood cells. It is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults, constituting 80% to 85% of cases, and is the second most common—as well as the deadliest—in children. Due to the absence of highly efficacious therapies, AML has poor prognosis with a low five-year survival rate at just 30.5%.
Patients with CD33 and/or FLT3 expressing malignancies, which includes myeloid malignancies such as AML, have a grim prognosis and a high unmet need. At diagnosis, the 5-year survival for patients with AML is 30.5% in the US (SEER 2022). As noted, AML is typically a disease of the elderly with a median age of diagnosis being approximately 65 years. The treatment at diagnosis for the majority of patients who cannot tolerate the toxicities of intensive chemotherapy, ie, older, unfit patients, includes either hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara C, also known as cytarabine), as monotherapy or in combination with venetoclax, or best supportive care (NCCN AML 2022). In younger, fitter patients, the goal of treatment is to induce a complete remission (CR) with intensive chemotherapy and consolidate with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Treatment is combined with the respective targeted agents in patients who have CD33‑positive disease or a FLT3‑mutated disease (Mylotarg USPI; Rydapt USPI; Xospata USPI). Other therapies for AML include targeted 
agents for the minority of patients with either isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-1 or-2 mutated disease (Tibsovo USPI; Idhifa 2017). Despite these therapies being recently approved for patients with AML, the prognosis continues to be poor with the majority of patients refractory to or relapsing from front-line therapy and a median overall survival (OS) of 5 months at relapse (Brandwein 2020).
Development of targeted AML treatments is difficult due to the fact that the disease is highly heterogeneous, with more than 200 types of chromosome translocations and mutations having been identified in AML patients. Therapies targeting a single Tumor-Associated Antigen are therefore often insufficient to kill all of the cancer cell subsets in AML, leading to eventual disease relapse. To drive patients into deeper remissions and prevent relapses, therapies designed to target multiple AML antigens are needed. Additionally, recent studies suggest relapse is associated with the less targeted AML subpopulation of LSCs. Thus, the development of therapies targeting AML LSCs is sorely needed, but this has been challenging because LSC targets are often expressed on healthy cells, such as HSCs, leading to on-target, off-tumor treatment-induced toxicities.
CAR Cell Therapy for AML
The therapeutic administration of CAR cell therapies has considerably advanced the treatment of certain cancers, such as B-cell malignancies. However, the successes of CAR cell therapies have not yet translated to successful treatment of AML, in part due to the absence of AML-specific target antigens. Due to their nonrestrictive expression, most AML antigens are also expressed on healthy HSCs or myeloid cells. Thus, on-target, off-tumor killing effects of the therapy may lead to the ablation of hematopoietic stem, progenitor or myeloid cells. This off-tumor killing of HSCs leads to serious clinical sequelae including sepsis and febrile neutropenia contributing to morbidity and mortality. Thus, the identification of antigens that enable more robust targeting of AML cells, including LSCs, along with new strategies to reduce off-target killing of HSCs, are critically needed to realize the promise of CAR cell therapies for AML treatment. These described challenges also extend to other potential AML therapeutic modalities, such as antibodies and bispecific T cell engagers.
SENTI-202 Approach to AML
Our SENTI-202 off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells are engineered with gene circuits that are designed to enable identification of cancerous versus healthy cells using NOT GATE + OR GATE logic decisions, and potentially improved persistence and more durable antitumor functions. SENTI-202 combines two different Logic Gates, and crIL-15 expression, as follows:
1.An iCAR NOT GATE gene circuit to prevent CAR-mediated killing of cells expressing either FLT3 or CD33 and a Protective Antigen, EMCN. The EMCN iCAR is intended to suppress CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity against healthy HSCs, reducing the risk of potential life-threatening bone marrow toxicity and potentially increasing the therapeutic window and on-target, on-tumor activity.
2.An aCAR OR GATE gene circuit to activate CAR-mediated killing of AML cells expressing either or both of the Tumor-Associated Antigens FLT3 and CD33, thus increasing the targeting of both AML LSCs and blasts.
3.A crIL-15 gene circuit to simultaneously stimulate surrounding immune cells and promote NK cell expansion, persistence and tumor killing.
The following figure illustrates the design of SENTI-202 Logic Gating gene circuits to kill AML LSCs and blasts, while sparing healthy HSCs via (FLT3 OR CD33) NOT EMCN logic. Based on the medical community’s substantial clinical experience from autologous and allogeneic-bone marrow transplantations. 
Using our proprietary Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen Paired Discovery Platform, we identified FLT3 and CD33 as desirable TAAs for an OR GATE gene circuit to have the potential for comprehensive CAR-mediated killing of AML, including AML LSCs and blasts. As well as the corresponding PA, EMCN, for application in AML.
SENTI-202 Preclinical Data
As shown below, in comparison to unengineered NK cells, SENTI-202 CAR-NK cells exhibited increased and more consistent cell killing across a variety of primary patient AML or MDS blasts, or AML leukemia stem cells in vitro.
Similarly, in a luciferase tagged MV4-11 AML xenogenic tumor model in immunocompromised mice, we observed decreased bioluminescence indicating decrease in AML tumor burden, and increased survival when the mice were treated with a single dose of SENTI-202 compared to unengineered NK cells or vehicle control.
Using the same proprietary transcriptomics and proteomics-based bioinformatics methodology discussed earlier, we identified EMCN as a target antigen that is highly expressed on healthy HSCs but not on AML LSCs or blasts. This validates EMCN’s potential as a Protective Antigen to protect HSCs from potential on-target, off-tumor CAR-NK mediated toxicity. The rationale for utilizing EMCN as the Protective Antigen is further bolstered by a previous finding in the literature that identified EMCN as a marker of the key cell type for repopulating the blood and immune systems.
Upon selection of EMCN as our primary Protective Antigen target, we next incorporated binders for the FLT3 activating CAR (aCAR) and the EMCN Protective Antigen into our internal NOT GATE (iCAR) discovery and development platform in order to best identify the optimal iCAR architecture for the SENTI-202 program. Using different FLT3 NOT EMCN CAR-NK cells (primary NK cells engineered to co-express the same FLT3 aCAR with one of dozens of different proprietary EMCN iCARs), we performed an in vitro cytotoxicity protection assay screen using target cells that expressed only the FLT3 Tumor-Associated Antigen and not the EMCN PA or target cells that expressed both the FLT3 Tumor-Associated Antigen and the EMCN PA. This latter target cell population should be protected from aCAR-mediated killing if the particular iCAR is functional. Using this approach, we identified multiple functional EMCN iCAR architectures that enabled robust target cell killing in the absence of the PA (model cancer cells) and provided significant antigen-dependent target cell protection in the presence of the EMCN PA (model healthy cells).
AML cell line or healthy primary hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were co-cultured with either a CAR-NK cell that only expressed the activating CAR (i.e. CD33 and/or FLT3 CAR) or SENTI-202 (i.e., with the activating CAR and the EMCN-recognising inhibitory CAR). We saw identical killing activity of the leukemia cells with both CAR-NKs. We saw significant selective protection of healthy HSC when exposed to SENTI-202 demonstrating in vitro protection of healthy cells from our proprietary EMCN targeting NOT gate.
We observed greater than 90% protection of model “healthy” cells in vivo. We injected 1:1:1 ratio of effector cells with model leukemia cells that expressed CD33 and FLT3 target antigens, and model “healthy” cells that expressed CD33, FLT3 and the protective EMCN antigen. The three effector cells used in this experiment were either unengineered NK cells, CAR-NK cells with just the CD33 and/or FLT3 activating CAR, and SENTI-202. We observed that only in the SENTI-202 group, there was selective killing of the leukemia cells and sparing of the model “healthy” cells after greater than 3 weeks in vivo. In the other two groups, there was non-selective killing of both the leukemia and the “healthy” cells.
Development Plan and Key Next Steps for SENTI-202
We have demonstrated, in preclinical studies, the functionality of the full gene circuit components of SENTI-202, and we selected our lead development candidate in 2022. We plan to submit an IND application in the second half of 2023 to support the clinical evaluation of SENTI-202.
Our planned Phase 1 study aims to evaluate SENTI-202 in patients with R/R CD33 and /or FLT3 positive hematologic malignancies including AML. We plan to administer multiple doses of study drug following standard fludarabine/cyclophosphamide based lymphodepletion as “Cycles” of study treatment. At the end of a Cycle, we will evaluate both efficacy and safety. Patients may be eligible to receive additional such Cycles based on both tumor response and tolerability of treatment. The study will evaluate 2-3 dose levels of cells and evaluate efficacy and pharmacodynamic markers in addition to standard Phase 1 objectives of safety, pharmacokinetics and dose finding.
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Contract to Support Development of SENTI-202
In September 2021, we were awarded funding from the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health in the form of a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract to support further development of SENTI-202 for AML towards clinical development. The Direct to Phase II SBIR contract will provide us with approximately $1.99 million in federal funding for the SENTI-202 program over two years.
SENTI-401 for the Potential Treatment of CRC and Other Solid Tumors
Overview
Through our SENTI-401 program, we are pursuing the development of a Logic Gated off-the-shelf CAR-NK cell therapy product candidate designed to more precisely target and eliminate colorectal cancer, or CRC cells while sparing healthy cells elsewhere in the body. We are engineering NK cells to express a CAR directed against CEA, which is highly overexpressed in 85% to 90% of colorectal cancer samples but is also expressed in epithelial cells in healthy tissues. CEA is also expressed in other solid tumors, including lung, breast and gastric cancers. The expression profile of CEA in both tumor and healthy cells has resulted in on-target, off-tumor toxicities by other CEA-targeted therapies in clinical development, thus limiting their clinical success. To address this challenge, we are engineering NK cells with a NOT GATE implemented via an iCAR targeted against an epithelial cell Protective Antigen called VSIG2. Thus, the SENTI-401 program’s Logic Gating is intended to more effectively treat CRC patients by targeting a well-known Tumor-Associated Antigen, CEA, and widen the therapeutic window by preventing killing when CEA appears on healthy cells that also express the VSIG2 Protective Antigen. We are also engineering SENTI-401 to express a combination of potent immune effectors, including our proprietary crIL-15 protein to simultaneously stimulate surrounding immune cells and promote NK cell expansion, persistence and 
tumor killing, and an additional undisclosed potent immune effector to potentially enhance therapeutic function in solid tumors.
Colorectal Cancer: an Unmet Medical Need
CRC accounts for approximately 10% of all annually diagnosed cancers and cancer-related deaths worldwide and is the second and third most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and men, respectively. The incidence of CRC worldwide is predicted to increase to 2.5 million new cases in 2035. Of new colorectal cancer diagnoses, 20% of patients present with metastatic disease and another 25% who present with localized disease will later develop metastases. Among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, approximately 70% to 75% of patients survive after one year of their initial diagnosis; however, the five-year survival rate is less than 20% despite multiple lines of treatment, including combinations of chemotherapy and targeted therapies.
SENTI-401 Approach to CRC
CEA is a tumor-associated protein overexpressed in many epithelial cancers, most notably in colorectal cancer. However, it is also expressed in a variety of normal epithelial cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Bioinformatics analyses of RNA sequencing data collected from over 9,500 tumor and 8,500 healthy tissue samples showed that CEACAM5, one of the main isoforms of CEA, is overexpressed across many cancer types, especially colorectal cancer. CEACAM5 expression is also found in healthy organs, including tissues in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. Cancer immunotherapies using vaccines and antibodies targeting CEA are actively being investigated in the clinical setting. However, recent clinical studies have shown dose-limiting on-target, off-tumor toxicities in these healthy tissues that also express CEA.
We are pursuing the development of a potential SENTI-401 product candidate to overcome the challenges associated with targeting the CEA Tumor-Associated Antigen that is present on both tumor and healthy cells. To 
mitigate the potential risk of on-target, off-tumor toxicity, we are designing our SENTI-401 product candidate with a NOT GATE gene circuit to differentiate between cancerous and healthy cells. Specifically, SENTI-401 incorporates the following gene circuits:
1.An iCAR with a NOT GATE gene circuit that restricts CAR-mediated cell killing to CRC cells that express CEA but not healthy cells that express an epithelial cell Protective Antigen, VSIG2. This NOT GATE is designed to potentially reduce on-target, off-tumor toxicity, thus potentially enabling more effective treatment of CEA-expressing cancers.
2.An aCAR that targets CEA, a well-characterized antigen that is overexpressed in many cancers, including CRC.
3.A crIL-15 gene circuit to simultaneously stimulate surrounding immune cells and promote NK cell expansion, persistence and tumor killing.
4.An IL-21 potent immune effector to potentially enhance therapeutic function in solid tumors.
SENTI-401 Supporting Data
Our CEA aCAR-NK cells significantly reduced tumor burden in a luciferase tagged human CRC xenograft (LoVo) tumor model in vivo especially with the addition of both crIL-15 and IL21 as shown below in terms of both enhanced survival and decreased tumor burden (as shown by decreased bioluminescence in the mouse photographs). Hence, we have incorporated both cytokines into our planned SENTI-401 circuit.
Further, incorporation of IL21 along with crIL15 and the activating CAR resulted in enhanced serial killing with exposure to 3 rounds of tumor cells even in the presence of an inhibitory cytokine TGF-B. We believe this could potentially enhance the ability of SENTI-401 to be active in solid tumors by overcoming a relatively immuno-suppressive tumor milieu.
Utilization of the VISG2 protein as our NOT GATE gene circuit Protective Antigen
We have developed a robust Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen Paired Discovery Platform for the development of NOT GATE CAR-NK therapies. Using this approach, we have identified genes that are differentially expressed in healthy versus tumor tissues and selected antigen candidates based on-target expression in tissues, subcellular localization, antigen topology or presence of extracellular domains and antibody availability. To protect healthy epithelial cells that also express CEA, we identified VSIG2 as a Protective Antigen candidate. VSIG2 exhibits a favorable pattern of expression in the membrane of epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, which are CEA-positive tissues that are most at risk of on-target, off-tumor toxicity. We further validated the expression of VSIG2 using immunohistochemistry, or IHC, in healthy tissues and confirmed the lack of expression in primary CRC tumor tissue samples. Specifically, IHC analyses of colorectal tumor tissues and healthy colon epithelium demonstrated that CEA is expressed in both healthy samples, as shown in the upper left of the figure below, and tumor samples, as shown in the lower left of the figure below. In addition, the Protective Antigen VSIG2 
is only expressed in healthy colon epithelium, as shown in the upper right of the figure below, and not in tumor samples, as shown in the lower right of the figure below.
Leveraging these findings, we have constructed VSIG2 iCARs that showed selective NOT GATE functions in vitro. As shown in the figure below, we engineered NK cells to express both our CEA-aCAR and VSIG2-iCAR to evaluate the protective function of the VSIG2 iCAR. When model “healthy” cells, which were engineered to express VSIG2 in addition to CEA, were exposed to CAR-NK cells that had both the aCAR and the iCAR, nearly 100% protection was observed in vitro. Furthermore, killing of cancer cells that only expressed CEA+ was unimpaired in the presence of the iCAR.
Development Plan and Key Next Steps for SENTI-401
SENTI-401 is our first planned IND for solid tumors and in 2023, we plan to present preclinical data from our SENTI-401 program at key scientific conferences.
SENTI-301A for the Potential Treatment of HCC and Other Solid Tumors
Overview
Through our SENTI-301A program we have pursued the development of a Multi-Armed off-the-shelf CAR-NK cell therapy product candidate for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC. This program requires the engineering of NK cells to target GPC3, which is highly expressed in 70% to 90% of HCCs and has low or no expression on normal adult tissues. SENTI-301A is armed with our proprietary crIL-15 gene circuit, intended to simultaneously stimulate surrounding immune cells and promote NK cell expansion, persistence, and tumor killing.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma: an Unmet Medical Need
HCC accounts for approximately 90% of primary liver cancers and represents a large unmet medical need due to the lack of effective treatment options. Globally, it is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer, and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths. In the United States, the rate of death from liver cancer increased by 43% from 7.2 to 10.3 deaths per 100,000 people between 2000 and 2016. Frequently, HCC develops in patients with liver disease such as chronic hepatitis B or C virus, alcoholic liver disease or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
Available therapies are only modestly efficacious and the mortality rate in advanced HCC remains high despite recent improvements in treatment options. The most effective therapy currently available for advanced HCC is atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination therapy for first line treatment with a 28% objective response rate and a 7% complete response rate.
SENTI-301A Approach to Advanced HCC
SENTI-301A off-the-shelf NK cells are engineered to incorporate multiple anti-tumor activities to achieve a Multi-Armed attack on solid tumors.
Specifically, SENTI-301A includes:
1.An aCAR that targets GPC3, a highly expressed antigen in HCC and that has low or no expression on normal adult tissues.
2.crIL-15 to simultaneously stimulate surrounding immune cells and promote NK cell expansion, and persistence, and tumor killing.
GPC3 is a Tumor-Associated Antigen expressed in approximately 70% to 90% of human HCCs and in 29-54% of other solid tumors, but not expressed in healthy liver tissue or other human organs after birth. GPC3 has previously been clinically evaluated as a therapeutic target for immunotherapy in HCC. GPC3 is also a histologic and serum clinical marker for HCC and its expression has been associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, GPC3 is associated with the control of cell division and growth regulation. We built GPC3 CAR constructs to redirect NK-mediated cytotoxicity against advanced HCC using a GPC3 binder that associates to the membrane proximal region of the GPC3 protein.
IL-15 has been shown to improve NK cell persistence in vivo and maintain cytotoxicity. Our proprietary crIL-15 gene circuit is designed to promote NK cell expansion, persistence, and tumor killing. We believe that the ability of crIL-15 to secrete active IL-15 into the TME in a calibrated fashion should also enable stimulation of endogenous immune cells within the tumor microenvironment in solid tumor settings.
Development Plan and Key Next Steps for SENTI-301A
We have demonstrated in preclinical studies the full gene circuit components of SENTI-301A In January 2023, we paused development of SENTI-301A for financial, not scientific considerations, and we are planning to pursue potential partnering opportunities or future clinical development, especially in territories within Asia where HCC is more prevalent than in the United States. Accordingly, we are actively pursuing strategic geographic partnerships for the clinical development of SENTI-301A.
Our Gene Circuit Application Outside of Oncology
In addition to our off-the-shelf CAR-NK programs, we have discovery stage programs focused on gene therapies for tissue-directed targets and cell therapies for regenerative medicines. In particular, we have entered into collaborations with Spark Therapeutics, Inc (subsidiary of Roche Holding AG) for the design of Smart Sensors for disease- and tissue-specific gene therapy, and with Bluerock Therapeutics LP (subsidiary of Bayer AG) for the use of Smart Sensors and Regulator Dials for regenerative medicines. The following pipeline chart depicts our discovery stage programs under the two collaborations.
Portfolio Expansion Opportunities
Our Discovery Stage Programs
We believe our gene circuits can be readily adapted to new disease contexts to enable a variety of additional CAR-NK product candidates that address important cancers. For example, there are additional opportunities for the application of the NOT GATE gene circuit toward other solid and/or liquid tumor indications beyond SENTI-401. Toward that end, we have developed a Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen Paired Discovery Platform to identify future opportunities.
Our platform has the potential to enable the development of multiple product candidates that harness the full breadth of our gene circuit platform beyond Logic Gating and Multi-Arming of off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells within oncology. Our additional discovery efforts are focused on a diverse set of cell and gene therapy applications outside of oncology. In particular, we have entered into collaborations with Spark Therapeutics, Inc. (subsidiary of Roche Holding AG) for the design of Smart Sensors for disease- and tissue-specific gene therapy, and with Bluerock Therapeutics, Inc. (subsidiary of Bayer AG) for the use of Smart Sensors and Regulator Dials for regenerative medicines.
Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen Paired Discovery Platform
We have developed a proprietary Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen Paired Discovery Platform to select and validate NOT GATE antigen candidates, as shown in the figure below. We have built a generalizable bioinformatics pipeline that uses RNA transcriptomics data to discover and prioritize tumor and healthy tissue Protective Antigens. We identify Tumor-Associated Antigens that are highly expressed in cancer cells with as little healthy tissue expression as possible, for example Tumor-Associated Antigen A in the figure below. We then identify healthy tissue selective Protective Antigens, for example Protective Antigen E in the figure below, that can protect those healthy tissues that express the Tumor-Associated Antigens, for example Tissues 2 and 5 in the figure below. This process looks at differences in Protective Antigen gene expression in healthy versus tumor tissue. Leads are selected based on the co-expression of Tumor-Associated Antigens and Protective Antigens in healthy tissues, the localization of the Protective Antigens to the cell surface, Protective Antigen topology (presence of extracellular domain) and Protective Antigen-specific antibody availability. Prioritized Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen pairs are further validated in primary cancer and primary healthy tissue samples. We leveraged this platform to identify the Protective Antigen targets for the SENTI-202 and SENTI-401 programs, thus demonstrating our ability to target both liquid and solid tumors. This approach allows us to potentially expand our NOT GATE approach to additional cancer indications in which existing single-target approaches, such as monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates and single-target CAR cells, are inadequate due to a lack of specificity for cancer cells.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing capabilities are central to our business strategy, because they can enable us to control the quality and supply of our off-the-shelf CAR-NK cell therapies for clinical studies and ultimately commercialization. A key advantage of off-the-shelf cell therapies, versus autologous products that use each patient’s own cells, is the ability to manufacture large batches of drug product from healthy donor cells that can be produced in advance of clinical use, and then stored in frozen vials. Upon commercialization, we expect to be able to make our cell therapies, if approved, broadly accessible in an off-the-shelf manner to cancer patients.
Critical aspects of the cell manufacturing process include the ability to perform four key steps in the CAR-NK cell manufacturing process:
Step 1: Source, Isolate and Bank Purified NK Cells as Starting Cells.
Starting Cells are obtained from enriching and isolating NK cells from qualified healthy donors. Purified NK cells are subsequently cryopreserved and characterized for consistent performance, including assays for cell phenotype, transduction efficiency, cell expansion capability and anti-tumor cytotoxicity. For our initial SENTI-202, SENTI-401, and SENTI-301A product candidates, we plan to derive Starting Cells from leukapheresis products collected from qualified healthy donors. From each leukapheresis collection, we intend to isolate and cryopreserve hundreds of millions of Starting Cells to support multiple product production batches. We believe that peripheral blood derived leukapheresis products are an attractive starting material source due to (i) a mature and validated commercial supply chain, (ii) the large number of purified NK cells per collection and (iii) our ability to characterize the NK cells prior to initiation of manufacturing. An analysis of over a dozen recent isolations performed from different healthy donors demonstrated that our process achieved greater than 95% NK cell purity, greater than 90% viability and up to 500 million NK cells per collection. We select for preferred donors with high expansion potential in our CAR-NK process, which allows us to generate ~70 trillion NK cells from a single donor collection, as shown in the figures below.
Step 2: Genetically Engineer Starting Cells with Gene Circuits.
We genetically modify our NK cells through a viral vector transduction process focused on enhancing gene circuit expression while minimizing impacts on compromising cell viability or cell expansion. To generate
our CAR-NK products, the Starting Cells are first thawed and activated. On a specific day post activation, the activated cells undergo our vector transduction process to genetically incorporate our gene circuits. The figures below show that transduction of our activated Starting Cells did not reduce cell expansion rate and provided superior cancer cell killing compared to unengineered cells.
Step 3: Expand and Scale CAR-NK Cells.
Our expansion process is designed to generate large numbers of final product doses per manufacturing batch. As shown in the figures below, our current process has consistently produced greater than 6,000-fold expansion of CAR-NK cells in a 21 day process with high harvest recovery and viability, achieving a planned clinical manufacturing scale of hundreds of patient doses per a single manufacturing batch. We are developing additional 
technologies and processes to further enhance NK cell expansion for commercial manufacturing, including alternative methods for cell activation and expansion using perfusion bioreactors.
Step 4: Formulate and Cryopreserve CAR-NK Cells.
For freezing and distribution, we intend to formulate and cryopreserve our final product to retain viability, persistence and cytotoxic function post-thaw for off-the-shelf use. Each batch of CAR-NK cells will be filled into vials and cryopreserved for long term storage. The CAR-NK cell product candidates will be shipped in vials to clinical sites, where they will be thawed and infused on demand. We have demonstrated that cryopreserved CAR-NK cells can retain key functional properties required for cancer treatment, including stable transgene expression for over one month. As shown below, our cryopreserved CAR-NK cells retained viability and anti-tumor functions in both in vitro and in vivo models of AML:
Technical Expertise and Facilities for Clinical and Commercial Manufacturing
Our corporate headquarters is located in South San Francisco, CA, where we lease approximately 40,000 square feet of research and development and corporate office space. In this location, we have approximately 10,000 square feet dedicated to manufacturing development labs. We have established research and development teams with extensive experience in cell and gene therapy manufacturing operations, including vector process development, cell process development, analytical development, quality control and quality assurance. In June 2021, we signed a lease agreement for a property in Alameda, California with approximately 92,000 square feet for development as a state-of-the-art Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, facility to support clinical and commercial-scale manufacturing of multiple off-the-shelf CAR-NK cell product candidates. This manufacturing facility is designed as a customized end-to-end manufacturing solution to give us the ability to isolate NK cells, engineer these cells with proprietary gene circuits, perform cell culture expansion in large batches, and cryopreserve and store the final cGMP products. In January 2023, we initiated the technology transfer of SENTI-202 to our cGMP manufacturing facility as part of our goal to provide clinical-scale manufacturing for off-the-shelf CAR-NK cell product candidates. We anticipate that this facility will be suitable to support initial clinical trials for our lead product candidates. We plan to leverage the latest cell therapy manufacturing technologies as we strive to optimize quality, maximize scalability and minimize cost.
Our off-the-shelf production process and proprietary manufacturing capabilities are central to our business strategy of maintaining control over the quality and supply of our present and future product candidates for off-the-shelf CAR-NK cell therapies. In addition, we believe that our proprietary manufacturing process enables an anticipated cost in line with competitive off-the-shelf production process estimates. Continued advancements in cell culture scale and process efficiencies may further reduce this cost over time.
In addition, we may also leverage our manufacturing facility to expand the application of our gene circuit technology to biomanufacturing in partnership with one or more third parties. See the section titled “Potential Collaboration Related to Gene Circuits and GMP Manufacturing.”

After exercise of an option, Spark will be responsible for all development, manufacture, commercialization and exploitation in the licensed field, at its own cost and expense, of all in vivo gene therapy products containing an applicable licensed promoter, and we will retain the right to develop, manufacture, commercialize and exploit other products that incorporate the licensed promoters as well as in vivo gene therapy products that incorporate the licensed promoters for uses outside the licensed field. If Spark does not exercise an option for a particular promoter profile prior to the expiration of the evaluation period for such promoter profile, we will retain all rights to the synthetic promoters developed under the Spark Agreement without any further obligations to Spark for such promoter profile.
Pursuant to the Spark Agreement, we received an upfront payment from Spark of $3 million. If Spark exercises an option for a particular promoter profile, it will be required to pay us an option exercise fee in the low to mid-single digit millions. For each licensed promoter-containing in vivo gene therapy product, or licensed product, developed and commercialized by Spark or its affiliates or sublicensees, we are eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments from Spark up to an aggregate dollar amount in the mid teens millions, and sales milestone payments from Spark up to an aggregate dollar amount in the low hundred millions. In total, we are potentially eligible to receive upfront, opt-in and milestone payments exceeding $645 million if Spark exercises its options for all five promoter profiles and Spark, its affiliates and its sublicensees successfully develop and commercialize five licensed products; we will be eligible to receive additional milestone payments if additional licensed products are developed and commercialized by Spark, its affiliates and its sublicensees. Further, Spark will be obligated to pay us royalties in the low-single digits percentage on net sales of each licensed product sold by Spark, its affiliates and its sublicensees, subject to specified reductions and offsets. Spark’s obligation to pay royalties to us will expire for each licensed product when certain licensed patents and regulatory exclusivities have expired in the country of sale and a minimum number of years has elapsed since the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. The Spark Agreement will expire at the end of the last evaluation period if Spark does not exercise any of its options. If Spark exercises at least one option, then the Spark Agreement will expire, on a licensed product-by- licensed product and country-by-country basis, upon the expiration of Spark’s royalty obligation for such licensed product in such country. Spark may terminate the Spark Agreement in its entirety, or on a promoter profile-by-promoter profile or licensed promoter-by-licensed promoter basis, following a specified notice period. Either party may terminate the Spark Agreement in its entirety or in part if the other party fails to cure its material breach of the Spark Agreement within a specified cure period, or immediately if the other party becomes bankrupt or insolvent. We may terminate the Spark Agreement if Spark or any of its affiliates commences any action challenging the validity or enforceability of the licensed patents, other than in certain specified circumstances, or if Spark’s sublicensee challenges our licensed patents, under certain specified circumstances.
Collaboration and Option Agreement with BlueRock Therapeutics LP
In May 2021, we entered into a Collaboration and Option Agreement, or the BlueRock Agreement, with BlueRock Therapeutics LP, or BlueRock. BlueRock is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bayer Healthcare LLC. Bayer Healthcare LLC’s parent company is Bayer AG, which served as the lead investor in our Series B financing through its Leaps by Bayer unit. Under the BlueRock Agreement, we have engaged in three collaboration programs with BlueRock to research and develop gene circuits that have specified functions. We are responsible for up to $10 million in costs and expenses incurred in connection with our conduct of research activities under an agreed-upon research plan. If the parties mutually agree to add new research activities to the research plan, then BlueRock will be obligated to reimburse us for the costs and expenses that we incur in connection with the agreed-upon additional research activities that, together with costs and expenses incurred under the initial research plan, exceed $10 million. We have not yet received any payment from BlueRock under the BlueRock Agreement and we do not have any obligations to make any payments to BlueRock under the BlueRock Agreement. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the research activities assigned to us under the research plan. If we materially breach that obligation and do not cure it within a specified period, BlueRock will have the right to receive a transfer of technology and perform the remainder of the research plan at its own expense.
Upon completion of work under a research plan for a collaboration program, the joint steering committee established by the parties will identify, subject to a specified maximum, a number of gene circuits per collaboration program, or option gene circuits, that have been successfully developed under such collaboration program. We have granted to BlueRock an option, on a collaboration program-by-collaboration program basis, to obtain an exclusive or non-exclusive license under our intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize, for the prevention, treatment or palliation of specified indications, or a licensed field, cell therapy products that contain cells of specified types that incorporate an option gene circuit from such collaboration program or a closely related derivative gene circuit. For each collaboration program, BlueRock may conduct evaluation activities on the option gene circuits from such collaboration program to determine whether to exercise its option, and BlueRock may exercise its option to such option gene circuits together with certain closely related derivative gene circuits, or licensed gene circuits, prior to the expiration of a certain time period, or the option exercise period, which includes a minimum amount of time after the expiration of the three-year research term, delivery of a data package to 
BlueRock, and completion of a transfer of technology to enable BlueRock’s evaluation activities, whichever happens last. If BlueRock exercises its option for a collaboration program, the parties shall negotiate the financial terms, which will be within certain pre-agreed parameters and may be determined by baseball arbitration if the parties do not reach agreement within the specified negotiation period, and enter into an otherwise agreed-upon written license agreement, or a commercial license. If the parties enter into a commercial license, BlueRock will be responsible, at its sole expense, for the development, manufacture and commercialization, in the applicable licensed field, of cell therapy products containing cells of an applicable type that incorporate an applicable licensed gene circuit, and we will be eligible to receive from BlueRock development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments, in amounts to be agreed-upon before entry into the commercial license, and royalties, subject to negotiation, equal to low single digit percentages of net sales of applicable cell therapy products sold by BlueRock, its affiliates and its sublicensees, subject to specified reductions and offsets. If BlueRock does not exercise its option for a collaboration program prior to the expiration of the applicable option exercise period, then we will retain all rights to the gene circuits developed under such collaboration program without any further obligations to BlueRock.
For each collaboration program, we are obligated to work exclusively with BlueRock on the development, manufacture and commercialization, in the applicable licensed field, of cell therapy products that contain cells of specified types that incorporate the specific type of gene circuit for such collaboration programs. The end date for this exclusivity obligation for each collaboration program will depend upon whether BlueRock exercises its option for such collaboration program and, if it does, whether the parties enter into a commercial license for such collaboration program. If BlueRock does not exercise its option, then it will end on the expiration of the applicable option exercise period. If BlueRock exercises its option but the parties do not enter into a commercial license, then it will end after a specified time following expiration of the applicable negotiation or baseball arbitration period for the commercial license. If BlueRock exercises its option and the parties enter into a commercial license, then it will end a certain amount of time after the later of completion of research activities or execution of the commercial license.
In addition to the option described above, we granted a right of first negotiation to BlueRock, on a collaboration program-by-collaboration program basis, to obtain a license under our intellectual property rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, for the prevention, treatment or palliation of a specified disease area, or the negotiation field, cell therapy products containing cells of a specified type, or the negotiation cells, that incorporate an applicable efficacy gene circuit developed under such collaboration program. This right of first negotiation does not overlap with the option described above because it pertains to different combinations of fields, cell types and gene circuits. Starting from the effective date of the BlueRock Agreement and, on a collaboration program-by-collaboration program basis, continuing for twelve months or, if later, until the completion of a certain portion of the research plan for such collaboration program, we are obligated to work exclusively with BlueRock on the development, manufacture and commercialization, in the negotiation field, of cell therapy products containing negotiation cells that incorporate the specific type of gene circuit for such collaboration program.
The BlueRock Agreement will expire, on a collaboration program-by-collaboration program basis, upon the earliest of the expiration of the option exercise period for such collaboration program, the effective date of the commercial license, the expiration of the applicable negotiation or baseball arbitration period for the commercial license, or the date the parties mutually agree to cease negotiations for the commercial license. Such expiration shall occur no later than January 2026 unless the parties mutually agree to extend the research term. BlueRock may terminate the BlueRock Agreement in its entirety, or on a collaboration program-by-collaboration program basis, following a specified notice period. Either party may terminate the BlueRock Agreement if the other party fails to cure its material breach of the BlueRock Agreement within a specified cure period, or immediately if the other party becomes bankrupt or insolvent. We may terminate the BlueRock Agreement if BlueRock or any of its affiliates commences any action challenging the validity or enforceability of our patents, other than in certain specified circumstances, or if BlueRock’s sublicensee challenges our patents under certain specified circumstances.
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Contract to Support Development of SENTI-202 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
In September 2021, we were awarded funding from the National Cancer Institute in the form of a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract to support further development of SENTI-202 for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) towards clinical development. The Direct to Phase II SBIR contract will provide funding over two 
years from the NCI of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is titled: “Logic-Gated Chimeric Antigen Receptor- Natural Killer Cell Therapy for Acute Myeloid Leukemia.” With the award of this contract, the SENTI-202 program will be funded in part with Federal funds from the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. 75N91021C00026.
Exclusive Patent License Agreement with the National Cancer Institute for GPC3 Technology
In February 2021, we entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement, or the NCI GPC3 Agreement, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by the NCI, under which the NCI granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license under the NCI’s patent rights related to glypican-3, or GPC3, targeting CAR technology to make and have made, use and have used, sell and have sold, offer to sell and import products covered by the licensed patent rights and to practice and have practiced processes covered by the licensed patent rights, for the development, production and commercialization of a monospecific CAR-based immunotherapy for the prophylaxis and treatment of GPC3 expressing human cancers using unmodified, off-the-shelf natural killer cells transduced with a viral vector that expresses a CAR, and a gene circuit regulating the expression of one or more armoring payloads, specifically excluding the use of autologous T cells or T cells that have been genetically modified to become off-the-shelf. The foregoing license is subject to (i) certain rights of the United States government, including an irrevocable, non-exclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the government to practice all licensed patent rights throughout the world and (ii) the NCI’s reserved rights to grant a non-exclusive license to practice the licensed patent rights for purposes of internal research (and not for purposes of commercial manufacture or distribution) at an academic or corporate facility.
The NCI GPC3 Agreement will expire, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, on the expiration of all licensed patent rights that claim the applicable licensed product in the applicable country. Licensed patent rights are currently expected to expire in 2033, absent any patent term extension or adjustment. We may terminate the NCI GPC3 Agreement in its entirety or with respect to a country for any reason by providing 60 days’ prior written notice to the NCI. The NCI may terminate the NCI GPC3 Agreement if (i) we breach any material obligations under the NCI GPC3 Agreement and fail to cure such breach within 90 days after receiving written notice thereof, or (ii) if the NCI reasonably determines that (a) we are not executing the commercial development plan, including the milestones specified therein, (b) we have willfully made a false statement or omitted a material fact in our license application or any report to the NCI, (c) we have committed a material breach of a covenant or agreement to the NCI, (d) we are not keeping the licensed products or licensed services reasonably available to the public after commercial use commences, (e) we cannot reasonably satisfy unmet health and safety needs, (f) we cannot reasonably justify a failure to comply with the domestic production requirement or (g) we have been found by a court to have violated antitrust laws in connection with our performance under the NCI GPC3 Agreement, in each case of (a) through (f), where we fail to alleviate the NCI’s concerns in 90 days. Additionally, the NCI reserves the right to terminate or modify the NCI GPC3 Agreement if the NCI determines that such action is necessary to meet the requirements for public use specified by federal regulations issued after the date of the license and these requirements are not reasonably satisfied by us.
Potential Collaboration Related to Gene Circuits and GMP Manufacturing
We may seek to leverage our manufacturing capabilities and cGMP facility to enable us to expand the application of our gene circuit technology through a partnership in the biomanufacturing space. While we intend to use our proprietary gene circuit technology and manufacturing facility primarily for therapeutic product development and commercialization, our technology and facility can also be applied to noncompetitive biomanufacturing applications, which we believe is an approach well-suited for partnering. A potential biomanufacturing partnership could involve retaining operational control and manufacturing supply of our therapeutic candidates, while our partner could control part of the facility for its own use. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to enter into a biomanufacturing partnership on acceptable terms, or at all. We currently have no agreements or commitments for a manufacturing partnership, and we could determine to advance our manufacturing plans without a partner.
Competition
We are aware of other companies that are developing technologies that may compete with elements of our gene circuit platform technologies, including A2 Biotherapeutics, Inc., Arsenal Biosciences, Inc., Beam Therapeutics Inc., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Encoded Therapeutics, Inc., ImmPACT Bio USA, Inc., Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., MeiraGTx Holdings plc, Obsidian Therapeutics, Inc. and Strand Therapeutics Inc. We are also aware of other companies that are focused on the application of engineered CAR-based immune cell therapies, including NK cells, to oncology, and such competitors include Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., Artiva Biotherapeutics, Inc., Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Century Therapeutics, Inc., Caribou Biosciences, Inc., Catamaran Bio, Inc., Cytovia Therapeutics, Inc., Fate Therapeutics, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Lyell Immunopharma, Inc., Nkarta, Inc., Sana Biotechnology, Inc., Shoreline Biosciences, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company and Vor Biopharma Inc. Some of these companies may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, such as larger research and development staff and well- established marketing and salesforces. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology industry may result in even greater resource concentration among a smaller number of competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, either alone or through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
These companies compete with us in recruiting scientific and managerial talent. Our success will partially depend on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and defend patents and other intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates. Our competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is the foundation of our company and not only defines who we are, but is the lens through which we implement our business strategy and research and development. Our overall strategy is to own and control all intellectual property related to our gene circuits. We protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights through a combination of wholly-owned patent rights, licensed patent rights in particular fields of use, trademark rights, trade secrets and know-how, contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures. Our general strategy includes protecting our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights domestically and in certain key foreign markets. We continually grow and supplement our intellectual property portfolio with new filings and applications not only to strengthen the protection of proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, but also to protect and support the development and commercialization of current and future product candidates. In addition, we seek to protect our technological innovations and branding efforts by filing new patent and trademark applications at the appropriate time and in strategically relevant jurisdictions.
Our patent portfolio relates to our ongoing research and development activities and includes a combination of patents and pending patent applications licensed from third parties, pending patent applications jointly owned with third parties, and patent applications solely owned by us. The patents and pending patent applications in our portfolio can be categorized as relating to our gene circuit platform technologies, including Logic Gating gene circuits, Multi-Arming gene circuits, Regulator Dial gene circuits and Smart Sensor gene circuits; our product candidates, including SENTI-202, SENTI-301A and SENTI-401, as well as other possible pipeline product candidates; and alternative technologies, and our patents and patent application include claims directed to compositions, methods (including preparation, use, or treatment), processes, dosing and formulations. As of February 19, 2023, our in-licensed and owned patent portfolio consists of over 11 issued patents and 148 pending patent applications, of which we own or co-own 3 patents and 120 pending patent applications, and have licensed 8 patents and 28 pending patent applications.
The term of a patent in our patent portfolio varies depending upon a number of factors such as the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date of the patent application to which the patent claims priority. In the United States, 
a term of a patent may be lengthened by patent term adjustment (PTA), which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. In addition, in certain instances, the patent term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for extension to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of clinical trials and the FDA regulatory review period, such extension is referred to as patent term extension (PTE). The restoration period cannot be longer than five years, and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. However there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date of the patent application to which the patent claims priority. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
We also utilize trademark rights to protect our brand and have filed trademark applications for the marks “SENTI,” “SENTI BIOSCIENCES,” “SENTI BIO,” and Senti’s “S” logo in the United States and in certain marks in foreign countries. As of February 19, 2023, we own two United States trademark registrations, five pending and/or allowed United States trademark applications, five foreign trademark registrations, and one pending foreign trademark application. We have also registered multiple internet domain names to further supplement the protection of our brand.
Government Regulation
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, sampling post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. Any product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in those foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences.
U.S. Biologics Regulation
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements, or GLP;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations and any additional requirements for the 
protection of human research subjects and their health information to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency and, if applicable, to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Tissue Practice, or cGTP, requirements for the use of human cellular and tissue products, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs;
•potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. We anticipate filing an IND for Senti-202 in the second half of 2023.
In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are subject to oversight of institutional biosafety committees, or IBCs, as set forth in the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols 
detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages, dose tolerance and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. Completion of these so-called Phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the safety, purity and potency of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a product candidate that is also a human cellular or tissue product, the FDA also will not approve the application if the manufacturer is not in compliance with cGTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate 
to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, new biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic may request that the FDA designate the biologic as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. For 
original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA may require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a biologic or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by FDA, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to FDA for review during the pre-approval period.
In 2017, the FDA established a new regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation, which is intended to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any biologic that meets the following criteria: (i) the biologic qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (ii) the biologic is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (iii) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biologic has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT designation provides all the benefits of breakthrough therapy designation, including more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Product candidates granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of clinical trial sites, including through expansion of trials to additional sites. RMAT-designated products that receive accelerated approval may, as appropriate, fulfill their post-approval requirements through submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence (such as electronic health records); through the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or via post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to approval of such therapy.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and RMAT designation, do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular drug or biologic for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Approval Requirements
Biologics are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products, and those supplying products, ingredients, and components of them, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Changes to the manufacturing process or facility are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
•clinical holds on clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional and medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the 
biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels.
There is also significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan;
•safe, effective and medically necessary;
•appropriate for the specific patient;
•cost-effective; and
•neither experimental nor investigational.
Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Increasingly, third-party payors are 
requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price, or ASP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs.
We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether existing regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals or clearances of our product candidates, if any, may be.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Among the provisions of the ACA, of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following:
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and a cap on the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price;
•extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; and
•a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted.
•The Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent legislation, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress that include aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which remain in effect through 2031. Due to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, 
estimated budget deficit increases resulting from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and subsequent legislation, Medicare payments to providers will be further reduced starting in 2025 absent further legislation. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
•On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
•On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
•On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket spending cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries from $7,050 to $2,000 starting in 2025, thereby effectively eliminating the coverage gap; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D; allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition; require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation; and delay until January 1, 2032 the implementation of the HHS rebate rule that would have limited the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
In addition, President Biden has issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. In addition, in February 2023, HHS issued a proposal in response to an October 2022 executive order from President Biden that includes a proposed prescription drug pricing model that will test whether targeted Medicare payment adjustments will sufficiently incentivize manufacturers to complete confirmatory trials for drugs approved through FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
There has also been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient 
reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial conditions, results of operation and prospects.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our current or future product candidates or additional pricing pressures. 
Any denial in coverage or reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar denial or reduction in payments from private payors, which may prevent us from being able to generate sufficient revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. It is not clear how other future potential changes to the ACA will change the reimbursement model and market outlook for our current and future product candidates.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors, among others, will play a primary role in the prescription and recommendation of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with third-party payors, providers and customers, among others, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the future that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations in the United States and other countries, include the following:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, a person or entity from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease order, arranging for or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs;
•federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties laws, that impose penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a referral made in violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; Manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The federal False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery;
•HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and its implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates and their subcontractors that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there may be additional federal, state, and non-U.S. laws which govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts;
•the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
•federal price reporting laws, which require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on approved products;
•federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;
•the federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Sunshine Act” under the Affordable Care Act, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report to the CMS information related to transfers of value made to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other licensed health care practitioners and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests of physicians and their immediate family members; and
•analogous local, state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to healthcare items or services reimbursed by third party payors, including private insurers, local, state and foreign transparency laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and transfers of value to other healthcare providers and healthcare entities, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to register certain employees engaged in marketing activities in the location and comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a 
clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:
•The second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
•The applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
•The applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from 
country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of February 16, 2023, we had 122 employees, all of whom were full-time, consisting of clinical, research, operations, regulatory, finance and business development personnel. 29 of our employees hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Of our executive officers, seventy-five percent (75%) are people of color and fifty percent (50%) are women. With respect to our employees overall, approximately sixty-nine percent (69%) are people of color and approximately fifty-two percent (52%) are women.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Facilities
We currently occupy approximately 40,000 square feet of office and research and development space in South San Francisco, CA under a lease that expires in April, 2027, with an option to extend for an additional eight years. We also currently occupy 92,000 square feet of manufacturing space under lease agreement that expires in September, 2032, with two five-year options to extend. We believe that this space, collectively, is sufficient to meet our existing needs.
