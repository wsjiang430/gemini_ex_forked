ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview 
Avanos Medical, Inc., formerly Halyard Health, Inc., is a medical technology company focused on delivering clinically superior breakthrough medical device solutions to improve patients’ quality of life. Headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, Avanos is committed to addressing some of today’s most important healthcare needs, such as reducing the use of opioids while helping patients move from surgery to recovery. We develop, manufacture and market clinically superior solutions in more than 90 countries around the globe. 
We provide a portfolio of innovative product offerings focused on respiratory and digestive health, along with surgical and interventional pain management to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care. These products include post-operative pain management solutions, minimally invasive interventional (or chronic) pain therapies, closed airway suction systems and enteral feeding tubes. Products are sold under the ON-Q, COOLIEF, MICROCUFF, MIC-KEY, HOMEPUMP, CORTRAK, GAME READY and other brand names.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Avanos,” “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Avanos Medical, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
On April 30, 2018, we closed the sale of our Surgical and Infection Prevention (“S&IP”) business, which included the name “Halyard Health” (and all variations thereof and related intellectual property rights) and our information technology (“IT”) system (the “Divestiture”) pursuant to an Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement dated April 30, 2018 (“Purchase Agreement”) by and among us and certain of our affiliates and Owens & Minor, Inc. (“Buyer”). The purchase price paid for the Divestiture was $710.0 million plus certain adjustments as provided in the Purchase Agreement, and resulted in a gain of $89.9 million. A portion of the proceeds were used to retire our senior secured term loan (see Note 8, “Debt”). The remaining net proceeds will continue to be invested in the business through acquisitions (see Note 6, “Business Acquisitions”) and organic growth. See “Discontinued Operations” in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
As a focused Medical Devices business, we intend to operate in attractive end-markets. We will deploy a dual-track growth strategy focused on product development and M&A while right-sizing the cost structure of our operations to create a scalable and cost efficient infrastructure. We are engaged in a multi-year restructuring plan to reduce dis-synergies and corporate costs. See “Restructuring” in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
As a result of the Divestiture, the results of operations from our S&IP business are reported as “Income from discontinued operations, net of tax” through April 30, 2018 and the related assets and liabilities are classified as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2017 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report. 
On July 1, 2018, Avanos acquired CoolSystems, Inc., for a purchase price of $65.0 million plus certain adjustments as provided in the purchase agreement (the “Acquisition”). CoolSystems, Inc. is marketed as Game Ready® and is hereinafter referred to as “Game Ready.” The Acquisition was funded using part of the proceeds received from the Divestiture.
Game Ready develops, manufactures and markets the Game Ready® product line, used in pain management and rehabilitation of patients recovering from orthopedic surgery or sports-related injuries. Its product line includes the GRPro® 2.1 cold and compression therapy system; Med4Elite™ multi-modality therapy unit; ATX® Wraps; and a variety of product accessories, all of which complement our existing acute pain management portfolio. Game Ready’s brands have built a strong reputation within the medical community. Their customer base includes some of the world’s leading orthopedic hospitals and athletic organizations, providing us greater access to the orthopedic and sports medicine markets.
The address of our principal executive offices is 5405 Windward Parkway, Suite 100 South, Alpharetta, Georgia 30004, and our telephone number is (844) 428-2667. 
Sales and Marketing 
We direct our primary sales and marketing efforts toward hospitals and other healthcare providers to highlight the unique benefits and competitive differentiation of our branded products. We work directly with physicians, nurses, professional societies, hospital administrators and healthcare group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) to collaborate and educate on emerging practices and clinical techniques. These marketing programs are delivered directly to healthcare providers. Additionally, we provide marketing programs to our strategic distribution partners throughout the world. 
Distribution 
While our products are generally marketed directly to hospitals and other healthcare providers, they are generally sold through third-party wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to healthcare facilities and other end-user customers. In 2018, approximately 46% of our net sales in North America were made through distributors. Globally, sales to Buyer, who is also one 

1

of our distributors, accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales in 2018 and 2017. Buyer purchases our products under standard terms and conditions of sale. 
Outside North America, sales are made either directly to end-user customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. In 2018, approximately 85% of our net sales outside North America were made through wholesalers or distributors. 
We utilize distribution centers in North America, Europe, Australia and Japan. Our distribution centers located in North America transferred to Buyer. However, we will continue to use such distribution centers under a transition services agreement with Buyer until we establish our North America distribution network, which we expect to complete by the end of 2019.
No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.
Group Purchasing Organizations
We enter into agreements with GPOs which allows for the sale of our products to their members, whether sold directly by us or through independent wholesale distributors. GPOs negotiate pricing and volume purchasing discounts for hospitals, physician practices and other health care providers and institutions. Under our agreements with GPOs, we pay a fee based on sales of our products to GPO members, which is recorded as a reduction of net sales. 
Approximately 39% of our 2018 global net sales, including sales to wholesale distributors, were contracted through four major national GPOs. Of these 2018 GPO-contracted sales, 15% were represented by contracts that will expire by the end of 2019, 54% were represented by contracts that will expire between 2020 and 2021 and 31% were represented by contracts that will expire between 2022 and 2023.
Competition 
While no single company competes with us across the breadth of our offerings, we face significant competition in U.S. and international markets. 
There are a variety of treatment means and alternative clinical practices to address the management of surgical and interventional pain management and respiratory and digestive health. We face competition from these alternative treatments, as well as improvements and innovations in products and technologies by our competitors. 
Competitors for our products are fragmented by particular product category, and the individual markets for these products are highly competitive. Major competitors include, among others: 

• | Acute Pain Management: B. Braun Medical Inc., Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Teleflex Incorporated, Ambu A/S, Baxter International, Inc., Pajunk Medical Systems and Leventon


• | Interventional Pain Management: Boston Scientific Corporation, Abbott Laboratories and Stryker Corporation


• | Respiratory Health: Becton, Dickinson and Company, Stryker Corporation and Smiths Medical


• | Digestive Health: Boston Scientific Corporation, Cook Medical, and Applied Medical Technology, Inc.

In developing and emerging markets, alternative clinical practices and different standards of care are our primary competition. 
While we believe that the number of procedures using our products will grow due, in part, to increasing global access to healthcare, we expect that our ability to compete with other providers of similar products will be impacted by rapid technological advances, pricing pressures and third-party reimbursement practices. We continue to defend our market positions and have launched eight new products in 2018. We believe that our key product characteristics, such as proven efficacy, reliability and safety, coupled with our core competencies such as our innovative ability to launch new products, efficient manufacturing processes, established distribution network, field sales organization and customer service, are important factors that distinguish us from our competitors. 
Research and Development 
We continuously engage in research and development to commercialize new products and enhance the effectiveness, reliability and safety of our existing products. We incurred $41.8 million in 2018, $38.2 million in 2017 and $38.4 million in 2016 on research and development for new products and processes, and to improve existing products and processes. These amounts consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, product trial costs, outside laboratory and license fees, the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities and asset write-offs for equipment that does not lead to success in product manufacturing certifications. We intend to increase our research and development efforts as a key strategy for growth. 
We collaborate with physicians to develop solutions that seek to accelerate the global adoption of our therapies and procedures. We are investing to expand the indications for use of our pain products with clinical research and studies and associated new product developments. We are expanding our portfolio with customer-preferred product enhancements, such as next generation 

2

cooled radiofrequency generators and a full line of needles, kits and accessories for continuous peripheral nerve block procedures.
We are also investing in new categories and solutions that complement our technical expertise and existing intellectual property. We are particularly focused on those new categories that we believe will leverage our existing scalable technology platforms as well as our sales and marketing expertise. 
Intellectual Property 
Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property owned by others. 
We hold numerous patents and have numerous patent applications pending in the United States and other countries that relate to the technology used in many of our products. We utilize patents in our surgical pain management, interventional pain management, respiratory health and digestive health products. These patents generally expire between 2019 and 2037. None of the patents we license from third parties are material to our business.
Under an agreement that we have with Buyer, we may continue to distribute products bearing the “Halyard Health” or “Halyard” brands through the end of 2020 as we continue rebranding efforts to ensure our customers’ transition from the Halyard brand. 
We consider the patents and trademarks which we own and the trademarks under which we sell certain of our products, as a whole, to be material to our business. However, we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark. 
Raw Materials 
We use a wide variety of raw materials and other inputs in our production processes. We base our purchasing decisions on quality assurance, cost effectiveness and regulatory requirements, and we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. We primarily purchase these materials from external suppliers, some of which are single-source suppliers. 
Regulatory Matters 
The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of our products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. Our operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. 
Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects our business. Among other effects, healthcare regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. For example, in the United States, before we can market a new medical product, or market a new use for, claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we generally must first receive clearance under Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“510(k) clearance”) from the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). In order for us to obtain 510(k) clearance, the FDA must determine that our proposed product is substantially equivalent to a device legally on the market, known as a predicate device, with respect to intended use, technology, safety and effectiveness. Similarly, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States also require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. For instance, the European Commission, or EC, has harmonized national regulations for the control of medical devices through European Medical Device Directives with which manufacturers must comply. Under these regulations, manufacturing plants must have received certification of conformity from a notified body in order to be able to sell products within the member states of the European Union. Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a “CE” mark. Products covered by the EC regulations that do not bear the CE mark may not be sold or distributed in the European Union.

We expect compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. 
In addition to regulatory initiatives, our business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of healthcare products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. 
Access to healthcare products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce healthcare costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by healthcare payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. We expect insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of healthcare products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of healthcare products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on our products for the foreseeable future. 
We expect debate to continue during the next several years at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery, and payment for healthcare products and services. We believe that future legislation and regulation in the markets we serve could affect access to healthcare products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for healthcare products and services, change healthcare delivery systems, create new fees and obligations, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which we or the healthcare industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. 
Since we market our products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action. 
Demand for many of our existing and new medical devices is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business. Statutory and regulatory requirements for Medicaid, Medicare, and other government healthcare programs govern provider reimbursement levels. From time to time, legislative changes are made to government healthcare programs that impact our business, and the federal and/or state governments may continue to enact measures in the future aimed at containing or reducing reimbursement levels for medical expenses paid for in whole or in part with government funds. We cannot predict the nature of such measures or their impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any reduction in the amount of reimbursements received by our customers could harm our business by reducing their selection of our products and the prices they are willing to pay. 
Employee and Labor Relations 
In our worldwide operations, we had approximately 4,700 employees as of December 31, 2018. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
Our operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental, health and safety matters. Our operations are in compliance with, or we are taking actions designed to ensure compliance with, these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims concerning non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or standards, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with those claims. We are not currently named as a party in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to environmental, health and safety matters. 
While we have incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, we believe that our future cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, and our exposure to liability for environmental, health and safety claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by us (including currently unknown contamination and contamination caused by prior owners and 

4

operators of such sites or other waste generators) may give rise to additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
