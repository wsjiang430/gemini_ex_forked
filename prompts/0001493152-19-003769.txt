As used in this report, the terms “Lazydays,” the “Company,” “Holdco,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Lazydays Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.
 
Company History
 
We were formed under the name “Andina Acquisition Corp. II” as an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on July 1, 2015 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses.
 
From the consummation of our initial public offering until October 27, 2017, we were searching for a suitable target business to acquire. On October 27, 2017, a merger agreement was entered into by and among Andina Acquisition Corp. II (“Andina”), Andina II Holdco Corp. (“Holdco”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Andina, Andina II Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco (“Merger Sub”), Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc. (and its subsidiaries), a Delaware corporation (“Lazydays RV”), and solely for certain purposes set forth in the merger agreement, A. Lorne Weil (the “Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provided for a business combination transaction by means of (i) the merger of Andina with and into Holdco, with Holdco surviving, changing its name to Lazydays Holdings, Inc. and becoming a new public company (the “Redomestication Merger”) and (ii) the merger of Lazydays RV with and into Merger Sub with Lazydays RV surviving and becoming a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco (the “Transaction Merger” and together with the Redomestication Merger, the “Mergers”). On March 15, 2018, we held an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, at which the Andina shareholders approved the Mergers and other related proposals. On the same date, we closed the Mergers. In connection with the Mergers, our business became the business of Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc. and its subsidiaries. As a result of the Mergers, the Company’s stockholders and the shareholders of Andina became stockholders of Holdco and we changed the name of Holdco to “Lazydays Holdings, Inc.”

The Company operates Recreation Vehicle (“RV”) dealerships and offers a comprehensive portfolio of products and services for RV owners and outdoor enthusiasts. The Company generates revenue by providing RV owners and outdoor enthusiasts a full spectrum of products: RV sales, RV-parts and services, financing and insurance products, third-party protection plans, after-market parts and accessories, RV rentals and RV camping. The Company provides these offerings through its Lazydays branded dealerships. Lazydays is known nationally as The RV Authority™, a registered trademark that has been consistently used by the Company in its marketing and branding communications since 2013.
 
The Company believes, based on industry research and management’s estimates, it operates one of the world’s largest RV dealerships, measured in terms of on-site inventory, located on 126 acres outside Tampa, Florida. The Company also has dealerships located in Tucson, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Loveland and Denver, Colorado. Lazydays offers one of the largest selections of leading RV brands in the nation featuring more than 3,000 new and pre-owned RVs. The Company has nearly 400 service bays across all locations and has RV parts and accessories stores at all locations. Lazydays also has RV rental fleets in Florida and Colorado and availability to two on-site campgrounds with over 700 RV campsites. The Company welcomes over 500,000 visitors to its dealership locations annually and employs over 800 people at the six facilities. The Company’s dealership locations are staffed with knowledgeable local team members, providing customers access to extensive RV expertise. The Company believes its dealership locations are strategically located in key RV markets. Based on information collected by the Company from reports prepared by Statistical Surveys, these key RV markets (Florida, Colorado, Arizona, Minnesota and Tennessee) account for a significant portion of new RV units sold on an annual basis in the U.S. The Company’s dealerships in these key markets attract customers from all states, except Hawaii.
 
The Company attracts new customers primarily through Lazydays dealership locations as well as digital and traditional marketing efforts. Once the Company acquires customers through a transaction, those customers become part of the Company’s customer database where the Company leverages customized customer relationship management (“CRM”) tools and analytics to actively engage, market and sell its products and services.

Recent Developments
 
On December 6, 2018, Lazydays completed its asset purchase of Tennessee RV Supercenter near Knoxville, Tennessee. The assets and liabilities purchased consisted primarily of inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, accounts payable, floor plan liabilities, and the certificates, permits, approvals and licenses pertaining to the dealership properties. The total consideration paid for the net acquired assets was $24.7 million consisting of cash, the acquisition of the floor plan liabilities (which is included as a component of net assets acquired in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), and a note due to the owner of Tennessee RV (the “Seller Note”). The Seller Note of approximately $4.1 million accrues interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum, and in the case of an event of default, increases to 8.0% per annum until the event of default is cured. Pursuant to the terms of the Seller Note, the Company shall make monthly payments of principal and interest of approximately $0.1 million through the fourth anniversary of the Seller Note at which time any residual accrued principal and interest shall be due and payable. Additionally, the purchase price is subject to a final net working capital adjustment after the closing date. If the final net working capital exceeds the estimated net working capital adjustment threshold, the Company shall pay to the seller such excess and if the final net working capital is less than the estimated net working capital adjustment threshold, the amount of such deficiency will be set-off against the next required payment under the Seller Note.
 
Also on December 6, 2018, LDRV Holdings Corp., Lazydays RV America, LLC, Lazydays RV Discount, LLC, Lazydays Mile HI RV, LLC, and Lazydays of Minneapolis LLC (the “Borrowers” pursuant to the credit agreement, dated as of March 15, 2018 (the “Credit Agreement”), as amended pursuant to the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2018 with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”)) entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (“Second Amendment”) with M&T Bank. The Second Amendment increases the Letter of Credit Sublimit from $0.5 million to $1.0 million, increases the dollar limit on unsecured indebtedness from $5.0 million to $15.0 million, and makes certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement.
 
During December 2018, the Company consolidated its six acre operation located in Longmont, CO into its nearby Loveland, CO location. The costs associated were not material to the consolidated statements of operations.
 
During January 2019, we exchanged $0.5 million to purchase an aggregate of 400,000 unit purchase options as permitted under the terms of the unit purchase options, and as a result the unit purchase options and any obligation to issue any underlying securities were cancelled. See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Lazydays Product and Service Offerings
 
New and Used Vehicles
 
New Vehicles: Lazydays offers a comprehensive selection of new RVs across almost the entire range of price points, classes and floor plans, from entry level travel trailers to Class A diesel pushers, at its dealership locations and on its website. Lazydays has formed strategic alliances with leading RV manufacturers. The core brands that the Company sells, representing 92.1% of the new vehicles that were sold by the Company in 2018, are manufactured by Thor Industries, Winnebago Industries, Forest River, Inc., and Tiffin Motorhomes.

-


Used Vehicles: Lazydays sells a comprehensive selection of used RVs at its dealership locations. The primary source of used RVs is through trade-ins associated with the sale of new and used RVs. Lazydays is also very active in the used RV market and its extensive RV knowledge and experience allows Lazydays to buy used RVs at attractive prices. Used RVs are generally reconditioned in the Company’s service departments prior to sale. Used RVs that do not meet the Company’s standards for retail sale are wholesaled.
 
Dealership Finance and Insurance
 
Vehicle financing: Lazydays arranges for financing for vehicle purchases through third-party financing sources in exchange for a commission payable to it. Lazydays does not directly finance its customers’ purchases, and its exposure to loss in connection with these financing arrangements generally is limited to the commissions that it receives. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company arranged financing transactions for a majority of the total number of new and used units sold.
 
Protection Plans: Lazydays offers a variety of third-party protection plans and services to the purchasers of its RVs as part of the delivery process, including extended vehicle service contracts, tire and wheel protection, guaranteed auto protection (known as “GAP”, this protection covers the shortfall between a customer’s loan balance and insurance payoff in the event of a casualty) and property insurance. These products are primarily underwritten and administered by independent third parties. Lazydays is primarily compensated on a straight commission basis. The Company may be charged back (“charge-backs”) for financing fees, insurance or vehicle service contract commissions in the event of early termination of the contracts by the customers.
 
Parts and Services and Other
 
Repair and Maintenance: In addition to preparing RVs for delivery to customers, Lazydays’ service and repair operations, with nearly 400 service bays, provide onsite general RV maintenance and repair services at all of the Company’s dealership locations. Lazydays employs over 180 highly skilled technicians, with many of them being certified with the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (“RVIA”) or the National RV Dealers Association (“RVDA”). The Company is equipped to offer comprehensive services and perform OEM warranty repairs for most RV components. The Company also maintains a body shop, cabinet shop, chassis shop and windshield and glass repair shop with specialized equipment and facilities at its Tampa location.
 
Installation of parts and accessories: Lazydays’ full-service repair facilities enable Lazydays to install all parts and accessories sold at its dealership locations, including, among other items, towing and hitching products, satellite systems, braking systems, leveling systems and appliances. While other RV dealerships may be able to install RV parts and accessories and other retailers may be able to sell certain parts and accessories, Lazydays believes its ability to both sell and install necessary parts and accessories affords the Company a competitive advantage over online retailers and big box retailers that do not have service centers designed to accommodate RVs, and other RV dealerships that do not offer a comprehensive inventory of parts and accessories.
 
Collision repair: Lazydays offers collision repair services in all markets and the Company’s Tampa, Florida, Tucson, Arizona, Loveland, Colorado, and Knoxville, Tennessee locations are equipped with full body paint booths. Lazydays’ facilities are equipped to offer a wide selection of collision repair services, including fiberglass front and rear cap replacement, windshield replacement, interior remodel solutions and paint work. The Company can perform collision repair services for a wide array of insurance carriers.
 
Parts and Accessories Store: With sizable parts and accessories inventory, in addition to a fully stocked onsite retail and accessory stores and access through the Lazydays’ networks for hard to find parts, Lazydays provides new and pre-owned RV buyers the option of dealer installed accessories, such as tow hitches, satellite dishes and specialized suspension systems that can be included in each buyer’s financing or aftermarket through the Lazydays retail store footprint. The Company believes that its Tampa, Florida Accessories & More store is among the largest aftermarket parts and accessories stores in the state of Florida.
 
RV Rentals: Lazydays offers consumers interested in the RV lifestyle a fleet of vehicles available for rent. Lazydays’ rentals offer comprehensive amenities allowing for a more premier camping experience and an introduction to the RV lifestyle. Lazydays offers unlimited mileage and trip planning services and add-ons such as outdoor living, kitchen and linen packages.

RV Campground: Lazydays also operates the Lazydays RV Resort at its Tampa, Florida location. Also known as the Lazydays RV Campground, the Lazydays RV Resort includes amenities designed to allow guests to relax, unwind, and enjoy fun activities as a family. The resort offers 300 RV sites with full 50-amp hookups, a full-time activities coordinator, sports courts, trolley service to and from the Lazydays dealership, and a screened and heated pool. The resort also offers rental units that can comfortably accommodate up to 6 people with one and a half bathrooms, full indoor and outdoor kitchens and other amenities. The resort also operates on-site restaurants.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Grow the Company’s Customer Base. Lazydays believes its strong brands, market position, ongoing investment in its service platform, broad product portfolio and full array of RV offerings will continue to provide it with competitive advantages in targeting and capturing a larger share of consumers in addition to the growing number of new RV enthusiasts that will enter the market. The Company continuously works to attract new customers to its dealership locations through targeted integrated digital and traditional marketing efforts, attractive offerings and access to its wide array of resources for RV enthusiasts. The Company has focused specifically on marketing to the fast-growing demographics of retiring baby boomers and younger millennial and Generation X market entrants. The Company also markets to these segments through partnership marketing efforts and its sponsorships of college and professional athletic events, music festivals, motorsports events, RV campsites across the country, and other RV lifestyle efforts.
 
Dealership Location Acquisitions. The RV dealership industry is highly fragmented with many independent RV dealers. The Company has used, and plans to continue to use, acquisitions of independent dealers as an alternative to new dealership location openings to expand its business and grow the Company’s customer base. Lazydays believes its experience and scale allow it to operate acquired locations efficiently. During 2018, Lazydays acquired Shorewood RV Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Tennessee RV Supercenter near Knoxville, Tennessee. Lazydays intends to continue to pursue acquisitions that will grow its customer base and present attractive risk-adjusted returns and significant value-creation opportunities.
 
Greenfield Dealership Locations. Lazydays may establish dealership locations in new and existing markets to expand its customer base. Target markets and locations are identified by employing proprietary data and analytical tools. The Company believes there is ample white space for additional development opportunities. The Company intends to open greenfield sites that will grow its customer base and present attractive risk-adjusted returns and significant value-creation opportunities.
 
Service and Collision. Lazydays believes that its service and repair capabilities represent a significant opportunity for incremental revenue growth, especially as the Company grows geographically. Lazydays frequently welcomes customers who travel from across the country to have their vehicles serviced by Lazydays’ team of service and repair professionals. As a result, the service and repair department serves as a means of attracting potential customers to the Lazydays facilities and offers greater additional sales opportunities for Lazydays.
 
Parts and Accessories Store “Accessories & More”. Aftermarket RV parts and accessories are typically under-represented at RV dealerships. The Company believes that parts and accessories are an important part of the RV lifestyle and serve to engage customers with the Lazydays brand outside of the typical RV buying and servicing cycle. The Company understands that RV owners need a reliable resource for RV necessities and products that make their camping experience more enjoyable. Lazydays stores have expansive offerings and provide access to RV product experts to assist RV owners in their RV lifestyle needs. Lazydays believes that the “Accessories & More” offering encompasses all of the needs of the RV consumer.
 
RV Rentals. Renting RVs continues to grow in popularity as a cost-effective vacation alternative. Lazydays has a fleet of vehicles available for rental at 3 dealership locations, one in Florida and two in Colorado. The Company’s rental vehicles have a robust amenity offering and the Company’s value proposition includes unlimited mileage, add-ons and trip planning for consumers resulting in a superior rental experience. Lazydays believes that RV rentals drive interest in the RV lifestyle and provides an opportunity to introduce new customers to the Lazydays brand. Lazydays is well positioned to take advantage of this growing opportunity.
 
Leverage the Company’s scale and cost structure to improve operating efficiency. As Lazydays grows, it is positioned to leverage its scale to achieve competitive operating margins. The Company manages its new and used RV inventories so that its dealerships’ supply and mix of vehicles are in line with seasonal sales trends and minimize the Company’s carrying costs. In addition, the Company leverages its scale to reduce costs related to purchasing certain equipment, supplies, and services through national vendor relationships.

Customers and Markets
 
The RV industry is characterized by RV enthusiasts’ investment in, and steadfast commitment to, the RV lifestyle. The estimated number of U.S. households that own an RV is approximately 9 million.
 
Owners invest in insurance, extended service contracts, parts and accessories, roadside assistance and regular maintenance to protect and maintain their RVs. They typically invest in new accessories and the necessary installation costs as they upgrade their RVs. They also spend on services and resources as they plan, engage in, and return from their road trips. Furthermore, based on industry research and management’s estimates, the Company believes that RV owners typically trade-in to buy another RV every four to five years.
 
Per the RV Industry Association’s (RVIA) December 2018 survey of manufacturers, total RV wholesale shipments ended 2018 with 483,672 units, down (-4.1%) compared to the 504,599 units in 2017. The shipment total for 2018 was the second highest on comparable record. Towable RVs were down (-3.6%) at 426,087 units; motorhome shipments were down (-8.1%) at 57,585 units, compared to 2017 shipment totals. Generally, used RVs are sold at a lower price level than comparable new RVs and the sale of used RVs has historically been more stable through business cycles than the sale of new vehicles.
 
Lazydays believes RV trips remain the least expensive type of vacation and allow RV owners to travel more while spending less. RV trips offer savings on a variety of vacation costs, including, among others, airfare, lodging and dining. While fuel costs are a component of the overall vacation cost, the Company believes fluctuations in fuel prices are not a significant factor affecting a family’s decision to take RV trips. Based on RVIA information, the average annual mileage use of an RV is between 3,000 and 5,000 miles.
 
Competition
 
The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in the RV industry are breadth and depth of product selection, value pricing, convenient dealership locations, technical services, customer service, and overall experience. The Company competes directly and/or indirectly with RV dealers, RV service providers, RV rental operators, and RV parts and accessories retailers. One of the Company’s direct competitors, Camping World Holdings, Inc., is publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Additional competitors may enter the businesses in which the Company currently operates.
Lazydays RV Dealerships
 
The Company operates six Lazydays dealership locations across five states. The Company’s dealership locations are strategically located in key RV markets. Based on information collected by the Company from reports prepared by Statistical Surveys, these key RV markets of Florida, Colorado, Arizona, Minnesota and Tennessee account for a significant portion of new RV units sold on an annual basis in the U.S. The Company’s dealerships in these key markets attract customers from all states, except Hawaii. Generally, the Company’s dealership locations provide RV repair and installation services, collision repair, parts, and accessories for RVs and RV enthusiasts, RV rentals and all of the Company’s locations sell new and used RVs. The Company believes its dealership strategy of offering a comprehensive range of RV parts, services, accessories, products, rentals and new and used RVs, generates powerful cross-selling opportunities.
Dealership Design and Layout
 
The Company’s operating dealership locations range in size from approximately 14,000 to 384,000 square feet and are situated on 11 to 126 acres. The Company’s dealership locations feature service centers staffed with expert, in-house trained product specialists and are equipped with merchandise demonstrations to assist in educating customers about RV performance products. The Company’s dealership locations also provide opportunities to promote a more interactive and consultative selling environment. The Lazydays staff is trained to cross-sell and explain the benefits of the Company’s breadth of services, protection plans and products to which the Company’s customers have become accustomed, such as extended service contracts, emergency roadside assistance products, club memberships, discount camping and travel assistance.

The Company regularly refreshes its dealership locations to enhance the customers’ shopping experience and maximize product and service offerings. New products and services are introduced to capitalize on the advances of the RV industry and to satisfy needs of the Company’s customers. Store dress, promotional signage and directional signage are also periodically refreshed to further enhance the Lazydays customer shopping experience at Lazydays dealership locations.
 
Expansion Opportunities and Site Selection
 
The Company’s disciplined expansion and acquisition strategy focuses on growing its geographic footprint and customer base. The Company believes it has developed a rigorous and flexible process that employs exclusive data and analytical tools to identify target markets for acquisitions and new dealership openings. The Company evaluates acquisition opportunities or selects sites for new locations based on criteria such as local demographics, traffic patterns, proximity to RV parks and campgrounds, proximity to major interstates, analytics from the Company’s customer database, RV sales and registrations, product availability and availability of attractive acquisition and/or lease terms. Members of the Lazydays development team spend considerable time evaluating markets and prospective sites.
Dealership Management and Training
 
The Company’s Vice President, National General Manager oversees all dealership operations. He has over 38 years of experience in the RV industry and has been employed by Lazydays for over 5 years.
 
Each dealership location employs a General Manager or a General Sales Manager (in either case, the “GM”) that has responsibility for the daily operations of the dealership location. Areas of responsibility include inventory management, hiring, associate training and development, maintenance of the facilities, customer service and customer satisfaction. A GM’s management team includes a sales manager, a parts and accessories manager, a service manager, and a finance and insurance manager to help oversee the operations of each dealership location department. A typical Lazydays dealership location employs approximately 30 to 100 full-time equivalent employees.
 
The Company employs a Vice President, Operations and Supply Chain, and a centralized inventory management team to oversee the Company’s RV inventory and provide consistency and controls in the forecasting, ordering, purchasing and distribution of RV inventory.
 
The Company employs a Vice President of Service who has responsibility for the service operations of the dealership locations. His responsibilities include ensuring efficiency, logistics, and scheduling of service operations to deliver a premium customer experience.
 
The Company is constantly seeking to add top talent by partnering with local school districts, trade schools, military bases and community organizations. The interview process identifies current and future candidates with the goal of hiring talented people that are customer focused. The Company identifies hard to fill positions and has taken a proactive approach to creating viable candidates with its Tech U and Sales U programs. Through its Tech U and Sales U programs, the Company enrolls students with technical aptitude and provides them training to successfully complete industry certification courses and prepare them for a career as an RV technician or a successful sales partner.
 
Once hired, the Company continues to provide extensive training programs and opportunities for its employees, including, among others, new-hire training and orientations, institutionalized monthly e-learning and training modules, and certification programs for the Company’s RV technicians.

Product Sourcing and Distribution
 
Sourcing
 
New and Used RVs
 
The Company generally acquires new RVs for retail sale directly from the applicable manufacturer. Lazydays has strategic contractual arrangements with many of the leading RV manufacturers. Lazydays maintains a central inventory management and purchasing group to manage and maintain adequate inventory levels and mix. RVs are transported directly from a manufacturer’s facility to Lazydays dealership locations via a third-party transportation company.
 
Lazydays’ strategy is to partner with financially sound manufacturers that make quality products, have adequate manufacturing capacity and distribution, and maintain an appropriate product mix.
 
Lazydays’ supply arrangements with OEMs are typically governed by dealer agreements, which are customary in the RV industry. The Company’s dealer agreements with OEMs are generally made on a location-by-location basis. The terms of these dealer agreements are typically subject to Lazydays, among other things, meeting all the requirements and conditions of the dealer agreement, maintaining certain sales objectives, performing services and repairs for owners of the manufacturer’s RVs that are still under manufacturer warranty, carrying the manufacturer’s parts and accessories needed to service and repair the manufacturer’s RVs in stock at all times, actively advertising and promoting the manufacturer’s RVs and indemnifying the manufacturer under certain circumstances. Lazydays’ dealer agreements generally designate a specific geographic territory, exclusive to Lazydays, provided that Lazydays meets the material obligations of the dealer agreement. Wholesale pricing is generally established on a model year basis and is subject to change in the manufacturer’s sole discretion. In certain cases, the manufacturer may also establish a suggested retail price, below which the Company cannot advertise that manufacturer’s RVs.
 
Lazydays generally acquires used RVs from customers, primarily through trade-ins, as well as through private sales, auctions, the Company’s rental inventory and other sources, and the Company generally reconditions used RVs acquired for retail sale in its parts and service departments. Used RVs that Lazydays does not sell at Lazydays dealership locations generally are sold at wholesale prices through auctions.
 
Lazydays finances the purchase of substantially all of the Company’s new RV inventory from OEMs through the floor plan facility. Used vehicles may also be financed from time to time through the floor plan facility. For more information on the floor plan facility, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — M&T Credit Facility” below.
 
Parts and Accessories
 
The purchasing activities for the Company’s parts and accessories departments are focused on RV maintenance products, outdoor lifestyle products, RV parts and accessories, such as, among other things, generators and electrical, satellite receivers and GPS systems, towing and hitching products and RV appliances, essential supplies and other products and services necessary or desirable for the RV lifestyle. The Company maintains central purchasing functions to manage inventory, product-planning, allocate merchandise to the Company’s dealership locations and oversee the replenishment of basic merchandise. The Company has no long-term purchase commitments. The Company leverages its scale to reduce costs related to purchasing certain equipment, supplies, and services through long-standing, continuous relationships with its largest vendors.
Marketing and Advertising
 
The Company markets its product offerings through integrated marketing campaigns across all digital and traditional marketing disciplines, with an emphasis on digital. The Company’s marketing efforts include its website, paid and organic search efforts, email, social media, online blog and video content, television, radio, billboards, direct mail, telemarketing, retail point of sale, promotional events, RV shows and rallies, advertisements in national and regional industry publications, vendor co-op advertising programs and personal solicitations and referrals. Lazydays also has numerous exclusive sponsorship and partnership relationships with various RV lifestyle properties and events, including college sports teams, National Football League teams, music festivals, RV campsites across the country, motorsports events, and others. The Company currently has a segmented marketing database of over 3.2 million RV owners and prospects. Lazydays’ principal marketing strategy is to capitalize on its broad name recognition, unique brand positioning, extensive product selection, differentiated value proposition and exclusive benefits, and high quality customer experience among RV owners. As per a research report prepared by Russell Research in November / December 2017, over 70% of Lazydays customers and over 60% of prospective customers surveyed strongly agree that Lazydays provides a high quality customer experience.

Lazydays strives to exceed expectations by providing the best overall customer experience throughout every interaction with the Company. The Company believes customer service and access to a live person is a critical component of Lazydays’ digital marketing, sales, service and rental operations, and to achieving a best-in-class customer experience. The Company’s sales and customer service centers are multi-channel, full-service contact centers. RV enthusiasts can visit Lazydays’ locations, call, email, internet chat, text and use social media to contact Lazydays regarding products, services, protection plans, rentals, concerns and anything else related to the RV lifestyle. RV enthusiasts can also speak with Lazydays’ customer service specialists for help with aftermarket accessory orders, installations, scheduling, answers to questions, and to make purchases for any product and install services offered through the Lazydays website.
 
Lazydays’ contact center specialists are extensively trained to assist customers with complex orders and provide a level of service that leads to long-term customer relationships. In addition, Lazydays’ quality assurance team monitors contacts daily and provides the leadership team with tools to maintain sales and service standards. With low turnover, the Company retains employees longer than the industry average, which the Company believes allows its callers to be assisted by experienced contact center agents who are familiar with the RV lifestyle and Lazydays’ services, protection plans and products.

Government Regulation
 
The Company’s operations are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation, including the Company’s RV sales, vehicle financing, outbound telemarketing, email, direct mail, roadside assistance programs, extended vehicle service contracts and insurance activities. These laws and regulations include consumer protection laws, so-called “lemon laws,” privacy laws, escheatment laws, anti-money laundering laws and other extensive laws and regulations applicable to new and used vehicle dealers, as well as a variety of other laws and regulations. These laws also include federal and state wage and hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws.
Motor Vehicle Laws and Regulations
 
The Company’s operations are subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation and the rules and regulations of various state motor vehicle regulatory agencies. The Company is also subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation and marketing of motor vehicles. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators’ various restrictions on the weight, length and width of motor vehicles that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions. Federal and state authorities also have various environmental control standards relating to air, water, noise pollution and hazardous waste generation and disposal.
 
The Company’s financing activities with customers are subject to federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, leasing laws, installment finance laws, usury laws and other installment sales and leasing laws and regulations, some of which regulate finance and other fees and charges that may be imposed or received in connection with motor vehicle retail installment sales.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“BCFP”), an independent federal agency funded by the United States Federal Reserve with broad regulatory powers and limited oversight from the United States Congress. Although automotive dealers are generally excluded, the Dodd-Frank Act could lead to additional, indirect regulation of automotive dealers, in particular, their sale and marketing of finance and insurance products, through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions. In March 2013, the BCFP issued supervisory guidance highlighting its concern that the practice of automotive dealers being compensated for arranging customer financing through discretionary markup of wholesale rates offered by financial institutions (“dealer markup”) results in a significant risk of pricing disparity in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”). The BCFP recommended that financial institutions under its jurisdiction take steps to address compliance with the ECOA, which may include imposing controls on dealer markup, monitoring and addressing the effects of dealer markup policies, and eliminating dealer discretion to markup buy rates.

Insurance Laws and Regulations
 
As a marketer of insurance programs, the Company is subject to state rules and regulations governing the business of insurance including, without limitation, laws governing the administration, underwriting, marketing, solicitation and/or sale of insurance programs. The insurance carriers that underwrite the programs that the Company sells are required to file their rates for approval by state regulators. Additionally, certain state laws and regulations govern the form and content of certain disclosures that must be made in connection with the sale, advertising or offering of any insurance program to a consumer. The Company is required to maintain certain licenses to market insurance programs.
Marketing Laws and Regulations
 
The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and each of the states have enacted consumer protection statutes designed to ensure that consumers are protected from unfair and deceptive marketing practices. Lazydays reviews all of its marketing materials for compliance with applicable FTC regulations and state marketing laws.
Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
 
The Company’s operations involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling and/or disposal of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires and propane. Consequently, the Company’s business is subject to a variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate the environment and public health and safety.
 
Most of the Lazydays dealership locations utilize aboveground storage tanks, and to a lesser extent underground storage tanks, primarily for petroleum-based products. Storage tanks are subject to periodic testing, containment, upgrading and removal requirements under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its state law counterparts. Clean-up or other remedial action may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from storage tanks or other sources. In addition, water quality protection programs under the federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act), the Safe Drinking Water Act and comparable state and local programs govern certain discharges from some of the Company’s operations. Similarly, air emissions from the Company’s operations, such as RV painting, are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and related state and local laws. Certain health and safety standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor and related state agencies also apply to certain of the Company’s operations.
 
Although the Company incurs costs to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of its business, the Company does not presently anticipate that these costs will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company does not have any material known environmental commitments or contingencies.
 
Insurance
 
The Company utilizes insurance to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, product liability, general liability, business interruption, property liability, director and officers’ liability, cyber, environmental issues, vehicle liability and employee health-care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other assumptions. The Company’s results could be adversely affected by claims and other expenses related to such plans and policies if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, Lazydays had approximately 880 employees, including approximately 850 full-time employees. None of the Lazydays employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and Lazydays has not had any labor-related work stoppages. The Company believes that its employee relations are in good standing.
