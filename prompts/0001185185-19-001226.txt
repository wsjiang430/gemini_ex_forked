Item 1. Business
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, U.S. Global Investors, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “U.S. Global” or the “Company”) may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements. Forward-looking statements include statements as to industry trends, future expectations of the Company, and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts and are based on certain assumptions by management. These statements are often identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “could,” “should,” “estimate,” or “continue,” and similar expressions or variations. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Company management based on information currently available to management. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, among others, the risks described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and elsewhere in this report and other documents filed or furnished by U.S. Global from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). U.S. Global cautions readers to carefully consider such factors. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made. Except to the extent required by applicable law, U.S. Global undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements.

Lines of Business
-----------------

Investment Management Services
 
Investment Advisory Services. The Company furnishes an investment program for each of the clients it manages and determines, subject to overall supervision by the applicable board of trustees of the clients, the clients’ investments pursuant to an advisory agreement. Consistent with the investment restrictions, objectives and policies of the particular client, the portfolio team for each client determines what investments should be purchased, sold, and held, and makes changes in the portfolio deemed necessary or appropriate. In the advisory agreement, the Company is charged with seeking the best overall terms in executing portfolio transactions and selecting brokers or dealers.
 
As required by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“Investment Company Act”), the advisory agreement with USGIF is subject to annual renewal and is terminable upon 60-day notice. The Board of Trustees of USGIF will meet to consider the agreement renewal in September 2019. Management anticipates that the advisory agreement will be renewed.

In addition to providing advisory services to USGIF, the Company provides advisory services to two ETFs. U.S. Global Jets ETF commenced operations in April 2015, and U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF commenced operations in June 2017.

Competition
-----------

 
The mutual fund industry is highly competitive. According to the Investment Company Institute, at the end of 2018 there were approximately 9,600 domestically registered open-end investment companies and approximately 2,100 exchange-traded funds of varying sizes and investment policies, whose shares are being offered to the public in the U.S. In addition to competition from other mutual fund managers and investment advisers, the Company and the mutual fund industry are in competition with various investment alternatives offered by insurance companies, banks, securities broker-dealers, and other financial institutions. Many of these institutions are able to engage in more liberal advertising than mutual funds and ETFs and may offer accounts at competitive interest rates, which may be insured by federally chartered corporations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 
A number of mutual fund groups are significantly larger than the funds managed by U.S. Global, offer a greater variety of investment objectives and have greater resources to promote the sale of investments therein. However, the Company believes it has the resources, products, and personnel to compete with these other mutual funds. In particular, the Company is known for its expertise in the gold mining and exploration, natural resources and emerging markets. Competition for sales of fund shares is influenced by various factors, including investment objectives and performance, advertising and sales promotional efforts, distribution channels, and the types and quality of services offered to fund shareholders.
 
Success in the investment advisory business is substantially dependent on each fund’s investment performance, the quality of services provided to shareholders, and the Company’s efforts to market the Funds and other clients effectively. Sales of Fund shares generate management and administrative services fees (which are based on the assets of the Funds). Costs of distribution and compliance continue to put pressure on profit margins for the mutual fund industry.
 
Despite the Company’s expertise in gold mining and exploration, natural resources, and emerging markets, the Company faces the same obstacle many advisers face, namely uncovering undervalued investment opportunities as the markets face further uncertainty and increased volatility. In addition, the growing number of alternative investments, especially in specialized areas, has created pressure on the profit margins and increased competition for available investment opportunities.
 

Supervision and Regulation
--------------------------

 
The Company and the clients the Company manages and administers operate under certain laws, including federal and state securities laws, governing their organization, registration, operation, legal, financial, and tax status. Among the potential penalties for violation of the laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries are fines, imprisonment, injunctions, revocation of registration, and certain additional administrative sanctions. Any determination that the Company or its management has violated applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. Moreover, there is no assurance that changes to existing laws, regulations, or rulings promulgated by governmental entities having jurisdiction over the Company and its clients will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company has no control over regulatory rulemaking or the consequences it may have on the mutual fund and investment advisory industry.
 
Regulatory pronouncements and oversight have significantly increased the burden of compliance infrastructure with respect to the mutual fund industry and the capital markets. This momentum of regulations has contributed significantly to the costs of managing and administering mutual funds.
 
U.S. Global is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. As a registered investment adviser, it is subject to the requirements of the Advisers Act, and the SEC’s regulations thereunder, as well as to examination by the SEC’s staff. The Advisers Act imposes substantive regulation on virtually all aspects of the Company’s business and relationships with the Company’s clients. Applicable rules relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, transactions with clients, effective compliance programs, conflicts of interest, advertising, recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure requirements. The Funds and the ETFs for which the Company acts as the investment adviser are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. The Investment Company Act imposes additional obligations, including detailed operational requirements for both funds and their advisers. Moreover, an investment adviser’s contract with a registered fund may be terminated by the fund on not more than 60 days’ notice and is subject to annual renewal by the fund’s board after an initial two-year term. Both the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act regulate the “assignment” of advisory contracts by the investment adviser. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. The failure of the Company, or the Funds and ETFs which the Company advises, to comply with the requirements of the SEC could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is also subject to federal and state laws affecting corporate governance, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“S-Ox Act”), as well as rules adopted by the SEC.

U.S. Global is required to keep and maintain certain reports and records, which must be made available to the SEC upon request.
 
Galileo Global Equity Advisors Inc. (“Galileo”) is registered as a portfolio manager and investment fund manager with the Ontario Securities Commission (“OSC”). As a registered portfolio manager, the OSC imposes substantive regulation on virtually all aspects of Galileo's business and relationships with Galileo’s clients. Applicable legislation relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, transactions with clients, effective compliance programs, conflicts of interest, advertising, recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure requirements. The Canadian funds for which Galileo acts as the investment fund manager are registered with the OSC pursuant to National Instrument 81-101/102/106. These National Policies impose additional obligations, including detailed operational requirements for both funds and their managers. The OSC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the rules ranging from fines and censures to termination of a portfolio manager and investment fund manager’s registration. The failure of Galileo, or the Canadian funds which Galileo advises, to comply with the requirements of the OSC could have a material adverse effect on Galileo.
 
U.S. Global and Galileo manage clients’ portfolios on a discretionary basis, with the authority to enter into security transactions, select broker-dealers to execute trades, and negotiate brokerage commissions. The Company may receive soft dollar credits from certain broker-dealers that are used to pay for research and related services or products, which therefore has the effect of reducing certain operating expenses. These soft dollar arrangements are intended to be within the safe harbor provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and National Instrument 23-102, as applicable. If the ability to use soft dollar arrangements were reduced or eliminated as a result of statutory amendments, new regulations or change in business practices, the Company’s operating expenses would increase.
 

Relationships with Clients
--------------------------

 
The businesses of the Company are to a very significant degree dependent on their associations and contractual relationships with USGIF. In the event the advisory or administrative agreements with USGIF are canceled or not renewed pursuant to the terms thereof, the Company would be substantially adversely affected. U.S. Global considers its relationships with the Funds to be good, and management has no reason to believe that the management and service contracts will not be renewed in the future; however, there is no assurance that USGIF will choose to continue its relationship with the Company.
 
In addition, the Company is also dependent on its relationships with its exchange traded fund clients. Even though the Company views its relationship with its exchange traded fund clients as stable, the Company could be adversely affected if that relationship ended.
 
Galileo is also dependent on its relationships with its clients. Even though Galileo views its relationship with its clients as stable, the Company could be adversely affected if these relationships ended.
