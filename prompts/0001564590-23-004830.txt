Summary 
 Catalyst Biosciences, Inc., together with its subsidiary (“Catalyst”), is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of Hydronidone for the treatment of NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) in the United States. Hydronidone is being evaluated for the treatment of liver fibrosis associated with a broad spectrum of chronic liver diseases. A Phase 1 clinical trial of Hydronidone has been completed in the United States and generated pharmacokinetic (“PK”), safety and tolerability data of single and multiple ascending doses of Hydronidone in U.S. healthy subjects.
Overview
 Prior to ceasing research and development activities in March 2022, Catalyst had engineered several protease assets that were designed to address unmet medical needs in disorders of the complement or coagulation systems. Prior to the F351 Agreement (as defined below), Catalyst had engaged in the research and development of product candidates from Catalyst’s protein engineering platform. In February 2022, Catalyst announced that it engaged Perella Weinberg Partners as a financial advisor to assist Catalyst in exploring strategic alternatives to monetize its assets. 
 In March 2022, Catalyst ceased research and development activities and in May 2022, Catalyst entered into an asset purchase agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Vertex”), pursuant to which Vertex purchased Catalyst’s complement portfolio, including CB 2782-PEG and CB 4332, as well as its complement-related intellectual property, including the ProTUNETM and ImmunoTUNETM platforms, for $60.0 million in cash consideration. $55.0 million was received upfront and the remaining $5.0 million was retained by Vertex as a hold-back until one year after the closing date to satisfy certain post-closing indemnification obligations. Any amounts received from Vertex with respect to this hold-back will be distributed to holders of the contingent value right issued to Catalyst stockholders of record on January 5, 2023.
 On September 20, 2022, the Company paid a special, one-time cash dividend payment of $1.43 per share, or approximately $45.0 million, to holders of our common stock.
 On December 26, 2022, Catalyst executed an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated December 26, 2022 (the “F351 Agreement”), with GNI Group Ltd. and GNI Hong Kong Limited (together “GNI”) to purchase all of the assets and intellectual property rights primarily related to GNI’s proprietary Hydronidone compound (collectively, the “F351 Assets”), other than such assets and intellectual property rights located in the People’s Republic of China. At the closing of the agreement on December 26, 2022, it paid GNI $35.0 million in the form of 6,266,521 shares of our common stock and 12,340 shares of a newly designated series of preferred stock (“Catalyst Convertible Preferred Stock”). Each share of Catalyst Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 10,000 shares of common stock, subject to stockholder approval under Nasdaq rules and subject to a beneficial ownership conversion blocker.
 On December 26, 2022, Catalyst, GNI USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“GNI USA”), GNI Japan, GNI Hong Kong, Shanghai Genomics, Inc., a company organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“SG” and collectively with GNI USA, GNI Japan and GNI Hong Kong, “Contributors,” and each a “Contributor”), the individuals (each, a “Minority Holder” and collectively, the “Minority Holders”) listed on an annex to that certain Business Combination Agreement, as amended (the “Business Combination Agreement”) and Continent Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Cayman Islands company limited by shares (“CPI”), entered into the Business Combination Agreement. The Business Combination Agreement contains the terms and conditions of the proposed business combination pursuant to which Catalyst will acquire an indirect controlling interest in Beijing Continent Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd, a company organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“BC”). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, (a) GNI USA will contribute all of its ordinary shares in the capital of CPI, par value $0.0001 per share (each a “CPI Ordinary Share”) to Catalyst in exchange for 688,850,101 shares of Catalyst common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Catalyst Common Stock”) (the “CPI Contribution”), (b) GNI USA will contribute its interest in Further Challenger International Limited, a company incorporated and existing under the laws of the British Virgin Islands with company number 1982271 (“Further Challenger”), to Catalyst in exchange for 264,971,695 shares of Catalyst Common Stock (the “FC Contribution”) and (c) each Minority Holder will contribute 100% of the interest he or she holds in his or her respective Entity (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) to Catalyst in exchange for an aggregate of 156,954,428 shares of Catalyst Common Stock in the amounts set forth 
 6


on an annex to the Business Combination Agreement (the “Minority Holder Contributions” and together with the CPI Contribution and the FC Contribution, the “Contributions”). At the election of GNI USA or any Minority Holder, GNI USA or such Minority Holder shall be issued shares of Catalyst Convertible Preferred Stock in lieu of some or all of the shares of Catalyst Common Stock GNI USA or such Minority Holder is entitled to receive.  Catalyst expects that the transactions under the Business Combination Agreement (the “Transactions”) will close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to obtaining necessary stockholder approvals.
 In accordance with the Business Combination Agreement, on December 26, 2022, Catalyst and the Rights Agent (as defined therein) executed a contingent value rights agreement (the “CVR Agreement”), pursuant to which each holder of our common stock as of January 5, 2023 (“CVR Holders”), received one contractual contingent value right (“CVR”) issued by us, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CVR Agreement, for each share of our common stock held by such holder. Each CVR entitles the holder thereof to receive (i) certain cash payments from the net proceeds related to the disposition of our legacy assets (MarzAA, DalcA, and CB 2679d-GT), (ii) 100% of the excess cash (net of all current or contingent liabilities, including transaction-related expenses) retained by us in excess of $1.0 million as of the closing date of the Business Combination Agreement, (iii) 100% of the amount actually received by us pursuant to the Vertex asset purchase agreement, and (iv) 100% of the excess, by which the preapproved costs to manage, negotiate, settle and finalize certain third party claims exceed the costs actually incurred with respect to such claims.  Catalyst anticipates one or more additional distributions to the holders of the CVRs in the future, although there can be no assurance as to the timing or amounts of any distributions it makes. The actual amount of any distributions will depend on many factors, including, without limitation, the timing of any distributable proceeds to Catalyst and the costs and expenses for activities related to those distributions. 
 On December 27, 2022, Catalyst declared another special cash dividend of $0.24 per share, or approximately $7.6 million, to holders of our common stock, excluding GNI, which was paid on January 12, 2023. 
 On February 27, 2023, Catalyst signed an asset purchase agreement with GC Biopharma Corp. (“GCBP”) pursuant to which GCBP acquired Catalyst’s legacy rare bleeding disorders programs including marzeptacog alpha activated (“MarzAA”), dalcinonacog alpha (“DalcA”) and CB-2679d-GT for a total of $6.0 million, $1.0 million payable on signing and $5.0 million payable on February 28, 2025, subject to satisfaction of post-closing indemnification obligations. In March 2023, Catalyst distributed net proceeds of approximately $0.2 million to the CVR Holders.  Once received, any additional net proceeds from the transaction will be distributed to the CVR Holders. 
 Catalyst is also pursuing certain legal claims against a third party related to payments under a 2016 asset purchase agreement, and any net recoveries related to these claims will be distributed to the CVR Holders.
 Current Product Development Plans
 Catalyst anticipates filing an IND application for the treatment of NASH in the United States in late 2023. NASH is a severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”), characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the liver that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, HCC and death. There are currently no approved products for the treatment of NASH.
 Hydronidone is a structural analogue of the approved anti-fibrotic (pulmonary fibrosis) drug pirfenidone. Hydronidone has been shown to inhibit in vitro both p38γ kinase activity and TGF-ß1-induced excessive collagen synthesis in hepatic stellate cells (“HSCs”),which are recognized as critical events in the development and progression of fibrosis in the liver. This is further supported by its anti-proliferative effects on the HSCs in the liver. In vitro anti-fibrotic effects of Hydronidone were also confirmed in several established in vivo rodent models of liver fibrosis such as carbon tetrachloride (“CCl4”)-induced liver fibrosis mouse model, DMN-induced liver fibrosis rat model, and HSA-induced liver fibrosis rat model, as well as mouse model of NASH fibrosis (CCl4 +Western [High Fat] Diet).  In the NASH mouse model, Hydronidone significantly reduced the severity of liver fibrosis, as well as demonstrating improvement in functional, biochemical and histopathological attributes of the affected liver tissue, including significant reduction of hydroxyproline content and liver enzymes (ALT), aspartate (AST), decrease in liver fatty degeneration, and levels of a spectrum of inflammatory cytokines, at doses 3-10 mg/kg/day, as well as decrease in NAS score and the CCl4 and western diet (“WD”)-induced fibrosis and cell ballooning in NASH model at doses of 15-50 mg/kg bid (HEDs of 144 – 480 mg) which are relevant to human exposure. Thus, the key attributes of 
 7


Hydronidone’s molecular mechanisms of action in animal models of liver fibrosis, support its efficacy potential in liver fibrosis of various etiologies including those associated with NASH.
Catalyst plans to initiate clinical development of Hydronidone in NASH fibrosis in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, Phase 2a, PoC clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, and Pharmacodynamics (“PD”) of Hydronidone capsules administered daily at an oral dose of 360 mg (given as 120 mg TID) for 24 weeks to adult subjects with advanced liver fibrosis associated with noncirrhotic NASH. The main goal of the proposed Phase 2a study is to obtain early PoC for Hydronidone in subjects with NASH fibrosis as a basis of expansion into a more comprehensive Phase 2/3 clinical program. The study will include a small sample size (total of 60 evaluable subjects) who will receive in a 2:1 ratio Hydronidone or Placebo. A single dose level that was shown to be safe and effective in a 52-week clinical study in Chinese subjects with advanced fibrosis associated with chronic Hepatitis B (“CHB”) infection will be used. The study will evaluate trends of changes from baseline in a set of noninvasive biochemical and imaging biomarkers relevant to assessment of NASH fibrosis in the context of drug exposure, as well as the mechanism of anti-fibrotic action of Hydronidone. The study will include PK blood sampling and assessment of the initial population PK and preliminary PK/PD relationship to inform Hydronidone treatment in future clinical studies in NASH fibrosis. In addition, this trial will include a disease-specific PROs, a validated composite CLDQ – NASH, to collect patient-reported data about the impact of Hydronidone treatment on quality of life of subjects with advanced NASH fibrosis.
 NASH represents a large and rapidly growing problem in the United States and worldwide. Diagnoses have been on the rise and are expected to increase dramatically in the next decade. The prevalence of NAFLD, which affects approximately 25% of the global population, and NASH, which develops in approximately 20% to 25% of NAFLD patients, is driven primarily by the worldwide obesity epidemic. As a result, the prevalence of NASH has increased significantly in recent decades, paralleling similar trends in the prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of these conditions is expected to increase further in view of the unhealthy nutrition habits, such as consumption of a diet high in fructose, sucrose and saturated fats, and sedentary behavior that characterize modern lifestyle.

The key attributes of Hydronidone’s molecular mechanisms of action in animal models of liver fibrosis included that of NASH, support its efficacy potential in liver fibrosis of various etiologies including that associated with NASH. Hydronidone has exhibited protective effects on CCl4+WD induced NASH; the total NAS and fibrosis scores were statistically significantly lower following Hydronidone dosing at 15-50 mg/kg/day. 
 In the NASH mouse model, Hydronidone significantly reduced the severity of fibrosis, as well as demonstrating improvement in functional, biochemical and histopathological attributes of the affected liver tissue, including significant reduction of hydroxyproline content and liver enzymes (ALT, AST), decrease in liver fatty degeneration, and levels of a spectrum of inflammatory cytokines, at doses 3-10 mg/kg/day, as well as decrease in NAS score and the CCl4 and WD-induced fibrosis and cell ballooning in NASH model at doses of 15-50 mg/kg bid (HEDs of 144 – 480 mg) which are relevant to human exposure. 
 In preclinical studies, the key attributes of Hydronidone’s molecular mechanisms of action in animal models of liver fibrosis included that of NASH, support its efficacy potential in liver fibrosis of various etiologies including that associated with NASH. To support the indication of NASH-associated fibrosis, GNI USA evaluated the anti-fibrotic effects of Hydronidone in a murine NASH model which is characterized by a rapid progression of extensive liver fibrosis. The model was induced by feeding male C57BL/6J mice (n=20/group) a high fat diet for 14 weeks. Subcutaneous injections of CCl4 in weeks 11-14 served as an accelerator of the liver pathology and exacerbated histological features of NASH and associated fibrosis. The establishment of the NASH model was indicated by statistically significantly higher body weights, lower food intake, and histopathologically observed fatty degeneration, inflammatory infiltrates, and hepatocellular ballooning in NASH mice vs negative control. The NAS total score, ballooning, and steatosis score in the NASH mice (positive control, model) group increased significantly compared to Naive (negative control group). Hydronidone exhibited protective effect on CCl4+WD induced NASH; the total NAS and fibrosis score were statistically significantly lower following Hydronidone dosing at 15-50 mg/kg/day. Fibrosis

and cell ballooning were significantly inhibited by Hydronidone, but no effects on inflammation and steatosis were observed. Hydronidone performed better than Pirfenidone in this model, at comparable dose. 
 On February 27, 2023, the Company signed an asset purchase agreement with GC Biopharma (“GCBP”) pursuant to which GCBP acquired the Company’s legacy rare bleeding disorders programs including MarzAA, DalcA and CB-2679d-GT for a total of $6 million, $1 million payable on signing and $5 million payable on February 28, 2025, subject to satisfaction of post-closing indemnification obligations. In March 2023, Catalyst distributed net proceeds of approximately $206,000 to the CVR Holders.  Once received, any additional net proceeds from the transaction will be distributed to the CVR Holders. Catalyst is also pursuing certain legal claims against a third party related to payments under a 2016 asset purchase agreement, and any net recoveries related to these claims will be distributed to the CVR Holders.
 Catalyst is located in South San Francisco, California and operates in one segment.
 Disease Overview - NASH
 NASH, a severe form of NAFLD, is characterized histologically by the additional presence of inflammation and hepatocellular injury, such as visible ballooning, and has a significantly worse prognosis, with the potential to progress to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis or HCC.
 NASH represents a large and rapidly growing problem in the United States and worldwide. Diagnoses have been on the rise and are expected to increase dramatically in the next decade. The prevalence of NAFLD, which affects approximately 25% of the global population, and NASH, which develops in approximately 20% to 25% of NAFLD patients, is driven primarily by the worldwide obesity epidemic. As a result, the prevalence of NASH has increased significantly in recent decades, paralleling similar trends in the prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of these conditions is expected to increase further due to unhealthy nutrition habits, such as consumption of a diet high in fructose, sucrose and saturated fats, and sedentary behavior.
 The critical pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the development and progression of NASH include reduced ability to metabolize and clear lipids, increased insulin resistance, injury to hepatocytes and liver fibrosis in response to hepatocyte injury. NASH patients have an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver resulting primarily from a caloric intake above and beyond energy needs. A healthy liver contains less than 5% fat, but a liver in someone with NASH can contain more than 20% fat. This abnormal liver fat contributes to the progression to NASH, a liver necro-inflammatory state, that can lead to scarring, also known as fibrosis, and, for some, can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure—cirrhosis develops in approximately 20% to 45% of patients. In some cases, cirrhosis progresses to decompensated cirrhosis, which results in permanent liver damage that can lead to liver failure. In addition, it is estimated that 8% of patients with advanced fibrosis will develop HCC. NASH is a complex, multifaceted disease that does not just affect the liver. Patients with NASH frequently have other significant metabolic co-morbidities such as obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and systemic hypertension (a constellation of which is commonly referred to as metabolic syndrome) and these further contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease.
 Etiology of NASH
 Understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to NASH has evolved in recent years. Excessive caloric overload, metabolic dysregulation, cardio-metabolic co-morbidities and genetic risk factors increase the likelihood of developing NASH, with a multitude of potential mechanistic contributors to pathophysiology. In NASH, the liver’s capacity to handle the primary metabolic energy substrates, carbohydrates and fatty acids, is overwhelmed. This occurs when there is an excess of free fatty acids deposited in the liver or their disposal from the liver is impaired. The accumulation of surplus free fatty acids leads to the formation of toxic lipid species. These toxic lipids then induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress and an inflammatory response, which can result in hepatocellular injury and death. This may lead to fibrosis and genomic instability, which may worsen over time to cirrhosis and HCC, respectively.
 The critical pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying development and progression of NASH include (1) reduced ability to handle lipids, (2) increased insulin resistance, (3) injury to hepatocytes and (4) development and progression of liver fibrosis in response to hepatocyte injury.

Diagnosis
 Most people with NASH are asymptomatic and their disease is often discovered incidentally following a liver imaging procedure, such as an ultrasound, prescribed for other reasons or as part of an investigation for elevated liver enzymes. Once suspected clinically, a liver biopsy is required to definitively diagnose NASH, which necessitates the joint presence of steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation. Once pathologically confirmed, the severity of NAFLD and NASH is determined using the histologically validated NAS, which grades disease activity on a scale of 0 to 8. The NAS is the sum of the individual scores for steatosis (0 to 3), lobular inflammation (0 to 3), and hepatocellular ballooning (0 to 2) but does not include a score for fibrosis. Fibrosis staging (F0-F4) relies on the Kleiner classification (F0 = no fibrosis; F1 = perisinusoidal or periportal fibrosis (not both); F2 = both perisinusoidal and periportal fibrosis; F3 = bridging fibrosis; F4 = cirrhosis).
 Histological diagnosis remains the gold standard for assessment of NASH and fibrosis. However, given that liver biopsy is associated with risks of pain, bleeding and other morbidity, as well as significant cost, the procedure is not practical for general patient screening. Additionally, histology diagnosis is confounded by evaluation of a small sliver of a large heterogenous organ that may not represent the full organ, and significant variability in reading of slides including inter- and intra-reader variability. Several non-invasive tools such as clinical risk scores, serum markers and imaging techniques are increasingly used to assess NASH patients. Non-invasive tests (“NITs”) such as the Fibroscan-AST score, Fibrosis-4 index, the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis score and vibration-controlled transient elastography, have been validated and are increasingly used. These NITs have an excellent negative predictive value and an acceptable positive predictive value for detection of advanced (≥ F3) fibrosis and are increasingly used in clinical settings. Additionally, evidence is emerging that shows a correlation between reduction in steatosis as measured by MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and reduction in ALT ≥17 U/L and histologic improvement on liver biopsy. In draft guidance, the FDA encouraged sponsors to identify biochemical or noninvasive imaging biomarkers that, once characterized and agreed by the FDA, could replace liver biopsies for patient selection and efficacy assessment in clinical trials.
 We expect that the validation and subsequent adoption of these NITs will result in an increase in the diagnosis and treatment rates for NASH in the future.
 Hydronidone Overview
 Hydronidone, Catalyst’s phase 1 clinical-stage drug, has the potential to treat NASH. To date, there are no approved products for the treatment of NASH. The phase 1 clinical trial results have demonstrated Hydronidone’s potential efficacy in the reversal of the fibrosis process. Hydronidone may reverse liver fibrosis by inhibiting hepatic stellate cell proliferation and the TGF-ß1 signaling pathway, both of which play major roles in the liver fibrosis associated with NASH. 
 Mechanism of Action
Hydronidone is a structural analogue of the approved drug pirfenidone. Hydronidone has been shown to inhibit both p38γ kinase activity and TGF-ß1-induced excessive collagen synthesis in vitro in HSCs, which are recognized as critical events in the development and progression of fibrosis in the liver. This is further supported by its anti-proliferative effects on the HSCs in the liver.
 In vitro anti-fibrotic effects of Hydronidone were also confirmed in several established in vivo models of liver fibrosis such as CCl4-induced liver fibrosis mouse model, DMN-induced liver fibrosis rat model, and HSA-induced liver fibrosis rat model, as well as mouse model of NASH fibrosis (CCl4 +Western [High Fat] Diet). 
 In the NASH mouse model, Hydronidone significantly reduced the severity of fibrosis, as well as demonstrating improvement in functional, biochemical and histopathological attributes of the affected liver tissue, including significant reduction of hydroxyproline content and liver enzymes (ALT, AST), decrease in liver fatty degeneration, and levels of a spectrum of inflammatory cytokines, at doses 3-10 mg/kg/day, as well as decrease in NAS score and the CCl4 and WD-induced fibrosis and cell ballooning in NASH model at doses of 15-50 mg/kg bid (HEDs of 144 – 480 mg) which are relevant to human exposure.

Thus, the key attributes of Hydronidone’s molecular mechanisms of action in animal models of liver fibrosis support its efficacy potential in liver fibrosis of various etiologies, including those associated with NASH.  
 The diagram below illustrates the mechanism of action of Hydronidone:

Biological Effects of Hydronidone
 Hydronidone is a new chemical entity, structural analogue of an approved anti-fibrotic drug, pirfenidone. The chemical structure and formula of Hydronidone are presented below.
 N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl-2-pyridone
 
C12H11NO2
 Hydronidone has been shown to inhibit both p38γ kinase activity and TGF-ß1-induced excessive collagen synthesis in HSCs, which are recognized as critical events in the development and progression of fibrosis in the liver. This is further supported by its anti-proliferative effects on the HSCs in the liver.

In vitro anti-fibrotic effects of Hydronidone were also confirmed in several established in vivo models of liver fibrosis such as CCl4-induced liver fibrosis mouse model, DMN-induced liver fibrosis rat model, and HSA-induced liver fibrosis rat model, as well as mouse model of NASH fibrosis (CCl4 +Western [High Fat] Diet). 
 In a NASH mouse model, Hydronidone significantly reduced the severity of fibrosis, as well as demonstrating improvement in functional, biochemical and histopathological attributes of the affected liver tissue, including significant reduction of hydroxyproline content and liver enzymes (ALT, AST), decrease in liver fatty degeneration, and levels of a spectrum of inflammatory cytokines, at doses 3-10 mg/kg/day, as well as decrease in NAS score and the CCl4 and WD-induced fibrosis and cell ballooning in NASH model at doses of 15-50 mg/kg bid (HEDs of 144 – 480 mg) which are relevant to human exposure.
 Hydronidone Pre-Clinical Development in NASH
Phase 1
 The primary objective of this study was to assess the PK of Hydronidone capsules when administered as single and repeated doses to healthy adult volunteers, and the secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Hydronidone capsules following single and multiple dose oral administrations to healthy adult volunteers. This was an open-label, two-part study. Part I was a single escalating dose, sequential cohort study of oral capsules of Hydronidone 30 mg and Hydronidone 120 mg. Part II was a multiple escalating dose, sequential cohort study of oral capsules of Hydronidone 30 mg TID for seven days and Hydronidone 120 mg TID for seven days. In Part II, subjects received an extra dose on the morning of Study Day 8. 
 Following single oral doses of Hydronidone 30 mg or 120 mg in Part I of the study, Hydronidone was rapidly absorbed showing a linear PK pattern of exposure, with mean elimination half-life of Hydronidone was 5 to 6 hours, and was 5 to 7 hours for M3 and M4 metabolites. Following repeated oral doses of Hydronidone 30 mg or 120 mg TID for seven days in Part II of the study, Hydronidone capsules were rapidly absorbed with similar PK pattern of exposure as seen following single doses of Hydronidone and similar half-life. Modest accumulation (less than 1.5-fold increase) was observed for Hydronidone, M3 and M4 with repeated 30 mg or 120 mg TID. Dose-normalized Hydronidone Cmax and AUC values were similar in males and females.
 Overall, Hydronidone was well tolerated when administered as a single oral dose of 30 mg or 120 mg and when administered as repeated oral doses of 30 mg or 120 mg TID for 7 days (22 total doses). There were no premature discontinuations due to adverse events (“AEs”), no serious adverse events (“SAEs”) nor deaths reported in this study. Treatment-emergent AEs reported following single dose administration in Part I of the study included a single AE of rhinorrhoea and scattered, isolated, reversible laboratory abnormalities. Treatment-emergent AEs reported following repeated dose administration in Part II of the study included headache (25.0%), constipation (16.7%) and somnolence (12.5%). Abdominal discomfort and flatulence were also reported as GI AEs in 1 subject each. Scattered, isolated, reversible or stable laboratory abnormalities were reported in 1 or 2 subjects. There were no clinically significant overall changes in safety laboratory tests that were attributable to study drug, including no evidence of any significant drug-induced liver injury, nor clinically significant overall changes in vital signs, ECG parameters or physical examinations that were attributable to study drug.
 Phase 2
 To support the IND filing and initiation of the proposed Phase 2a clinical study, Catalyst plans to cross-reference all clinical data obtained in studies currently completed under the IND, as well as those completed in the PRC. Specifically, the initiation of this clinical study is supported by the completed Phase 1 study bridging safety, tolerability, and PK in the United States in healthy subjects (single and multiple dosing), and the recently completed 52-week Phase 2 clinical study of Hydronidone in Chinese subjects with liver fibrosis associated with CHB infection conducted by BC. Catalyst believes that the results obtained in these studies provide adequate information on the current clinical risk/benefit profile of the drug and allow for safe initiation of the proposed Phase 2a clinical study of Hydronidone in NASH associated fibrosis. 
 Catalyst plans to initiate clinical development of Hydronidone in NASH fibrosis in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, Phase 2a, Proof-of-Concept (“PoC”) clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, and Pharmacodynamics (“PD”) of Hydronidone capsules administered daily at an oral dose of 360 
 12


mg (given as 120 mg TID) for 24 weeks to adult subjects with advanced liver fibrosis associated with noncirrhotic NASH. The main goal of the proposed Phase 2a study is to obtain early PoC for Hydronidone in subjects with NASH fibrosis as a basis of expansion into a more comprehensive Phase 2/3 clinical program. The study population will be further characterized by inclusion and exclusion criteria at baseline, which will include, among the others, serum biomarkers (i.e., NAFLD scoring) and imaging modality, such as LSM via FibroScan. Magnetic Resonance Elastography may be evaluated in a selected number of subjects as an exploratory measure. The cut-offs of both non-invasive biomarkers as well as elastography will be consistent with identifying patients with advanced fibrosis while separating them from those indicative of cirrhosis. 
 The proposed severity of fibrosis will allow more space for separation from placebo, if any. It has been shown that more severe fibrosis responds favorably to Hydronidone in the clinical trial of Hepatitis B-associated liver fibrosis, without significant safety concerns. In addition, these patients are at high risk for progression to cirrhosis without adequate treatment options, and as such, they are a suitable population for treatment with Hydronidone. 
 Agreements Relating to the Hydronidone Program
 F351 Asset Purchase Agreement
 On December 26, 2022, Catalyst acquired the F351 Assets from the GNI Japan and GNI Hong Kong. Pursuant to the F351 Agreement, Catalyst acquired all of the assets and intellectual property rights primarily related to GNI Japan’s and GNI Hong Kong’s proprietary Hydronidone compound, other than such assets and intellectual property rights located in the PRC. The F351 Assets include 15 issued or pending patents and patent applications outside of the PRC, with the last acquired issued patent expected to expire in August 2037.
 Under the terms of the F351 Agreement and upon the effective time of the transactions contemplated by the F351 Agreement, Catalyst paid GNI Japan and GNI Hong Kong $35,000,000 in the form of: 6,266,521 shares of Catalyst Common Stock; and 12,340 shares of Catalyst Convertible Preferred Stock.
 Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid innovation and significant technological advancements. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of Hydronidone and any future product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price, the level of generic competition and reimbursement. Our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases that we are targeting. Smaller or earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Given the high incidence of NASH, it is likely that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of liver and cardio-metabolic diseases, such as NASH, will increase.
 If Hydronidone is approved for the treatment of NASH, future competition could also arise from select products currently in development, including: Firsocostat/GS-0976, an ACC inhibitor, and Cilofexor/GS-9674, an FXR agonist, from Gilead Sciences, Inc.; Clesacostat/PF-05221304, an ACC inhibitor, and PF-06835919, a KHK inhibitor, from Pfizer Inc.; Ocaliva, an FXR agonist from Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Resmetirom, a beta-thyroid hormone receptor agonist from Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; VK2809, a beta-thyroid hormone receptor agonist from Viking Therapeutics, Inc.; Aldafermin, an FGF19 analog from NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.; MK-3655, an FGFR1c/KLB agonist antibody from Merck & Co., Inc.; Efruxifermin, a FGF21 fusion protein from Akero Therapeutics, Inc.; Pegozafermin, a FGF21 fusion protein from 89bio, Inc.; Belapectin, a Galectin-3 inhibitor from Galectin Therapeutics Inc.; Aramchol, a synthetic conjugate of cholic acid and arachidic acid from Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd.; Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist from Novo Nordisk A/S; Pemvidutide/ALT-801, a dual GLP-1/glucagon agonist from Altimmune; Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist from Eli Lilly and Company; Lanifibranor, a PPAR alpha/delta/gamma agonist from Inventiva; NNC0194-0499, an FGF21 analog from Novo Nordisk; BOS-580, an FGF21 analog from Boston Pharmaceuticals; and BFKB8488A, an FGFR1/KLB agonist antibody from Genentech; and pegozafermin, a specifically engineered glycoPEGylated analog of fibroblast growth factor 21 from 89bio, Inc.

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly longer operating histories and greater experience than we have in undertaking nonclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels for the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. As a result, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates. Our competitors may also develop and succeed in obtaining approval for drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies, then we may not be able to commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market. This would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling patients for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 Currently, the manufacturing of Hydronidone active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) and drug product supplies required for supporting the Phase 2a clinical study in NASH is being outsourced to WuXi STA, based in the PRC. The API and drug product will be of cGMP grade quality, and batch release and stability studies will comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Currently, the manufacturing and quality agreements for the Hydronidone API and drug product supplies to support the Phase 2a clinical study in NASH are under negotiation.
Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it through a variety of approaches, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, new targets, indications and applications and other inventions important to our business. For our product candidates, we generally pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of manufacture and methods of use. As we further develop our product candidates, we plan to identify additional novel candidates for patent protection that may potentially enhance commercial success, including pursuit of claims directed to new therapeutic indications.
Hydronidone Patents
 Our Hydronidone patent portfolio currently consists of five (5) patent families, including patents and/or patent applications in the United States, the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the European Patent Convention and Japan.
 The first patent family is entitled “DERIVATIVES OF PYRIDONE AND THE USE OF THEM”. The patent family provides granted patent protection in six countries, including the United States (U.S. Patent Number 7,824,133, expiry date: September 22, 2024; U.S. Patent Numbers 8,022,087 and 8,084,465, expiry dates: November 14, 2023), Japan (JP Patent Number 4614884, expiry date: November 14, 2023), and Germany (DE Patent Number 60340364, expiry date: November 14, 2023). The granted claims protect our lead drug candidate Hydronidone and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, as well as methods for preparing or using Hydronidone to treat fibrosis.  
 The second patent family is entitled “USE OF PYRIDONE DERIVATIVES IN THE PREVENTION OR TREATMENT OF TISSUE OR ORGAN TOXICITY INDUCED BY CYTOTOXIC AGENTS AND RADIATION”.  The patent family provides granted patent protection in four countries, including the United States (U.S. Patent Number 8,765,726, expiry date: July 17, 2028), Japan (JP Patent Number 5213852, expiry date: September 25, 2026), and Germany (DE Patent Number 602006025897, expiry date: September 25, 2026). The granted claims relate to methods for using Hydronidone to treat certain cytotoxic- or radiation-induced injuries, such as pneumonitis.
 14


The third patent family is entitled “METHOD FOR PREPARING HYDRONIDONE”.  The patent family provides granted patent protection in Japan (JP Patent Number 6764998, expiry date: August 3, 2037) for a method of preparing Hydronidone.  
 The fourth patent family is entitled “METHOD FOR PREPARING HYDRONIDONE”. The patent family provides granted patent protection in Japan (JP Patent Number 6764999, expiry date: August 3, 2037) for a method of preparing Hydronidone.  
 The fifth patent family is entitled “PHARMACEUTICAL HYDRONIDONE FORMULATIONS FOR DISEASES”.  The patent family comprises a pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application (PCT/CN2021/088104, international filing date: April 19, 2021). The pending claims relate to methods for using Hydronidone to treat liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, advanced hepatitis B viral infection, or NASH fibrosis.  
 We expect to continue to file patent applications to cover methods of treating additional indications, as well as new forms, formulations, and methods of manufacturing Hydronidone.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, product approval, manufacture, quality control, manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, promotion, advertising, sales, distribution, marketing, and import and export of drugs and biologic products. Our current product candidates are expected to be regulated as drugs. The processes for obtaining regulatory approval in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities both pre- and post-commercialization, are a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our research and development activities and require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
 In the United States, the FDA and other government entities regulate drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in the United States at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, issuance of warning letters and other types of regulatory letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil monetary penalties, refusals of or debarment from government contracts, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement of profits, civil or criminal investigations by the FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, State Attorneys General, and/or other agencies, False Claims Act suits and/or other litigation, and/or criminal prosecutions.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States must typically undertake the following:
  
• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective without FDA objection before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice (“GCP”), regulations, to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product for each indication for which approval is sought;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------

 15



 
• | review of the NDA by an FDA advisory committee, where applicable;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product, and the active pharmaceutical ingredient or ingredients thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP, regulations and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees, as applicable, and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, such as any REMS, or post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies and an IND
 Preclinical studies can include in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and, in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. Other studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity, stability and physical form of the manufactured drug substance or API and the physical properties, stability and reproducibility of the formulated drug or drug product. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing, such as longer-term toxicity testing, animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may place a clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 16


Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
 Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites in late-stage clinical trials to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently $2.876 million for fiscal year 2021, for applications requiring clinical data, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently $336,432 for fiscal year 2021. These fees are adjusted annually.
 Under certain circumstances, the FDA will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business, defined as a company with less than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, submits for review. An affiliate is defined as a business entity that has a relationship with a second business entity if one business entity controls, or has the power to control, the other business entity, or a third-party controls, or has the power to control, both entities. In addition, an application to market a prescription drug product that has received orphan designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or for which there is no reasonable expectation that U.S. sales will be sufficient to recoup the development and production costs.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in 
 17


compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP.
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. After approval, the FDA may seek to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. Some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Fast Track Designation, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review, Orphan Drug Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Programs
 Fast Track
 There are several FDA programs intended to help facilitate the development of new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biological product may request the FDA to designate the drug or biological product as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Under a Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
Priority Review
 A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review to facilitate the review.
 18


Accelerated Approval
 A product that is being studied for safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that it may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, for seven years. These circumstances are an inability to supply the drug in sufficient quantities or a situation in which a new formulation of the drug has shown superior safety or efficacy or a major contribution to patient care. This exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of its product for seven years if a competitor obtains earlier approval of the same drug for the same indication.
Rare Pediatric Drug Designation
 There are FDA programs intended to help facilitate the development of new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for rare pediatric disease designation if they treat a serious or life-threatening condition that affects less than 200,000 individuals in the United States per year and who are primarily less than 18 years of age. Under the FDA’s rare pediatric disease designation program, the FDA may grant a priority review voucher to a sponsor who receives a product approval for a rare pediatric disease. 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 A product may also be eligible for receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy designation. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the FDA’s review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases where “preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.” The designation of a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy provides the same benefits as are available under the Fast Track program, as well as intensive FDA guidance on the product’s development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but they may expedite the development or approval process.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced 
 19


inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented.
 FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events or problems with manufacturing processes of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant criminal and civil liability.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, (“PDMA”), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval.
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20



A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Legislative Developments
 The 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), which was signed into law in December 2016, includes provisions to accelerate the development and delivery of new treatments. For example, the Cures Act requires the FDA to establish a program to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help to support the approval of a new indication for an approved drug and to help to support or satisfy post-approval study requirements, to issue guidance on adaptive and novel clinical trial designs for new drugs, and to establish a process for qualifying drug development tools used to support FDA approval for marketing or investigational use of a drug. The Cures Act also permits the FDA to rely on qualified data summaries to support the approval of a supplemental application for an already approved drug. The FDA is in the process of implementing the Cures Act requirements.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, its activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA and similar state laws, each as amended.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. There are statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that 
 21


may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Catalyst’s practices may not in all cases meet all the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved and thus non-reimbursable, uses. HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 Catalyst may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which Catalyst conducts its business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.

To distribute products commercially, Catalyst must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All its activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 If its operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to Catalyst, Catalyst may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow Catalyst to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, any of which could adversely affect its ability to operate its business and its results of operations.
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which Catalyst obtains regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which Catalyst receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, privately managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Catalyst may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Its product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. This is also true of Medicare reimbursement, where different vendors process payments, so that coverage by one vendor does not assure that all other vendors will provide coverage. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable Catalyst to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development. In addition, the United States federal government position on matters related to drug pricing is evolving and uncertain and any changes could have a material impact on drug pricing generally in the United States, including for its product candidates if approved.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom also requires consideration of cost-benefit analysis. The downward pressure on healthcare costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being 
 23


erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which Catalyst receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and Catalyst expects will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which Catalyst receives regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect its business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in and wastes generated by, its operations. If its operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, Catalyst could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Catalyst believes that it is in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Catalyst cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect its future operations.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, Catalyst will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of its products. Whether or not Catalyst obtains FDA approval of a product, Catalyst must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, Catalyst must submit a marketing authorization application. 
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

If Catalyst or its potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, Catalyst may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
