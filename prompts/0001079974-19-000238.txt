ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Legacy Ventures International, Inc. (“Legacy” or the “Company”), was incorporated on March 4, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Since September 15, 2015, the Company operated through a wholly-owned subsidiary RM Fresh Brands Inc. (“RM Fresh”), who services food and beverage retailers and distributors who are looking for innovative, trend-setting products across North America and in international markets. With a focus on sustainable, category changing consumables, RM Fresh acquired the rights to distribute an extensive portfolio of highly desirable brands, including Boxed Water, Cleansify, Uncle Si’s Iced Tea, Chef 5-Minute Meals, Gurkha Cigars, Shimla Foods, Aloe Gloe and Arriba Horchata. Through a network of sub-distribution partners across Canada, RM Fresh provides national product distribution and brokerage services. RM Fresh has an emerging focus on the United States and Middle East through the establishment of sub-distribution partners.
 
On August 31, 2016, in order to fund the ongoing operation and further development of RM, the Company consented to new third party investments into RM in the approximate total amount of $175,000, made in the form of cash and retirement of indebtedness owed by RM. As result of these new investments into RM, the Company’s ownership percentage of the company was reduced to twenty percent (20%). In addition, the Company entered into a new Shareholder Agreement with RM, under which the shares in RM owned by the Company are subject to certain restrictions on transfer until such time as we declare a shareholder dividend of our RM shares following a going public transaction by RM, or in the alternative, for one (1) year after RM completes a going public transaction. Further, the Company disposed of an inter-company liability owed to the Company by RM in the amount of CDN$166,961.70. The liability was documented under a Demand Promissory Note issued to us by RM. The Company then assigned the note to an investor in RM in exchange for $3,000. Finally, the Company entered into a mutual Release agreement with RM. Under the Release, the Company released and discharged all liabilities owed to the Company by RM (with the exception of the Demand Promissory Note). RM in turn released the Company of all liabilities owing to RM and released the Company all ongoing contractual and financial responsibilities to RM, including our contractual obligation to further fund management fees or other expenses to be incurred by RM. The carrying value of the investment in RM Fresh was previously written down to $nil.


On June 28, 2017, Randall Letcavage entered into a stock purchase agreement for the acquisition of an aggregate of 286,720 shares of Common Stock of the Company, representing approximately 91% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company as of such date, from Rehan Saeed, the previous majority shareholder of the Company (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase Agreements were fully executed and delivered, and the transaction consummated as of and at July 7, 2017. Consequently, Mr. Letcavage was able to unilaterally control the election of our Board of Directors, all matters upon which shareholder approval is required and, ultimately, the direction of the Company.


In addition, on June 28, 2017, Rehan Saeed submitted his resignation from all executive officer positions with the Company, including Chief Executive Officer and President, effective on the 10th day following the filing of a Schedule 14f-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

However, Mr. Milonas claims that he did not fully execute and deliver the Agreement and has disclaimed ownership of the subject shares. Mr. Letcavage will not contest Mr. Milonas’ claims and as a result, Mr. Letcavage’s ownership of the shares did not change as disclosed.
 
On August 9, 2018, Mr. Letcavage, as the holder of 91% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, approved the appointment of Peter Sohn as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Director of the Company. Effective December 17, 2018, and Mr. Sohn accepted the appointments as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Director of the Company.

Notwithstanding the disclosure made in the 09/15/17 Form 8K and the11/29/17 Amended Form 8K, the consummation of the acquisition of Nexalin was subject to a number of contractual conditions and legal requirements. These included:
 

(i) | all representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Share Exchange Agreement were to be true in all material respects;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the Company was to have performed and complied in all material respects with all covenants and agreements required by the Share Purchase Agreement;
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | the Company was to obtain all material consents, approvals and authorizations required to be obtained and make all filings required to be made by the Company for the authorization and consummation of the Share Purchase Agreement;
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | Nexalin and the Nexalin Shareholders were to be given the opportunity to initiate and complete their legal, accounting and business due diligence of the Company and the results were to be satisfactory to Nexalin and the Nexalin Shareholders in their sole and absolute discretion;
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(v) | the Units, which included the Company’s Common Stock and Warrants, were to be delivered to the Nexalin Shareholders within five (5) business days following the Closing of the Share Exchange Agreement. The Company was also required to take any and all action required under the various state securities laws in connection with the issuance of the Units.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Once new management and a new Board of Directors were in place, they conducted a review of the Company and the steps taken and to be taken to consummate the acquisition of Nexalin. After the due diligence review was performed, including legal, accounting and business investigations of the Company, the new management and new Board of Directors became aware of a series of issues that put into question whether there had been or could be completion of the acquisition transaction and that put into issue whether past actions by the Company complied with applicable legal requirements and better business practice. After performing this due diligence review, the new Board of Directors determined that many of the requirements of and pre-conditions to the Share Exchange Agreement were not completed and the condition of the Company was not satisfactory to accomplish the objectives of the Share Exchange Agreement.
 
After careful consideration, the current management and Board of Directors believe that the previously announced share exchange, in fact, had not closed, and because of the many issues identified in its due diligence review, some of which cannot ever be satisfied or adequately remedied, it considers that the Share Exchange Agreement is null and void ab initio.
 
It is the opinion of current management and the current Board of Directors, based on the nullity of the Share Exchange Agreement, that Nexalin never was and is not now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
