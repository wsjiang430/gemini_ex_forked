Introduction
 
Progressive Care Inc. (“Progressive”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on October 31, 2006 under the name Progressive Training, Inc. We changed our name to Progressive Care Inc. in connection with a merger with Progressive Care Inc. on November 23, 2010. Progressive, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Pharmco, LLC doing business as Pharmcorx (“Pharmco 901”) and Pharmcorx LTC, Touchpoint RX, LLC doing business as PharmcoRx 1002, LLC (“Pharmco 1002”), Family Physicians RX, Inc. doing business as PharmcoRx 1103 and PharmcoRx 1204 (“FPRX” historically or “Pharmco 1103” and “Pharmco 1204”) (pharmacy subsidiaries collectively referred to as “Pharmco”), and ClearMetrX Inc (“ClearMetrX”) is a personalized healthcare services and technology company that provides prescription pharmaceuticals and risk and data management services to healthcare organizations and providers. Pharmco provides prescription pharmaceuticals, compounded medications, tele-pharmacy services, anti-retroviral medications, medication therapy management, the supply of prescription medications to long-term care facilities, contracted pharmacy services for 340B covered entities under the 340B Drug Discount Pricing Program, and health practice risk management. Pharmco also offers certain disease testing and vaccinations.
 
We offer services in a variety of languages, including English, Spanish, French, Creole, Portuguese, Ukrainian and Russian.
 
Our services are designed to provide satisfaction across all medication stakeholders and enhance loyalty and key performance metrics. We offer value-added services at no additional charge including prior authorization assistance, same-day home-medication delivery, on site provider consultation services, primary care reporting and analytics, and customized packaging solutions. The pharmacies accept most major insurance plans and provide access to co-pay assistance programs to income qualified patients, discount and manufacturer coupons, and competitive cash payment options.
 
Products and Services
 
We enhance patient adherence to complex drug regimens, collect and report data, and ensure effective dispensing of medications to support the needs of patients, providers, and payors. Our patient and provider support services ensure appropriate drug initiation, facilitate patient compliance and adherence, and capture important information regarding safety and effectiveness of the medications that we dispense.
 
Pharmco is rated by pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”) based on its ability to adequately supply chronic care medications to patients during a measurement period. This score is then compared to the scores of other pharmacies in the network at which point a relative rating is issued. For the year ended December 31, 2022, per EQuIPP®, a performance information management tool that provides standardized, benchmarked data to help shape strategies and guide medication-related performance improvement, our performance score was Five Stars, ranking our pharmacy among the top pharmacies in the U.S. Primary care physicians may refer patients to pharmacies that have high performance scores, though patients retain the right to have their prescriptions dispensed by a network of pharmacies of their choice.
 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary, ClearMetrX, we offer data management and reporting services to support health care organizations. There are substantial restrictions in federal and state laws on the use and sharing of patient data and ClearMetrX is in compliance with such laws. The ClearMetrX offerings include data management and Third-Party Administration (“TPA”) services for 340B covered entities, pharmacy data analytics, and programs to manage HEDIS Quality Measures including Medication Adherence. These offerings cater to the glaring need for frontline providers to understand best practices, patient behaviors, care management processes, and the financial mechanisms behind these decisions. We provide data access and actionable insights that providers and support organizations can use to improve their practice and patient care.
 
Pharmco also provides contracted pharmacy services for 340B covered entities under the 340B Drug Discount Pricing Program. Under the terms of these agreements, we act as a pass through for third-party payor reimbursements on prescription claims adjudicated on behalf of each 340B covered entity and receive a dispensing fee per prescription. These dispensing fees vary by the 340B covered entity and the level of service provided by us.
 
For our long-term care (“LTC”) customers, Pharmco provides purchasing, repackaging and dispensing of both prescription and non-prescription pharmaceutical products. Pharmco utilizes a unit-of-dose packaging system as opposed to the traditional vials as this method of distribution is the industry best practice standard. Pharmco is equipped for various types of unit-of-dose packaging options to meet the needs of LTC patients and retail customers. Pharmco uses the same robotic packaging systems currently used by chain, mail order, and large-scale pharmacies. Pharmco also provides computerized maintenance of patient prescription histories, third-party billing and consultant pharmacist services. Pharmco’s consultant pharmacist services consist primarily of evaluation of monthly patient drug therapy and monitoring the LTC institution’s drug distribution system.
 
Medication therapy management (“MTM”) involves review and adjustment of prescribed drug therapies to improve patient health outcomes for patients with multiple prescriptions. This process includes several activities such as performing patient assessments, creating medication treatment plans, monitoring the effectiveness of and adherence to prescribed therapies, and delivering documentation of these services to the patient’s physician to coordinate comprehensive care.
 
Distribution Methods
 
We currently deliver prescriptions throughout Florida and ship medications to residents in those states where we hold non-resident pharmacy licenses. We currently hold Florida Community Pharmacy Permits at all Florida pharmacy locations and our Pharmco 901 location is licensed as a non-resident pharmacy in the following states: Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Utah. We can dispense to patients in the state of Massachusetts without a non-resident pharmacy license because Massachusetts does not require such a license for these activities.

Industry Overview and Market Opportunities
 
Pharmacy operations
 
The retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries are highly competitive and dynamic and have experienced consolidation and an evolving competitive landscape in recent years. Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare, constituting a first line of treatment for many medical conditions. New and innovative drugs will improve quality of life and control healthcare costs. In light of accelerating usage of mail order and delivery-based services, both before and after the global COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the market for personalized and convenient care access is increasing. We have provided same-day and next-day home delivery services since the beginning of our operations. We are well positioned in Florida to gain additional market share among a broad demographic of patients due to our high-performance scores and value-added services. Additionally, we value opportunities that create strategic partnerships, acquire synergistic operations and expand current operations to round out pharmacy capabilities which could potentially include, but are not limited to, specialty medications, sterile compounding, and mail-order.
 
Data management services
 
The latest trend in healthcare is to use data to improve patient outcomes and quality of life – a practice known as “Applied Health Analytics”. “Data analytics” refers to the practice of aggregating large data sets and analyzing them to draw important insights and recommendations. This process is increasingly aided by new software and technology that facilitates the examination of large volumes of data to detect hidden information.
 
A key objective within organizations with access to large data collections is to harness the most relevant data and use it to optimize decision making. ClearMetrX developed the 340MetrX platform that retrieves dispensing pharmacy data to provide physicians and 340B covered entities with valuable and insightful reports and analytics to manage their operations.
 
We also serve the following key constituents, to benefit our patients:
 
Physicians and Health Systems: Our team works with physician offices to manage prior-authorization and other requirements of managed care organization requirements, such as denial and appeal process, to ensure that complicated administrative tasks do not impair the delivery of quality patient care. We provide risk evaluation services, implement risk mitigation strategies, and collect patient adherence data to provide physicians and health systems with enhanced visibility. Our tools and processes improve physician performance metrics which in turn results in enhanced profitability of the physicians’ practices.
 
Payors: We manage prescription regimens for chronically ill populations and help payors, including health insurance plans and PBMs, reduce costs through patient care management, reduction in readmission rates, decreased acute care spending for chronic care conditions, formulary compliance, and implementation of lowest cost-effective alternative therapies.
 
Virtual healthcare services and healthcare technologies
 
Virtual healthcare services, or Telehealth, is a growing segment of the healthcare sector. It involves remotely exchanging patient data between locations for the purposes of obtaining assistance in monitoring and diagnosing. Telehealth allows the healthcare practitioner to easily offer their services on consultation, care management, diagnosis, and self-management services using information and communication technologies. These services are being offered through various modes of delivery, such as on-premises, web-based, and cloud-based delivery. A growing population over the age of 65, the increase in the number of chronic diseases, and a rise in demand for home monitoring devices are the major drivers which are likely to aid the growth of the telehealth market.
 
In the current environment, healthcare information is increasingly fragmented with numerous electronic healthcare record platforms, virtual care systems, pharmacy software, and data silos and transmitters which lack fundamental integration. Healthcare stakeholders are often at odds about proper care techniques and this lack of alignment increases burdens on providers and patients alike and is associated with decreasing satisfaction with healthcare services and negative health outcomes.

Growth Strategy
 
We plan to grow our business by continuing to execute on the following key growth strategies:
 
Data Management Services. We believe that data management for frontline and independent providers, 340B covered entities, and pharmacies will have increasing importance as health systems evolve to become virtual and digitized. Increasing focus on performance, margins, and quality, means that our models and platforms will have strategic value through our roots in day-to-day care management. Data management services will become an increasing driver of growth and development for us with its higher margins and diverse monetization pathways.
 
Invest in Sales and Marketing. We are based in South Florida and will continue to grow our dispensing operations throughout the state, and there are opportunities to expand geographically throughout the rest of the country. Our data management services and health IT services can be used by customers across the U.S. and we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing efforts for these services.
 
Selectively Pursue Growth Through Strategic Acquisitions. We believe the specialty pharmacy industry is highly fragmented and provides numerous opportunities to expand through acquisitions. While we will continue to focus on growing our business organically, we believe we can opportunistically enhance our competitive position through complementary acquisitions in both existing and new markets. We plan to selectively evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in other therapeutic categories, services, and technologies with the goal of preserving our culture, optimizing patient outcomes, enhancing value to other constituents, and building long-term value for our shareholders.
 
Competitive Business Conditions, Competitive Positions and Methods of Competition
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we are well positioned to continue to increase our market share based on the following competitive strengths:
 
Adding value to all constituents. The value we deliver to all constituents is based upon our thousands of daily patient interactions. We help patients adhere to complicated medication therapies, process refills, manage any side effects, and manage any insurance concerns ensuring that they get the best standard of care. The clinical efficacy of drug therapies, especially for acute and chronic conditions, is typically enhanced when patients precisely follow the prescribed treatment regimens, including dosing and frequency.

Performance. Pharmacies are measured against their peers to improve quality of patient care. We have dedicated staff to track performance metrics, ensuring high comparative adherence rates. Across the population, an average 50% of patients are adherent to prescribed medication protocols. We believe our high adherence rates are due to, among other things, our model of proactive patient engagement, direct communication with and connections to healthcare stakeholders, our patient training and education, patient behavior analysis and medication coaching, compliance packaging, tracking timing of refills, free home delivery, and language support. We also help identify third-party funding support programs to help cover expensive out-of-pocket costs.
 
Clinically trained operational professionals. Our licensed pharmacists and technicians have been trained on our patient care model and data management tools to conduct a full healthcare evaluation. These healthcare professionals not only dispense medications, but also analyze patients’ needs, behaviors, lifestyles, healthcare services providers, and payor resources to optimize the medication therapies received. Our staff conducts this full healthcare evaluation while also communicating necessary care information to authorized providers and caregivers before medications are dispensed, which differentiates our pharmacy operations from our competitors’ models.
 
Lean and nimble operational strategy. Healthcare is an industry where best practices are continuously evolving. With increasing emphasis on reducing healthcare costs which puts pressure on gross margins, we have identified new trends and opportunities pivoting to business processes better suited to future environments. Additionally, we have focused on diversifying our revenue streams within the pharmacy industry to identify complementary and associated revenue opportunities to keep the operation one step ahead of market forces.
 
Diversity and cultural awareness. We represent the fabric of the community from which we originate. Our employees consist of diverse faiths, races, ethnic origins, and sexual orientations. This provides us with the unique ability to speak the language that our patients and providers speak. It has also allowed us to be innovative in our approach to healthcare by leveraging the broad perspectives of our team to challenge our methodologies and be responsive to the unique needs of our patients, clients, and customers.
 
Competitive Positions and Methods of Competition
 
We compete with national and independent retail drug stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, mail order prescription providers, discount merchandisers, membership clubs, health clinics, provider dispensaries, and internet pharmacies. Competition is based on several factors including store location and convenience, customer service and satisfaction, product selection and variety, and price. Our primary competitive advantages lie in providing personalized service to the patients and facility operators, selectively adding labor saving and compliance enhancing processes and carrying inventory to provide rapid delivery of all pharmaceutical needs, free home delivery services, and data management and analytics.
 
In the United States, the provision of healthcare services of any kind is highly competitive. Our ability to recruit qualified personnel, attract new institutional and retail clients, and expand the reach of our pharmacy operations relies on our ability to quickly adapt to changing societal attitudes, market pressure, and government regulation.

We face substantial competition within the pharmaceutical healthcare services industry and in the past year have seen even more consolidation. We expect to see this trend continue in the coming year and it is uncertain what effect, if any, these consolidations will have on us or the industry. The industry includes several large, well-capitalized companies with nationwide operations and capabilities in the specialty services and PBM services arenas, such as CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, Humana, Walgreens, Optum, MedImpact Healthcare Systems and many smaller organizations that typically operate on a local or regional basis. In the Specialty Pharmacy Services segment, we compete with several national and regional specialty pharmacy companies that have substantial financial resources and which also provide products and services to the chronically ill, such as CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, Humana, Optum and Walgreens.
 
Some of our pharmacy service competitors are under common control with, or are owned by, pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors or retail pharmacy chains and may be better positioned with respect to the cost-effective distribution of pharmaceuticals. Some of our primary competitors, such as Omnicare and Walgreens, have a substantially larger market share than our existing market share. Moreover, some of our competitors may have secured long-term supply or distribution arrangements for prescription pharmaceuticals necessary to treat certain chronic disease states on price terms substantially more favorable than the terms currently available to us. Because of such advantageous pricing, we may be less price competitive than some of these competitors with respect to certain pharmaceutical products.
 
Suppliers
 
We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from wholesale drug distributors. We have maintained a relationship with a primary supplier that accounted for 95% and 96% of pharmaceutical purchases for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and several supplementary suppliers. Our primary supplier for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was McKesson. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of drug supply are unavailable. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers, overall, are good, and that there are alternative suppliers in the marketplace.
Dependence On One or a Few Major Customers
 
We sell to numerous customers including various managed care organizations within both the private and public sectors. Certain healthcare payors account for up to 56% and 59% of our consolidated net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Medicare Part D and the State of Florida Medicaid public assistance program are major sources of revenue. However, both government programs are privatized and are managed under several different healthcare payors, the concentration of which varies throughout the course of the year. Many of these healthcare payors have contracted agreements with our pharmacies for annual terms that have options to automatically renew annually. We depend on these healthcare payors and a loss of one or more would have a major impact on the business. The Company or the healthcare payor may terminate the network participation agreement at any time by way of advance notice to the other party.
Patents and Trademarks
 
We currently have no registered patents or trademarks that we either own or lease.
 
Governmental Approval
 
Government approval is necessary to open any new pharmacy or other health services location.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations
 
As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and relationships are subject to federal and state laws and regulations and enforcement by federal and state governmental agencies. Various federal and state laws and regulations govern the purchase, dispensing or distribution, and management of prescription drugs and related services we provide and may affect us. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all legal requirements material to our operations.
 
We conduct ongoing educational programs to inform employees regarding compliance with relevant laws and regulations and maintain a formal reporting procedure to disclose possible violations of these laws and regulations to the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Professional Licensure. Pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and certain other health care professionals employed by us are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state law. We perform searches in criminal, federal and state exclusion lists, and other background checks on employees and are required under state licensure to ensure that our employees possess all necessary licenses and certifications. We believe that our employees comply in all material respects with applicable licensure laws.
 
State laws require that each pharmacy location be licensed as an in-state or non-resident pharmacy to dispense pharmaceuticals in that state. State controlled substance laws require registration and compliance with state pharmacy licensure, registration or permit standards promulgated by the state’s pharmacy licensing authority. Such standards often address the qualification of an applicant’s personnel, the adequacy of its prescription fulfillment and inventory control practices and the adequacy of its facilities. In general, pharmacy licenses are renewed annually or biennial according to state laws. We believe that our pharmacies’ present and future locations comply with all state licensing laws applicable to these businesses. If our pharmacy locations become subject to additional licensure requirements, are unable to maintain their required licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on pharmacies, our ability to operate in the state would be limited, which could have an adverse impact on our business.
 
Other Laws Affecting Pharmacy Operations. We are subject to federal and state statutes and regulations governing the operation of pharmacies, repackaging of drug products, wholesale distribution, dispensing of controlled substances, medical waste disposal, and clinical trials. Federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances. Federal and state-controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) and to comply with security, record keeping, inventory control, labeling standards and other requirements to dispense controlled substances.
 
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Certain provisions of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act govern the handling and distribution of pharmaceutical products. This law exempts many pharmaceuticals and medical devices from federal labeling and packaging requirements if they are not adulterated or misbranded and are dispensed in accordance with, and pursuant to, a valid prescription. We believe that we comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements.
 
Anti-Kickback Laws. Subject to certain statutory and regulatory exceptions (including exceptions relating to certain managed care, discount, bona fide employment arrangements, group purchasing and personal services arrangements), the federal “anti-kickback” law prohibits the knowing and willful offer or payment of any remuneration to induce the referral of an individual or the purchase, lease or order (or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase, lease or order) of healthcare items or services paid for in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs (including both traditional Medicaid fee-for-service programs as well as Medicaid managed care programs). Violation of the federal anti-kickback statute could subject us to criminal and/or civil penalties including suspension or exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs and other government-funded healthcare programs for not less than five years, or the imposition of civil monetary penalties. Exclusion from any of these programs or sanctions of civil monetary penalties could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.
 
The federal anti-kickback law has been interpreted broadly by courts, the OIG of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), and other administrative bodies. Because of the broad scope of those statutes, federal regulations establish certain safe harbors from liability. Safe harbors exist for certain properly reported discounts received from vendors, certain investment interests held by a person or entity, and certain properly disclosed payments made by vendors to group purchasing organizations, as well as for other transactions or relationships. Nonetheless, a practice that does not fall within a safe harbor is not necessarily unlawful but may be subject to scrutiny and challenge. In the absence of an applicable exception or safe harbor, a violation of the statute may occur even if only one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce patient referrals or purchases. Among the practices that have been identified by the OIG as potentially improper under the statute are certain “product conversion” or “switching” programs in which benefits are given by drug manufacturers to pharmacists or physicians for changing a prescription (or recommending or requesting such a change) from one drug to another. Anti-kickback laws have been cited as a partial basis, along with state consumer protection laws discussed below, for investigations and multi-state settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies about such programs.

Several states also have enacted anti-kickback laws that sometimes apply not only to state-sponsored healthcare programs but also to items or services that are paid for by private insurance and self-pay patients. State anti-kickback laws can vary considerably in their applicability and scope and sometimes have fewer statutory and regulatory exceptions than federal law. Management understands the importance of anti-kickback laws and has helped structure our operations in a manner believed to be compliant with these laws.
 
The Stark Laws. The federal self-referral law, commonly known as the “Stark Law”, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” (which include, among other things, outpatient prescription drugs, durable medical equipment and supplies and home health services) to an entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a direct or indirect financial relationship, unless the financial relationship is structured to meet an applicable exception. Several states have enacted laws similar to the Stark Law. These state laws may cover all, not just Medicare and Medicaid, patients and exceptions or safe harbors may vary from the Stark Law and vary significantly from state to state. Many federal healthcare reform proposals in the past few years have attempted to expand the Stark Law to cover all patients as well. Possible penalties for violation of the Stark Law include denial of payment, refund of amounts collected in violation of the statute, civil monetary penalties, and program exclusion. Noncompliance with the Stark Law could adversely affect our financial results and operations.
 
Statutes Prohibiting False Claims and Fraudulent Billing Activities. A range of federal civil and criminal laws target false claims and fraudulent billing activities. One of the most significant is the federal False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”), which imposes civil penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made false claims to secure a reimbursement from government-sponsored programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Investigations or actions commenced under the False Claims Act may be brought either by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government, through a “whistleblower” or “qui tam” action. The False Claims Act authorizes the payment of a portion of any recovery to the individual suing. Such actions are initially required to be filed under seal pending their review by the Department of Justice. If the government intervenes in the lawsuit and prevails, the whistleblower (or plaintiff filing the initial complaint) may share with the federal government in any settlement or judgment. If the government does not intervene in the lawsuit, the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently. The False Claims Act generally provides for the imposition of civil penalties and for treble damages, resulting in the possibility of substantial financial penalties for small billing errors that are replicated in many claims, as each individual claim could be deemed to be a separate violation of the False Claims Act.
 
Some states also have enacted statutes like the False Claims Act which may include criminal penalties, substantial fines, and treble damages. In recent years, federal and state governments have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws. Under Section 1909 of the Social Security Act, if a state false claim act meets certain requirements as determined by the OIG in consultation with the U.S. Attorney General, the state is entitled to an increase of ten percentage points in the state medical assistance percentage with respect to any amounts recovered under a state action brought under such a law. Some of the larger states in terms of population that have had the OIG review such laws include California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Tennessee and Texas. We operate in several of these states and submit claims for Medicaid reimbursement to the respective state Medicaid agency. This legislation has led to increased auditing activities by state healthcare regulators. As such, we have been the subject of an increased number of audits. While we believe that we are following Medicaid and Medicare billing rules and requirements, there can be no assurance that regulators would agree with the methodology employed by us in billing for our products and services and a material disagreement between us and these governmental agencies on the way we provide products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, our financial position, and our results of operations.

The False Claims Act also has been used by the federal government and private whistleblowers to bring enforcement actions under so-called “fraud and abuse” laws like the federal anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law. Such actions are not based on a contention that an entity has submitted claims that are facially invalid. Instead, such actions are based on the theory that when an entity submits a claim, it either expressly or impliedly certifies that it has provided the underlying services in compliance with applicable laws, and therefore that services provided and billed for during an anti-kickback statute or Stark Law violation result in false claims, even if such claims are billed accurately for appropriate and medically necessary services. The availability of the False Claims Act to enforce alleged fraud and abuse violations has increased the potential for such actions to be brought, and which often are costly and time-consuming to defend.
 
Confidentiality and Privacy. Most of our activities involve the receipt, use and disclosure of confidential medical, pharmacy or other health-related information concerning individual members, including the disclosure of the confidential information to the member’s health benefit plan.
 
On April 14, 2003, the final regulations issued by HHS, regarding the privacy of individually identifiable health information (the “Privacy Regulations”) pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) took effect. The Privacy Regulations are designed to protect the medical information of a healthcare patient or health plan enrollee that could be used to identify the individual.
 
The requirements imposed by the Privacy Regulations, the Transactions Standards, and the Security Standards are extensive and can require substantial cost and effort to assess and implement. We have taken and will continue to take steps that we believe are reasonable to ensure that our policies and procedures are following the Privacy Regulations, the Transactions Standards, and the Security Standards. The requirements imposed by HIPAA have increased our burden and costs of regulatory compliance, altered our reporting to Plan Sponsors and reduced the amount of information we can use or disclose if members do not authorize such uses or disclosures.
 
Medicare Part D. The Medicare Part D program, which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible Medicare beneficiaries, regulates various aspects of the provision of Medicare drug coverage, including enrollment, formularies, pharmacy networks, marketing, and claims processing. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) imposed restrictions and consent requirements for automatic prescription delivery programs, and further limited the circumstances under which Medicare Part D plans may recoup payments to pharmacies for claims that are subsequently determined not payable under Medicare Part D. CMS sanctions for non-compliance may include suspension of enrollment and even termination from the program.
 
The Medicare Part D program has undergone significant legislative and regulatory changes since its inception. Medicare Part D continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve. For example, CMS may issue regulations that limit the ability of Medicare Part D plans to establish preferred pharmacy networks.
 
Any Willing Provider Statutes and Narrow Networks. Any Willing Provider (“AWP”) statutes are laws that require health insurance carriers to permit providers to join those networks so long as the provider is willing to accept the terms and conditions of that carrier’s plan. Numerous states have some form of AWP law, though nearly all prohibit insurance carriers from limiting membership within their provider networks based on geography or other characteristics. The laws in each state addressing the legality of narrow networks vary widely. Some laws address plans only while other laws address non-insurers, like a PBM. Some laws address all types of health benefits while other laws only address a single type of benefit, like pharmacy. The risk to a pharmacy would be in those states that do not have an applicable AWP statute, a provider can be excluded from a narrow network.
 

11

While the offering of narrow and preferred networks is common across the country, there have been many lawsuits challenging the use of these type of arrangements due to the fact that they exclude certain providers from participating. The outcome of the challenges has varied, primarily based upon the interpretation of the state laws under which the challenges are made. This is an evolving area of law. Given the intense scrutiny of drug pricing and arrangements, and the ongoing lawsuits that are being filed in response to narrow networks, there remains risk in developing narrow networks, which will vary by state, depending on each state’s laws and legal precedent. Additionally, state laws are subject to change at any time, resulting in uncertainty for pharmacy operations in a given state.
 
Health Reform Legislation. Congress passed major health reform legislation, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “Health Reform Laws”), which enacted a number of significant healthcare reforms. There have been executive, judicial, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Reform Laws. For instance, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 included a provision that repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Health Reform Laws on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
