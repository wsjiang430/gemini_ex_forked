ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Clean Harbors, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "we," "Clean Harbors" or the "Company") is a leading provider of environmental, energy and industrial services throughout North America. We are also the largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil in the world and the largest provider of parts cleaning and related environmental services to commercial, industrial and automotive customers in North America. 
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, certain of our businesses undertook a reorganization which included changes to the underlying business and management structures. The reorganization resulted in combining the Environmental Services businesses from an operational and management perspective, deepening customer relationships and allowing for efficiencies across our operations through the sharing of resources, namely labor and equipment, which will reduce third party spending and promote cross selling of our business offerings. In connection with this reorganization, our chief operating decision maker requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. These changes required a reconsideration of our operating segments in the first quarter of 2018 and resulted in a change in our assessment of our operating segments. We concluded that we now have two operating segments for disclosure purposes; (i) the Environmental Services segment which consists of our historical Technical Services, Industrial Services, Field Services and Oil, Gas and Lodging businesses, and (ii) the Safety-Kleen segment.

• | Environmental Services - Environmental Services segment results are predicated upon the demand by our customers for waste services directly attributable to waste volumes generated by them and project work for which waste handling and/or disposal is required. In managing the business and evaluating performance, management tracks the volumes and mix of waste handled and disposed of through our owned incinerators and landfills, as well as utilization of such incinerators, labor and billable hours and equipment among other key metrics. Levels of activity and ultimate performance associated with this segment can be impacted by several factors including overall U.S. GDP and U.S. industrial production, weather conditions, efficiency of our operations, competition and market pricing of our services and the management of our related operating costs. Environmental Services results are also impacted by the demand for planned and unplanned industrial related cleaning and maintenance services at customer sites and for environmental cleanup services on a scheduled or emergency basis, including response to national events such as major oil spills, natural disasters or other events where immediate and specialized services are required.


• | Safety-Kleen - Safety-Kleen segment results are impacted by an array of core service offerings that serve to attract small quantity waste producers as customers and integrate them into the Clean Harbors waste network. Core service offerings include parts washer services, containerized waste services, vac services, used motor oil collection and sale of base and blended oil products as well as complementary products including automotive related fluids and shop supplies. Key performance indicators tracked by the Company relative to these services include the number of parts washer services performed and used motor oil and waste volumes collected. Results from these services are primarily driven by the overall number of parts washers placed at customer sites and volumes of waste collected. These factors can be impacted by overall economic conditions in the marketplace especially in the automotive related area. Safety-Kleen offers high quality base and blended oil products to end users including fleet customers, distributors, and manufacturers of oil products. Relative to these oil related products, management tracks the Company's volumes and relative percentages of base and blended oil sales along with various pricing metrics associated with the commodity driven marketplace. The segment’s results are 

1

significantly impacted by overall market pricing and product mix associated with base and blended oil products and, more specifically, the market prices of Group II base oils, which historically have correlated with overall crude oil prices. Costs incurred in connection with the collection of used oils and other raw materials associated with the segment’s oil related products can also be volatile. The implementation of our OilPlus® closed loop initiative resulting in the sale of our renewable oil products directly to our end customers will also impact future operating results.

Health and Safety
Health and Safety is our #1 priority. Employees at all levels of our Company share this philosophy and are committed to ensuring our safety goals are met. Our commitment to health and safety benefits everyone—our employees, our customers, the community, and the environment. In 2018, our successful Safety Starts With Me: Live It 3-6-5 program, which is a key component in our overall safety approach along with our many other programs, enabled us to achieve a low Total Recordable Incident Rate, or "TRIR;" Days Away, Restricted Activity and Transfer Rate, or "DART;" and Experience Modification Rate, or "EMR." For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Company wide TRIR, DART and EMR were 1.08, 0.63 and 0.58, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Company wide TRIR, DART and EMR were 1.34, 0.80 and 0.58, respectively.
In order to protect our employees, continue to lower our incident rates, and satisfy our customers' demands to retain the best service providers with the lowest TRIR, DART and EMR rates, we are fully committed to continuously improving our health and safety performance. All employees recognize the importance of protecting themselves, their fellow employees, their customers, and all those around them from harm. This commitment is supported by the philosophies and Golden Rules of Safety that is the cornerstone of the Safety Starts with Me: Live It 3-6-5 program. Live It 3-6-5 is our dedication to the safety of our workers through each and every employee’s commitment to our three Safety philosophies, our six Golden Rules of Safety and each employee’s five personal reasons why they choose to be safe at work, on the road and at home.
Compliance
We regard compliance with applicable environmental regulations as a critical component of our overall operations. We strive to maintain the highest professional standards in our compliance activities. Our compliance program has been developed for each of our waste management facilities and service centers under the direction of our compliance staff. The compliance staff is responsible for facilities permitting and regulatory compliance, compliance training, transportation compliance, and related record keeping. To ensure the effectiveness of our regulatory compliance program, our compliance staff monitors daily operational activities. We also have an Environmental Health and Safety Compliance Internal Audit Program designed to identify any weaknesses or opportunities for improvement in our ongoing compliance programs. We also perform periodic audits and inspections of the disposal facilities owned by other companies which we utilize.
Our facilities are frequently inspected and audited by regulatory agencies, as well as by customers. Although our facilities have been cited on occasion for regulatory violations, we believe that each of our facilities is currently in substantial compliance with applicable permit requirements.
Strategy
Our strategy is to develop and maintain ongoing relationships with a diversified group of customers that have recurring needs for environmental, energy or industrial services. We strive to be recognized as the premier supplier of a broad range of value-added services based upon quality, responsiveness, customer service, information technologies, breadth of service offerings and cost effectiveness.
The principal elements of our business strategy in no particular order are:

• | Cross-Sell Across Businesses—We believe the breadth of our service offerings allows us to provide additional services to existing customers and as such, the reorganization that took place during the first quarter of 2018 resulted

2

in deepening of our customer relationships and promoting the cross selling of such service offerings. We believe we can provide industrial and field services to customers that traditionally have only used our technical services and technical services to customers that use our industrial services or oil and gas field services. At the same time, we see a variety of cross-selling opportunities between our Environmental Services and Safety-Kleen segments. Reflecting this strategy, we have been successfully cross-selling the services of Safety-Kleen, such as parts washers, various cleaning products, recycling services and our OilPlus® closed loop initiative, to legacy Clean Harbors customers. We believe leveraging our ability to cross-sell across our segments will drive additional revenue for our Company.

• | Capture Large-Scale Projects—We provide turnkey offsite transportation and landfill or incineration disposal services for soil and other contaminated media generated from remediation activities. We also assist remediation contractors and project managers with support services including groundwater disposal, waste disposal, roll-off container management, and many other related services. We believe this will drive incremental waste volume to our existing facilities, thereby increasing utilization and enhancing overall profitability.


• | Expand Throughput Capacity of Existing Facilities—We operate an extensive network of hazardous waste management facilities and oil re-refineries and have made substantial investments in these facilities, which provide us with significant operating leverage as volumes increase. In addition, there are opportunities to expand waste handling capacity or waste oil processing at these facilities by modifying the terms of the existing permits and by adding equipment and new technology. Through selected permit modifications, we can expand the range of treatment services offered to our customers without the large capital investment necessary to acquire or build new waste management facilities.


• | Pursue Strategic Acquisitions—We actively pursue selective acquisitions in certain services or market sectors where we believe the acquisitions can enhance and expand our business. We believe that we can expand existing services through strategic acquisitions in order to generate incremental revenues from existing and new customers and to obtain greater market share. In order to maximize synergies, we rapidly integrate our acquisitions into our existing processes. For additional information on our acquisitions, see "Acquisitions and Divestitures" below.


• | Execute Strategic Divestitures—To complement our acquisition strategy and focus on internal growth, we regularly review and evaluate our existing operations to determine whether our business model should change through the divestiture of certain businesses. Accordingly, from time to time, we divest certain non-core businesses and reallocate our resources to businesses that we believe better align with our long-term strategic direction.


• | Focus on Cost, Pricing and Productivity Initiatives—We continually seek to increase efficiency and to reduce costs through enhanced technology, process efficiencies and stringent expense management. For instance, in 2018, we successfully undertook, in response to current and expected business conditions, branch consolidations, greater internalization of maintenance costs, procurement and supply chain improvements. Additionally, we seek areas in our business where strategic investment in processes, tools and employees can serve to increase productivity, efficiency and safety compliance.


• | Expand Service Offerings and Geographic Coverage—We believe our Environmental Services and Safety-Kleen segments have a competitive advantage due to their vast network of locations across North America, particularly in areas where we maintain service locations at or near a treatment, storage and disposal facility, or "TSDF." By opening additional service locations we believe that we can increase our market share within these segments. We believe this will drive additional waste into our existing facilities, thereby increasing utilization and enhancing overall profitability. In addition, our management team continues to assess the competitive landscape in order to identify new business opportunities.

Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions are an element of our business strategy that involves expansion through the purchase of businesses that complement our existing company and create multiple opportunities for profitable growth.
In 2018, we acquired the U.S. Industrial Cleaning Business of Veolia Environmental Services North America LLC (the "Veolia Business") as well as a privately-owned company for a combined preliminary purchase price of $151.3 million. The acquisitions provide significant scale and industrial services capabilities, while increasing the size of our existing U.S. Industrial Services business. The acquisitions were financed with cash on hand. The Veolia Business is included in our Environmental Services segment while the privately-owned company has components included in both the Environmental Services and Safety-Kleen segments.
 In 2017, we acquired Lonestar West Inc. ("Lonestar"), a public company headquartered in Alberta, Canada, for approximately CAD $41.8 million ($33.1 million USD), net of cash acquired. The acquisition price included the assumption of approximately CAD $21.3 million ($16.8 million USD) in outstanding debt, which we subsequently repaid. The acquisition 
3

supports our growth in the daylighting and hydro excavation services markets. In addition to increasing the size of our hydro vac fleet, Lonestar's network of locations provides us with direct access to key geographic markets in both the United States and Canada. The acquired company is included in our Environmental Services segment.
In 2016, we acquired seven businesses for a combined purchase price of $204.8 million, paid in cash and subject to customary post-closing adjustments, which complement our strategy to create a closed loop model as it relates to the sale and distribution of our oil products. These acquisitions also provided us three additional oil re-refineries while also expanding our used motor oil collection network and providing greater blending and packaging capabilities. These acquisitions also provided us with greater access to customers in the West Coast region of the United States and additional locations with Part B permits. Operations of these acquisitions are primarily being integrated across our Safety-Kleen segment, with certain operations also being integrated into our Environmental Services segment.
For additional information relating to our acquisition activities during 2018, 2017 and 2016, see Note 4, "Business Combinations," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Other business transactions also include divestitures based on our ongoing review of portfolio assets to determine the extent to which they are contributing to our objectives and growth strategy. 
In 2017 we completed the sale of our Transformer Services business, which was a non-core business previously included within the legacy Technical Services segment, for $45.5 million ($43.4 million net of $2.1 million in transactional related costs) subject to customary post-closing adjustments. In 2016 we completed the sale of our Catalyst Services business, which was a non-core business previously included within the legacy Industrial Services operating segment, for approximately $50.6 million ($49.2 million net of cash retained by the catalyst services business) subject to customary post-closing adjustments. For additional information relating to these divestitures, see Note 5, "Disposition of Businesses," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Protecting the Environment and Corporate Sustainability
Our core business is to provide industry, government and the public a wide range of environmental, energy and industrial services that protect and restore North America's natural environment.
As a leading provider of environmental, energy and industrial services throughout North America, our first goal is to help our customers prevent the release of chemicals and hazardous waste streams into the environment. We also are the leading service provider in the recovery and decontamination of pollutants that have been released. This includes the safe destruction or disposal of hazardous materials in a manner that ensures these materials are no longer a danger to the environment. When providing these services, we are committed to the recycling, reuse and reclamation of these wastes whenever possible using a variety of methods more fully explained below in the sections describing our general operations. Many of our branded services exemplify our commitment to sustainability and providing environmental solutions to the marketplace. Where possible, liquids such as solvents, chemicals and used oil are continuously recycled to our high-quality standards and made into useful products. Tolling programs provide a closed process in which the customer’s spent solvents are recycled to their precise specifications and returned directly to them.
In 2018 we gathered nearly 225 million gallons of used oil in North America through our Safety-Kleen business. Since their opening, our plants have re-refined more than 3.3 billion gallons of used oil, avoiding more than 27 million metric tons of greenhouse gases. 
We have also become the leading North American provider of services to protect the ozone layer from the destructive effects of chlorofluorocarbons, or "CFCs," which are ozone layer depleting substances and global warming compounds that have global warming potentials up to 10,000 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Global-warming potential is a relative measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere.
Since 2013, more than 7.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions were avoided by destroying CFCs at our Arkansas incinerator. That is equivalent to removing approximately 1.6 million passenger vehicles from the road for one year.
Our fleet of transportation vehicles represents one of our largest opportunities to apply sustainable business practices. Our Asset Refurbishment Program is a comprehensive effort to rebuild assets to "like new" quality. With four facilities now operational, we are able to rebuild approximately two vehicles every week. Our goal is 100% reuse or recycling of all materials.
One of our most highly visible public programs for various governmental and community entities involves the removal of thousands of tons of hazardous wastes, from households throughout the United States and Canada, that might otherwise be improperly disposed of or become dangerous to the communities where they are stored.
4

As we provide these wide-ranging services throughout North America, we are committed to ensuring that our own operations are environmentally responsible. Our sustainability efforts are guided by a formal policy, strategy and plan and we continue to build on our past efforts, such as implementing numerous energy efficiency improvements and various transportation initiatives within our fleet, including using our own recycled oil. We developed initiatives that focus on improving the Company's and our customers' impact on the environment. Our technologies and increased operational efficiencies have allowed us to deliver innovative customer solutions, like our Safety-Kleen Oil Plus® Program, that show our commitment to sustainable methodologies and transform the way we do business.
Competitive Strengths

• | Leading Provider of Environmental, Energy and Industrial Services—We are a leading provider of environmental, energy and industrial services. We own nine of the 13 commercial hazardous waste incinerators, making us the largest operator of such facilities in North America. We are also one of the few industrial services companies with national footprints in both the U.S. and Canada. We provide multi-faceted, high-quality services to a broad mix of customers. We attract and better serve our customers because of our vast capabilities and breadth of services as well as our overall size, scale and geographic location of our large network along with valuable and unique assets used in providing our services.


• | Integrated Network of Assets—We believe we operate, in the aggregate, the largest number of commercial hazardous waste incinerators, landfills, treatment facilities and TSDFs in North America. Our broad service network enables us to effectively handle a waste stream from its origin through disposal and to efficiently direct and internalize our waste streams to reduce costs. As our processing of wastes increases, our size allows us to leverage our network and increase our profit margins as we can internalize a greater volume of waste in our incinerators, landfills and other disposal facilities. Furthermore, these assets are very difficult to duplicate because significant permitting and regulatory approvals would need to take place in order for new waste disposal sites to come on line. High barriers of entry for such assets provide increased value to our network.


• | Comprehensive Service Capabilities—Our comprehensive service offerings allow us to act as a full-service provider to our customers. Our breadth of service offerings creates incremental revenue growth as customers seek to minimize the number of outside vendors and demand "one-stop-shop" service providers.


• | Largest Collector and Recycler of Used Motor Oil— As the largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil in the world, we returned during 2018 approximately 192 million gallons of new re-refined oil, lubricants and byproducts back into the marketplace. In 2018, our re-refining process eliminated more than two million metric tons of greenhouse gas ("GHG"), which is the equivalent of growing more than 54 million trees for 10 years in an urban environment or taking over 395,000 passenger cars off the road for one year.


• | Large and Diversified Customer Base—Our customers range from Fortune 500 companies to midsize and small public and private entities that span multiple industries and business types, including governmental entities. This diversification limits our credit exposure to any one customer and potential cyclicality to any one industry. As a percentage of our 2018 revenues, the top ten industries we service totaled approximately 76% and included general manufacturing (17%), chemical (14%), refineries (8%), base and blended oils (8%), automotive (7%), government (6%), utilities (5%), transportation (4%), oil and gas (4%) and construction (3%).


• | Stable and Recurring Revenue Base—We have long-standing relationships with our large customers, many of whom have worked with our Company for decades. Our diversified customer base provides stable and recurring revenues, as a significant portion of our revenues are derived from previously served customers with recurring needs for our services. In addition, switching costs for many of our hazardous waste customers are high. This is due to many customers' desire to audit disposal facilities prior to their qualification as approved sites and to limit the number of facilities to which their hazardous wastes are shipped in order to reduce their potential liability under United States and Canadian environmental laws and regulations. We have been selected as an approved vendor by large and small generators of waste because we possess comprehensive collection, recycling, treatment, transportation, disposal, and hazardous waste tracking capabilities and have the expertise necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Those customers that have selected us as an approved vendor typically continue to use our services on a recurring basis.


• | Regulatory Compliance—We continue to make capital investments in our facilities to ensure that they are in compliance with current federal, state, provincial and local regulations. Companies that rely on in-house disposal may find the current regulatory requirements to be too capital intensive or complicated, and may choose to outsource many of their hazardous waste disposal needs.

5


• | Effective Cost Management—Our significant scale allows us to maintain low costs through standardized compliance procedures, significant purchasing power, leveraging our investment in technology and our ability to efficiently utilize logistics and transportation to economically direct waste streams to the most efficient facility. We also have the ability to transport and process with internal resources the substantial majority of all hazardous waste that we manage for our customers. In addition, our Safety-Kleen results are significantly impacted by the overall market pricing and product mix associated with base and blended oil products and, more specifically, the market prices of Group II base oils. We charge fees related to our used oil collection services which allow us to effectively manage the profit spreads inherent in our business.


• | Proven and Experienced Management Team—Our executive management team provides depth and continuity. Our 12 executive officers collectively have over 200 years of experience and expertise in the environmental, energy and industrial services industries. Our chief executive officer founded our Company in 1980, and since its formation has served as both the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.

Operations
General
Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of Business. Our operations may be affected by seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers' spending for products and services. Typically during the first quarter of each year there is less demand for our products, oil collection, recycling and environmental services due to the lower levels of activities by our customers as a result of the cold weather, particularly in the Northern and Midwestern regions of the United States and Canada. As a result, reduced volumes of waste are received at our facilities, higher operating costs are realized due to sub-freezing weather and high levels of snowfall, factory closings for year-end holidays reduce waste volume, and lower volumes of used oil are generated for our collection.
Geographical Information.    For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $2,721.8 million or 82.5% of our direct revenues in the United States and $578.5 million or 17.5% of revenues in Canada. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $2,392.0 million or 81.2% of our direct revenues in the United States and $553.0 million or 18.8% of revenues in Canada. For additional information about the geographical areas from which our revenues are derived and in which our assets are located, see Note 19, "Segment Reporting," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Environmental Services
We collect, transport, treat and dispose of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, including resource recovery, physical treatment, fuel blending, incineration, landfill disposal, wastewater treatment, lab chemical disposal, explosives management and CleanPack® services. Our CleanPack® services include the collection, identification and categorization, specialized packaging, transportation and disposal of laboratory chemicals and household hazardous waste. We also perform a wide range of industrial maintenance and specialty industrial services and utilize specialty equipment and resources to perform field services at any chosen location on a planned or emergency response basis. All of these services are designed to protect the environment and address environmental related challenges through the use of innovation and the latest technologies. We provide customers with sustainable solutions that seek to recycle waste materials whenever possible.
Technical Services. We provide technical services through a network of service centers from which a fleet of vehicles are dispatched to pick up customers' waste either on a predetermined schedule or on demand, and to deliver the waste to permitted facilities, which are usually Company-owned. Our service centers also can dispatch chemists to a customer location for collection of chemical and laboratory waste for disposal. InSite Service offerings is a branded on-site/in-plant service delivery program through which we offer a full range of environmental, industrial and waste management services. This signature program is built on safety, quality, efficiency and integrity, and has been offered by Clean Harbors for more than 25 years. By leveraging Clean Harbors' expertise and capabilities, our on-site staffs are dedicated to developing the safest, most cost-effective solutions to service customers’ needs.
Collection, Transportation and Logistics Management.    As an integral part of our services, we collect industrial waste from customers and transport such waste to and between our facilities for treatment or bulking for shipment to final disposal locations. Customers typically accumulate waste in containers, such as 55-gallon drums, bulk storage tanks or 20-cubic-yard roll-off containers. In providing this service, we utilize a variety of specially designed and constructed tank trucks and semi-trailers as well as third-party transporters, including railroads.
Treatment and Disposal.    We recycle, treat and dispose of hazardous and non-hazardous industrial waste. The waste handled includes substances which are classified as "hazardous" because of their corrosive, ignitable, infectious, reactive or toxic properties, and other substances subject to federal, state and provincial environmental regulation. We provide final 
6

treatment and disposal services designed to manage waste which cannot be otherwise economically recycled or reused. The waste that we handle comes in solid, sludge, liquid and gas form.
We operate a network of TSDFs that collect, temporarily store and/or consolidate compatible waste streams for more efficient transportation to final recycling, treatment or disposal destinations. These facilities hold special permits, such as Part B permits under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or "RCRA," in the United States, which allow them to process, transfer and dispose of waste through various technologies including recycling, incineration, and landfill and wastewater treatment depending on each location's permitted and constructed capabilities. 
Resource Recovery and Fuel Blending.    We operate recycling systems for the reclamation and reuse of certain waste, particularly solvent-based waste generated by industrial cleaning operations, metal finishing and other manufacturing processes. Resource recovery involves the treatment of wastes using various methods, which effectively remove contaminants from the original material to restore its fitness for its intended purpose and to reduce the volume of waste requiring disposal.
We also operate a recycling facility that recycles refinery waste and spent catalyst. The recycled oil and catalysts, depending on market conditions, are sold to third parties.
Incineration.    Incineration is the preferred method for the treatment of organic hazardous waste because it effectively destroys the contaminants at high temperatures. High temperature incineration effectively eliminates organic waste such as herbicides, halogenated solvents, pesticides, pharmaceutical and refinery waste, regardless of whether gases, liquids, sludge or solids. Federal and state incineration regulations require a destruction and removal efficiency of 99.99% for most organic waste.
As of December 31, 2018, we had nine active incinerators operating in five incinerator facilities that offer a wide range of technological capabilities to customers. In the United States, we operate a fluidized bed thermal oxidation unit for maximum destruction efficiency of hazardous waste with an estimated annual practical capacity of 58,808 tons and three solids and liquids capable incinerator facilities with a combined estimated annual practical capacity of 377,387 tons. We also operate one hazardous waste liquid injection incinerator in Canada with total annual practical capacity of 125,526 tons.
Our incinerator facilities in Kimball, Nebraska; Deer Park, Texas; El Dorado, Arkansas; and Aragonite, Utah, are designed to process liquid organic waste, sludge, solids, soil and debris. Our Deer Park facility has two kilns and a rotary reactor. Our El Dorado facility specializes in the treatment of bulk and containerized hazardous liquids, solids and sludge. In 2017, we opened a new hazardous waste incinerator at our El Dorado, Arkansas facility, which specializes in high-temperature incineration of regulated waste such as industrial and laboratory chemicals, manufacturing byproducts, fertilizers and other solid and liquid materials that would otherwise be hazardous to the environment and public health if not properly managed. Our facilities in Kimball and Deer Park also have on-site landfills for the disposal of ash produced as a result of the incineration process.
Our incinerator facility in Lambton, Ontario, is a liquid injection incinerator, designed primarily for the destruction of liquid organic waste. Typical waste streams include wastewater with low levels of organics and other higher concentration organic liquid waste not amenable to conventional physical or chemical waste treatment.
Landfills.    Landfills are primarily used for disposal of inorganic waste. In the United States and Canada, we operate nine commercial landfills. Seven of our commercial landfills are designed and permitted for disposal of hazardous waste and two of our landfills are operated for non-hazardous industrial waste disposal and, to a lesser extent, municipal solid waste. In addition to our commercial landfills, we also own and operate, as described above, two non-commercial landfills that only accept waste from our on-site incinerators.
Of our seven commercial landfills used for disposal of hazardous waste, five are located in the United States and two are located in Canada. As of December 31, 2018, the useful economic lives of these landfills included approximately 25.6 million cubic yards of remaining capacity. This estimate of the useful economic lives of these landfills includes permitted airspace and unpermitted airspace that our management believes to be probable of being permitted based on our analysis of various factors. In addition to the capacity included in the useful economic lives of these landfills, there are approximately 31.9 million cubic yards of additional unpermitted airspace capacity included in the footprints of these landfills that may ultimately be permitted, although there can be no assurance that this additional capacity will be permitted. In addition to the hazardous waste landfills, we operate two non-hazardous industrial landfills with 3.8 million cubic yards of remaining permitted capacity. These two facilities are located in the United States and have been issued operating permits under Subtitle D of RCRA. Our non-hazardous landfill facilities are permitted to accept commercial industrial waste, including waste from foundries, demolition and construction, machine shops, automobile manufacturing, printing, metal fabrications and recycling.
Wastewater Treatment.    We operate nine wastewater treatment facilities that offer a range of wastewater treatment technologies. These wastewater treatment operations involve processing hazardous and non-hazardous waste through use of 
7

physical and chemical treatment methods. These facilities treat a broad range of industrial liquid and semi-liquid waste containing heavy metals, organics and suspended solids.
Total Project Management. We also provide total project management services in areas such as chemical packing, on-site waste management, remediation, compliance training and emergency spill response, while leveraging the Clean Harbors network of service centers and environmental capabilities.
Industrial Services.  We perform industrial maintenance services and specialty industrial services at refineries, mines, upgraders, chemical plants, pulp and paper mills, manufacturing, and power generation facilities. We provide these services throughout North America.
Our crews handle as-needed in-plant services to support ongoing in-plant cleaning and maintenance services, including liquid/dry vacuum, hydro-blasting, dewatering and materials processing, water and chemical hauling and steam cleaning. We provide a variety of specialized industrial services including plant outage and turnaround services, decoking and pigging, chemical cleaning, high and ultra-high pressure water cleaning, pipeline inspection and coating services, and large tank and surface impoundment cleaning. We also provide daylighting services which, through the use of specialized hydro vac equipment, deliver safer, cleaner and more precise hydro excavation services to safely uncover highly sensitive underground targets. Our crews also handle oilfield transport and production services supporting drilling, completions and production programs. 
Field and Emergency Response Services. Our crews and equipment are dispatched on a planned or emergency basis and perform services such as confined space entry for tank cleaning, site decontamination, large remediation projects, demolition, spill cleanup on land and water, railcar cleaning, product recovery and transfer, scarifying and media blasting and vacuum services. Additional services include filtration and water treatment services.
We are also a leader in providing response services for environmental emergencies of any scale from man-made disasters such as oil spills and natural disasters such as hurricanes.
Oil and Gas Field Services. We provide integrated seismic and right-of-way services for efficient resource discovery and site preparation. These services include: (i) seismic surveying that minimizes costs, environmental impact, and time in field; (ii) mulching/line clearing that expedites additional geophysical activities and minimizes environmental impact; and (iii) shot-hole drilling that provides safe and efficient operations in every terrain, including hostile and inaccessible regions. We also provide surface rentals services by supporting oil and gas companies' drilling and well completion programs. Key to our services is our ability to provide solids control to support the drilling process. Our technologies help manage liquids, solids and semi-solid material during the drilling operation, and include centrifuges, tanks, and drilling fluid recovery. We also can provide container rentals for safe collection of drill cuttings and other wastes, as well as manage disposal of drilling fluids and solids and can supply surface rental equipment to support drill sites by providing wellsite trailers, wastewater treatment systems and holding tanks, light towers, generators and handling tools.
Lodging Services. Our fixed lodges provide turnkey remote accommodations throughout Western Canada, primarily in the Fort McMurray area, and range in size up to approximately 600 beds. These are open lodges, with amenities that include catering and housekeeping services, fully equipped common areas, fitness rooms and computer rooms, wireless internet and public phones, powered parking stalls, laundry facilities, and daily towel service. We also offer mobile camp operations, which provide services for remote workforce accommodation facilities throughout Western Canada, currently in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta, with multiple accommodation types. These include client and open camps, operator camps, and drill camps. Furthermore, hospitality services are available as a standalone service to clients which have other accommodation arrangements. 
Safety-Kleen
Our Safety-Kleen business offers an array of environmental services and complementary products to a diverse range of customers including automobile repair shops, car and truck dealers, metal fabricators, machine manufacturers, fleet maintenance shops and other automotive, industrial and retail customers.
As the largest provider of parts cleaning services in North America, Safety-Kleen offers a complete line of specially designed parts washers to customer locations and then delivers recurring service that includes machine cleaning and maintenance and disposal and replacement of clean solvent or aqueous fluids. We also sell automotive and industrial cleaning products which include degreasers, glass and floor cleaners, hand cleaners, absorbents, antifreeze, windshield washer fluid, mats and spill kits. 
Utilizing our collection network, we provide pickup and transportation of hazardous and non-hazardous containerized waste for recycling or disposal, primarily through the Clean Harbors network of recycling and waste treatment and disposal

facilities. We also collect used oil which serves as feedstock for our oil re-refineries discussed below, or process the oil into recycled fuel oil, or “RFO,” which is then sold to customers such as asphalt plants, industrial plants, pulp and paper companies, and vacuum gas oil and marine diesel oil producers.
Our vacuum services remove solids, residual oily water and sludge and other fluids from customers' oil/water separators, sumps and collection tanks. We also remove and collect waste fluids found at large and small industrial locations, including metal fabricators, auto maintenance providers, and general manufacturers.
Utilizing used oil collected by Safety-Kleen branches, we manufacture, formulate, package, distribute and market high-quality lubricants. We offer these products and services direct to business end-users and customers that can in turn market to retailers and end-consumers. The used oil collected by Safety-Kleen's branch network is processed or re-refined to convert into a variety of products, mostly base lubricating oils, and much smaller quantities of asphalt-like material, glycols and fuels. As the largest re-refiner of used oil in North America, we can process the used oil collected through our six re-refineries located in East Chicago, Indiana; Newark, California; Wichita, Kansas; Tacoma, Washington; Fallon, Nevada; and Breslau, Ontario.
Our primary goal is to produce and sell high-quality blended oils, which are created by combining our re-refined base and other base oils with performance additives in accordance with our proprietary formulations and American Petroleum Institute licenses. Our Performance Plus® brand and “green” proprietary brand EcoPower® are sold to on- and off-road corporate fleets, government entities, automotive service shops and industrial plants, which are serviced through our internal distribution network, as well as an extensive United States and Canada-wide independent distributor network. We also sell unbranded blended oils to distributors that resell them under their private label brands. Our OilPlus® program consists of selling our renewable oil products directly to our end customers. We sell the base oil that we do not blend and sell ourselves to independent blenders/packagers that use it to blend their own branded or private label oils. With more than 200 million gallons of used oil processed annually, we were able to return in 2018 approximately 192 million gallons of new re-refined oil, lubricants and byproducts back into the marketplace. We believe our position as the largest collector and re-refiner of used motor oil, along with our vast service and distributions network, provide a distinct competitive advantage in our ability to provide our customers with collection and oil distribution services through our OilPlus® program.
Competition
The hazardous waste management industry is highly competitive. The sources of competition vary by locality and by type of service rendered, with competition coming from national and regional waste services companies and hundreds of privately-owned firms. Veolia North America, Waste Management, Inc., U.S. Ecology, and Stericycle, Inc. are the principal national firms with which we compete. Each of these competitors is able to provide one or more of the environmental services we offer.
Under federal and state environmental laws in the United States, generators of hazardous wastes remain liable for improper disposal of such wastes. Although generators may hire various companies that have the proper permits and licenses, because of the generators' potential liability, they are very interested in the reputation and financial strength of the companies they use for the management of their hazardous wastes. We believe that our technical proficiency, safety record, customer service oriented culture and overall reputation are important considerations to our customers in selecting and continuing to utilize our services. We also believe that the depth of our recycling, treatment and disposal capabilities, our ability to collect and transport waste products efficiently, and pricing are additional significant factors in the market for treatment and disposal services.
Competition within our Environmental Services segment varies by locality and type of service rendered.
•For our landfill and waste services, competitors include several major national and regional environmental services firms, as well as numerous smaller local firms. We believe the availability of skilled technical professional personnel, quality of performance, diversity of services, safety record, quality of assets and use of current and latest technologies, as well as price, are the key competitive factors in this service industry.
•For our industrial, field and emergency responses services, competitors vary by locality and by type of service rendered, with competition coming from national and regional service providers and hundreds of privately-owned firms that offer energy or industrial services. CEDA International Corporation and Newalta in Canada, and Envirosystems and Hydrochem PSC in the United States, are the principal national firms with which we compete. Each of these competitors is able to provide one or more of the industrial and field services we offer. We believe the availability of specialized equipment and latest technologies, skilled technical professional personnel, quality of performance, diversity of services, safety record and price are the key competitive factors in this industry.

•For our energy related services, competitors vary by locality and type of services provided, with competition coming from national, regional and local service providers. Competition is based on a number of factors, including safety, quality, performance, reliability, service, price, response time and, in some cases, breadth of service offering.
For our Safety-Kleen segment, competitors vary by locality and by type of service rendered, with competition coming from Heritage-Crystal Clean and Veolia North America, along with several regional and local firms. With our Safety-Kleen Oil Plus® closed loop offering, we are competing in certain markets with other North American lubricant distributors.
The principal methods of competition for all of our services are quality, price, reliability of service rendered and technical proficiency. We believe that we offer a more comprehensive range of environmental, energy and industrial services than our competitors in major portions of the United States and Canada.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 14,200 active full-time employees, of which 898 in the United States and 547 in Canada were represented by labor unions. We believe that our relationship with our employees is positive. As part of our commitment to employee safety and quality customer service, we have an extensive compliance program and trained environmental, health and safety staff. We adhere to a risk management program designed to reduce potential liabilities to us and to our customers. We also continually strive to invest in our employees through training programs as well as competitive compensation and benefit programs
Intellectual Property
We have invested significantly in the development of proprietary technology and also to establish and maintain an extensive knowledge of leading technologies and incorporate these technologies into the services we offer and provide to our customers. As of December 31, 2018, we held a total of 32 U.S. and nine foreign issued or granted patents (which will expire between 2019 and 2031), two U.S. and five foreign pending patent applications, 96 U.S. and 63 foreign trademark registrations, and one U.S. and six foreign trademark applications. We also license software and other intellectual property from various third parties. We enter into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and control access to software documentation and other proprietary information. We believe that we hold adequate rights to all intellectual property used in our business and that we do not infringe upon any intellectual property rights held by other parties.
Management of Risks
We adhere to a program of risk management policies and practices designed to reduce potential liability, as well as to manage customers' ongoing environmental exposures. This program includes installation of risk management systems at our facilities, such as fire suppression, employee training, environmental, auditing and policy decisions restricting the types of wastes handled. We evaluate all revenue opportunities and decline those that we believe involve unacceptable risks.
We dispose of wastes at our incinerator, wastewater treatment and landfill facilities, or at facilities owned and operated by other firms that we have audited and approved. We apply established technologies to treatment, storage and recovery of hazardous wastes. We believe our operations are conducted in a safe and prudent manner and in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Insurance and Financial Assurance
Our insurance programs cover the potential risks associated with our multifaceted operations from two primary exposures: direct physical damage and third-party liability. We maintain a casualty insurance program providing coverage for vehicles, employer's liability and commercial general liability in the aggregate amount of $105.0 million, $102.0 million and $102.0 million, respectively, per year, subject to retentions of $2.0 million per occurrence for auto and commercial general liability and $1.0 million for employers' liability in the United States and $2.0 million in Canada. We also have workers' compensation insurance whose limits are established by state statutes. 
We have pollution liability insurance policies covering potential risks in three areas: as a contractor performing services at customer sites, as a transporter of waste, and as a processor of waste at our facilities. The contractor's pollution liability insurance has limits of $20.0 million per occurrence and $25.0 million in the aggregate, covering offsite remedial activities and associated liabilities.
For sudden and accidental in-transit pollution liability, our auto liability policy provides the primary $5.0 million per occurrence of transportation pollution insurance. Our pollution liability policies provide an additional $60.0 million per occurrence and $85.0 million in the aggregate for a total of $65.0 million per occurrence and $90.0 million, respectively. A $2.0 million deductible per occurrence applies to this coverage in the United States and Canada.
10

Federal and state regulations require liability insurance coverage for all facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. RCRA, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and comparable state hazardous waste regulations typically require hazardous waste handling facilities to maintain pollution liability insurance in the amount of $1.0 million per occurrence and $2.0 million in the aggregate for sudden occurrences, and $3.0 million per occurrence and $6.0 million in the aggregate for non-sudden occurrences. Our liability insurance coverage meets or exceeds all federal and state regulations.
Our international operations are insured under locally placed insurance policies that are compulsory in a specific country. In addition, we have a global foreign liability policy that will provide excess and difference in condition coverage in international countries. 
Under our insurance programs, coverage is obtained for catastrophic exposures, cyber security as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. It is our policy to retain a significant portion of certain expected losses related primarily to employee benefit, workers' compensation, commercial general and vehicle liability. Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon our estimates of the actuarial calculation of the aggregate liability for claims. We believe that policy cancellation terms are similar to those of companies in other industries.
Operators of hazardous waste handling facilities are also required by federal, state and provincial regulations to provide financial assurance for closure and post-closure care of those facilities should the facilities cease operation. Closure would include the cost of removing the waste stored at a facility which ceased operating and sending the material to another facility for disposal and the cost of performing certain procedures for decontamination of the facility. As of December 31, 2018, our total estimated closure and post-closure costs requiring financial assurance by regulators were $464.2 million for our U.S. facilities and $42.1 million for our Canadian facilities. We have obtained all of the required financial assurance for our facilities through a combination of surety bonds, funded trusts, letters of credit and insurance from a qualified insurance company. The financial assurance related to closure and post-closure obligations of our U.S. facilities will renew in 2019. Our Canadian facilities utilize surety bonds, which renew at various dates throughout 2019, as well as letters of credit. 
Environmental Regulation
While our business has benefited substantially from increased governmental regulation of hazardous waste transportation, storage and disposal, the environmental services industry itself is the subject of extensive and evolving regulation by federal, state, provincial and local authorities. We are required to obtain federal, state, provincial and local permits or approvals for each of our hazardous waste facilities. Such permits are difficult to obtain and, in many instances, extensive studies, tests, and public hearings are required before the approvals can be issued. We have acquired all operating permits and approvals now required for the current operation of our business, and have applied for, or are in the process of applying for, all permits and approvals needed in connection with continued operation and planned expansion or modifications of our operations.
We make a continuing effort to anticipate regulatory, political and legal developments that might affect operations, but are not always able to do so. We cannot predict the extent to which any environmental legislation or regulation that may be enacted or enforced in the future may affect our operations.
A new regulation primarily impacting the shipping business but which we are monitoring closely as it could impact our business is known as “IMO 2020”. On January 1, 2020, the International Maritime Organization (the "IMO") will implement a new regulation for a 0.50% global sulphur cap for marine fuels. Under the new global cap, ships that traverse the oceans will be required to use marine fuels with a sulphur content of no more than 0.50%, versus the current limit of 3.50%, in an effort to reduce the amount of sulphur oxide and decrease pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the global shipping fleet, which now uses an estimated 3.5 - 4 million barrels per day of fuel oil. The shipping industry is the last major transportation sector to utilize fuel with high levels of sulfur, which is the reason the IMO is pushing the industry to more closely align with other transport sectors for pollution reduction.
There are several variables around this regulatory change that are not yet clear, including anticipated levels of compliance and enforcement. However, it is expected that the implementation of IMO 2020 will result in a significant increase in near-term demand for a broad range of low sulfur distillates including diesel, marine gas oil, marine diesel oil and vacuum gas oil ("VGO") among others. There is uncertainty about the global refinery industry’s ability to meet that spike in demand, which could have substantial consequences for the pricing of those products, particularly VGO. The price of VGO typically has a direct impact on the pricing and/or levels of production of base oil. Changes in the marine fuel market as a result of IMO 2020 is also expected to affect the availability of used motor oil, which today is frequently used in the marine market and some of which may be displaced as a result of this new rule.

United States Hazardous Waste Regulation
Federal Regulations.    The most significant federal environmental laws affecting us are the RCRA, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or "CERCLA," also known as the "Superfund Act," the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act, or "TSCA."
RCRA.    RCRA is the principal federal statute governing hazardous waste generation, treatment, transportation, storage and disposal. Pursuant to RCRA, the EPA has established a comprehensive "cradle-to-grave" system for the management of a wide range of materials identified as hazardous waste. States that have adopted hazardous waste management programs with standards at least as stringent as those promulgated by the EPA have been delegated authority by the EPA to administer their facility permitting programs in lieu of the EPA's program.
Every facility that treats, stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a RCRA permit from the EPA or an authorized state agency unless a specific exemption exists, and must comply with certain operating requirements (the Part B permitting process). RCRA also requires that Part B permits contain provisions for required on-site study and cleanup activities, known as "corrective action," including detailed compliance schedules and provisions for assurance of financial responsibility. See Note 10, "Closure and Post-Closure Liabilities," and Note 11, "Remedial Liabilities," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our environmental liabilities. See "Insurance and Financial Assurance" above for a discussion of our financial assurance requirements.
The Superfund Act.    The Superfund Act is the primary federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties. It also provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA to releases of hazardous substances into the environment, and authorizes the government to respond to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances or to order responsible persons to perform any necessary cleanup. The statute provides for strict and, in certain cases, joint and several liability for these responses and other related costs, and for liability for the cost of damages to natural resources, to the parties involved in the generation, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances. Under the statute, we may be deemed liable as a generator or transporter of a hazardous substance which is released into the environment, or as the owner or operator of a facility from which there is a release of a hazardous substance into the environment. See Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for a description of the principal such proceedings in which we are now involved.
The Clean Air Act.    The Clean Air Act was passed by Congress to control the emissions of pollutants into the air and requires permits to be obtained for certain sources of toxic air pollutants such as vinyl chloride, or criteria pollutants, such as carbon monoxide. In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to require further reductions of air pollutants with specific targets for non-attainment areas in order to meet certain ambient air quality standards. These amendments also require the EPA to promulgate regulations which (i) control emissions of 189 hazardous air pollutants; (ii) create uniform operating permits for major industrial facilities similar to RCRA operating permits; (iii) mandate the phase-out of ozone depleting chemicals; and (iv) provide for enhanced enforcement.
The Clean Water Act.    This legislation prohibits discharge of pollutants into the waters of the United States without governmental authorization and regulates the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and sewers from a variety of sources, including disposal sites and treatment facilities. The EPA has promulgated "pretreatment" regulations under the Clean Water Act, which establish pretreatment standards for introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works. In the course of the treatment process, our wastewater treatment facilities generate wastewater, which we discharge to publicly owned treatment works pursuant to permits issued by the appropriate governmental authorities. We are required to obtain discharge permits and conduct sampling and monitoring programs. 
TSCA.    We also operate a network of collection, treatment and field services (remediation) activities throughout North America that are regulated under provisions of TSCA. TSCA established a national program for the management of substances classified as polychlorinated biphenyls, or "PCBs," which include waste PCBs as well as RCRA wastes contaminated with PCBs. The rules set minimum design and operating requirements for storage, treatment and disposal of PCB wastes. Since their initial publication, the rules have been modified to enhance the management standards for TSCA-regulated operations including the decommissioning of PCB transformers and articles, detoxification of transformer oils, incineration of PCB liquids and solids, landfill disposal of PCB solids, and remediation of PCB contamination at customer sites.
Other Federal Laws.    In addition to regulations specifically directed at our transportation, storage, and disposal facilities, there are a number of regulations that may "pass-through" to the facilities based on the acceptance of regulated waste from affected client facilities. Each facility that accepts affected waste must comply with the regulations for that waste, facility or industry. Examples of this type of regulation are National Emission Standards for Benzene Waste Operations and National 
12

Emissions Standards for Pharmaceuticals Production. Each of our facilities addresses these regulations on a case-by-case basis determined by its ability to comply with the pass-through regulations.
In our transportation operations, we are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as by the regulatory agencies of each state in which we operate or through which our vehicles pass.
Health and safety standards under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or "OSHA," are also applicable to all of our operations.
State and Local Regulations. Pursuant to the EPA's authorization of their RCRA equivalent programs, a number of U.S. states have regulatory programs governing the operations and permitting of hazardous waste facilities. Accordingly, the hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal activities of a number of our facilities are regulated by the relevant state agencies in addition to federal EPA regulation.
Some states classify as hazardous some wastes that are not regulated under RCRA. For example, Massachusetts considers used oil as "hazardous waste" while RCRA does not. Accordingly, we must comply with state requirements for handling state regulated wastes, and, when necessary, obtain state licenses for treating, storing, and disposing of such wastes at our facilities.
Our facilities are regulated pursuant to state statutes, including those addressing clean water and clean air. Local sewer discharge and flammable storage requirements are applicable to certain of our facilities. Our facilities are also subject to local siting, zoning and land use restrictions. We believe that each of our facilities is in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of federal and state licenses which we have obtained. Once issued, such licenses have maximum fixed terms of a given number of years, which differ from state to state, ranging from three to ten years. The issuing state agency may review or modify a license at any time during its term. We anticipate that once a license is issued with respect to a facility, the license will be renewed at the end of its term if the facility's operations are in compliance with applicable requirements. However, there can be no assurance that regulations governing future licensing will remain static, or that we will be able to comply with such requirements.
Canadian Hazardous Waste Regulation
In Canada, the provinces retain control over environmental issues within their boundaries and thus have the primary responsibility for regulating management of hazardous wastes. The federal government regulates issues of national scope or where activities cross provincial boundaries.
Provincial Regulations.    Most of Canada's industrial development and the major part of its population are located in four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia. These provinces have the most detailed environmental regulations. We operate major waste management facilities in each of these provinces, as well as waste transfer facilities in Nova Scotia and Manitoba.
The main provincial acts dealing with hazardous waste management are:

• | Ontario—Environmental Protection Act;


• | Quebec—Environmental Quality Act;


• | Alberta—Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act; and


• | British Columbia—Waste Management Act.

These pieces of legislation were developed by the provinces independently and, among other things, generally control the generation, characterization, transport, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes. Regulations developed by the provinces under the relevant legislation are also developed independently, but are often quite similar in effect and sometimes in application. For example, there is some uniformity in manifest design and utilization.
Provincial legislation also provides for the establishment of waste management facilities. In this case, the facilities are also controlled by provincial statutes and regulations governing emissions to air, groundwater and surface water and prescribing design criteria and operational guidelines.
Waste transporters require a permit to operate under provincial waste management regulations and are subject to the requirements of the Federal Transportation of Dangerous Goods legislation. They are required to report the quantities and disposition of materials shipped.
13

Canadian Federal Regulations.    The Canadian federal government has authority for those matters which are national in scope and in impact and for Canada's relations with other nations. The main federal laws governing hazardous waste management are:

• | Canadian Environmental Protection Act (1999) ("CEPA 99"), and


• | Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act.

Environment Canada is the federal agency with responsibility for environmental matters and the main legislative instrument is the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. This act charges Environment Canada and Health Canada with protection of human health and the environment and seeks to control the production, importation and use of substances in Canada and to control their impact on the environment.
The Export and Import of Hazardous Wastes Regulations under CEPA 99 control the export and import of hazardous wastes and hazardous recyclable materials. By reference, these regulations incorporate the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act and Regulations, which address identification, packaging, marking and documentation of hazardous materials during transport. CEPA 99 requires that anyone proposing to export or import hazardous wastes or hazardous recyclable materials or to transport them through Canada notify the Minister of the Environment and obtain a permit to do so. Section 9 of CEPA 99 allows the federal government to enter into administrative agreements with the provinces and territories for the development and improvement of environmental standards. These agreements represent cooperation towards a common goal rather than a delegation of authority under CEPA 99. To facilitate the development of provincial and territorial agreements, the federal, provincial and territorial governments participate in the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment ("CCME"). The CCME comprises the 14 environment ministers from the federal, provincial and territorial governments, who normally meet twice a year to discuss national environmental priorities and to determine work to be carried out under the auspices of the CCME.
Canadian Local and Municipal Regulations.    Local and municipal regulations seldom reference direct control of hazardous waste management activities. Municipal regulations and by-laws, however, control such issues as land use designation, access to municipal services and use of emergency services, all of which can have a significant impact on facility operation.
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
We incur costs and make capital investments in order to comply with the previously discussed environmental regulations. These regulations require that we remediate contaminated sites, operate our facilities in accordance with enacted regulations, obtain required financial assurance for closure and post-closure care of our facilities should such facilities cease operations, and make capital investments in order to keep our facilities in compliance with environmental regulations.
As further discussed in Note 10, "Closure and Post-Closure Liabilities," and Note 11, "Remedial Liabilities," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report, we have accrued environmental liabilities as of December 31, 2018, of $190.9 million. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we spent $10.1 million and $13.0 million, respectively, to address environmental liabilities.
As discussed more fully above under the heading "Insurance and Financial Assurance," we are required to provide financial assurance with respect to certain statutorily required closure, post-closure and corrective action obligations at our facilities. We have placed the required financial assurance primarily through a qualified insurance company.
As described in Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report, we are involved in legal proceedings arising under environmental laws and regulations. Alleged failure to comply with laws and regulations may lead to the imposition of fines or the denial, revocation or delay of the renewal of permits and licenses by governmental entities. In addition, such governmental entities, as well as surrounding landowners, may claim that we are liable for environmental damages. Citizens groups have become increasingly active in challenging the grant or renewal of permits and licenses for hazardous waste facilities, and responding to such challenges has further increased the costs associated with establishing new facilities or expanding current facilities. A significant judgment against us, the loss of a significant permit or license, or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material effect on our business and future prospects.
