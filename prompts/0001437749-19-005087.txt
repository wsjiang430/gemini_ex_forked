Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
Unless otherwise indicated, the terms “the Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” are used in this 2018 Form 10-K to refer to Northwest Pipe Company or one of our consolidated subsidiaries or to all of them taken as a whole. We were incorporated in the State of Oregon in 1966.
 
Overview
 
Northwest Pipe Company is the largest manufacturer of engineered welded steel pipe water systems in North America. Our manufacturing facilities are strategically positioned to meet North America’s growing needs for water and wastewater infrastructure. Our solution-based products serve a wide range of markets including water transmission, plant piping, tunnels, and river crossings. Our prominent position is based on a widely-recognized reputation for quality, service, and manufacturing to meet performance expectations in all categories including highly-corrosive environments.
 
As the leader in manufacturing large-diameter, high-pressure, engineered welded steel pipeline systems, our sales have historically been driven by the need for new water infrastructure. In addition to fabricating pipes for water transmission primarily related to drinking water systems, we also make products for hydroelectric power systems, wastewater systems, industrial plant piping systems, and certain structural applications.
 
With steady population growth and regional community expansion, as well as continued drought conditions, existing water sources have become stressed. Combined with a recognized trend of increased spending on water infrastructure replacement, repair and upgrades, Northwest Pipe Company sees continued opportunities for growth in North American infrastructure.
 
Recent Strategic Actions
 
In July 2018, we completed the acquisition of 100% of Ameron Water Transmission Group, LLC (“Ameron”) for a purchase price of $38.1 million. Ameron was a major supplier of engineered welded steel pressure pipe as well as reinforced concrete pipe. In addition to strengthening our position in the water transmission pipe market, this acquisition expands our bar-wrapped concrete cylinder pipe capabilities and adds reinforced concrete pipe and T-Lock®—a proprietary polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) lining for concrete pipe sewer applications—to our product portfolio. In connection with the acquisition, we acquired pipe facilities in Tracy, California and San Luis Río Colorado, Mexico, as well as a protective lining facility in Brea, California.
 
In the second quarter of 2018, we closed our leased Permalok® facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, and moved production to our Permalok® facility in St. Louis, Missouri. This move eliminated redundant overhead and increased production flexibility. In addition, we obtained the capability to manufacture our Permalok® product at our Adelanto, California facility, which increases utilization of existing assets and furthers our access to the West Coast trenchless market.
 
Production at our manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico ceased early in the second quarter of 2018, and the facility was sold in December 2018.
 
Our Industry
 
Much of the United States water infrastructure is antiquated and many authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), believe the United States water infrastructure is in critical need of update, repair, or replacement. In its 2015 Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment released in March 2018, the EPA estimated the nation will need to spend $473 billion in infrastructure investments by 2034 to continue to provide safe drinking water to the public. The American Society of Civil Engineers (“ASCE”) has given poor ratings to many aspects of the United States water infrastructure in their 2017 Infrastructure Report Card for Drinking Water. In its Failure to Act: Closing the Infrastructure Investment Gap for America’s Economic Future study published in 2016, the ASCE concludes that significant portions of many municipal water systems are 40 to 50 years old and are nearing the end of their useful lives, and estimates there will be $150 billion in capital investment needs for water and wastewater infrastructure by 2025, and $204 billion in capital investment needs by 2040. The American Water Works Association concluded in their 2012 report, Buried No Longer: Confronting America’s Water Infrastructure Challenge, that from 2011 to 2035 more than $1 trillion will be needed to repair and expand drinking water infrastructure.
 
Within this market, we focus on large-diameter, engineered welded steel pipeline systems utilized in water, energy, structural, and plant piping applications. Our core market is the large-diameter, high-pressure portion of a water transmission pipeline that is typically at the “upper end” of a pipeline system. This is the portion of the overall water pipeline that generally transports water from the source to a treatment plant or from a treatment plant into the distribution system, rather than the small lines that deliver water directly into households. We believe the total addressable market for the products sold will be approximately $2.1 billion over the next three years.

A combination of new population centers, rising demand on developed water sources, substantial underinvestment in water infrastructure over the past several decades, and increasingly stringent regulatory policies are driving demand for water infrastructure projects in the United States. These trends are intensifying the need for new water infrastructure as well as the need to upgrade, repair, and replace existing water infrastructure. While we believe this offers the potential for increased demand for our water infrastructure products and other products related to water transmission, we also expect that current governmental and public water agency budgetary pressures could impact near-term demand.
 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the population of the United States will increase by approximately 61 million people between 2019 and 2050. The resulting increase in demand will require substantial new infrastructure, as the existing United States water infrastructure is not equipped to provide water to millions of new residents. The development of new sources of water at greater distances from population centers will drive the demand for new water transmission lines. The 2019 Dodge Construction Outlook forecasts public works construction starts will grow by 4% from 2018 levels.
 
As water systems degrade over time and cause failures, many current water supply sources are in danger of being exhausted. Much of the drinking water infrastructure in major cities was built in the mid-20th century with a lifespan of 75 to 100 years. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card for Drinking Water, the ASCE estimates there are 240,000 water main breaks per year in the United States, wasting over two trillion gallons of treated drinking water, which equates to 14% to 18% of each day’s treated water. The ASCE also reports that with utilities averaging a pipe replacement rate of 0.5% per year, it will take an estimated 200 years to replace the system – nearly double the useful life of the pipes. These aging water and wastewater systems will drive demand for future investment.
 
Finally, the increased public awareness of problems with the quality of drinking water and efficient water usage has resulted in more stringent application of federal and state environmental regulations. The need to comply with these regulations in an environment of heightened public awareness is expected to contribute to demand in the water infrastructure industry.
 
Federal initiatives to improve the conditions of the aging water infrastructure include the Water Infrastructure and Resiliency Finance Center at the EPA and the Water and Environmental Programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. Senate passed the latest Water Resources Development Act, which was included in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act signed by the President in December 2016. This authorizes new infrastructure projects around the country and contains substantive provisions in regards to drinking water infrastructure. Additionally, the EPA’s Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (“WIFIA”) program provides approximately $2 billion in credit assistance for water infrastructure projects. In an April 2018 EPA press release, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said, “Thanks to the President’s leadership, this WIFIA funding will spark new investments to repair our nation’s crumbling water infrastructure. EPA will play a key role in the President’s infrastructure efforts by incentivizing states, municipalities, and public-private partnerships to protect public health, fix local infrastructure problems, create jobs, and provide clean water to communities.”
 
In addition to the Federal initiatives, individual states are also taking action. In November 2014, the State of California approved the Water Quality, Supply and Infrastructure Improvement Act (“Proposition 1”). Proposition 1 authorizes $7.5 billion in general obligation bonds to fund state water supply infrastructure projects, such as public water system improvements, surface and groundwater storage, drinking water protection, water recycling and advanced water treatment technology, water supply management and conveyance, wastewater treatment, drought relief, emergency water supplies, and ecosystem and watershed protection and restoration. The State of Texas has earmarked $27 billion of future bond funding for state water projects over the next 50 years through their State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT). This program provides low-interest and deferred loans to state agencies making approved investments in water infrastructure projects. Our strategically located manufacturing facilities are well-positioned to take advantage of the anticipated growth in demand.
 
Products
 
Water transmission pipe is used for high-pressure applications, typically requiring pipe to withstand pressures in excess of 150 pounds per square inch. Most of our water transmission products, mainly welded steel pipe and bar-wrapped cylinder pipe, are made to project specifications for fully engineered, large-diameter, high-pressure water infrastructure systems. Other uses include power generation circulating water systems, penstocks, pipe piling, and water and wastewater treatment plants. Spiral welded pipe is manufactured in diameters ranging from 24 inches to 156 inches with wall thickness of 0.135 inch to 1.00 inch. Our rolled and welded capabilities allow for manufacturing diameters greater than 156 inches or wall thicknesses exceeding 1.00 inch. Linings and coating capabilities include cement mortar, polyurethane, epoxies, polyethylene tape, and coal-tar enamel according to our customers’ project specifications. Fabrication of fitting and specials are performed at our own facilities providing installation contractors and project owners with a complete engineered system. Product is delivered to the jobsite using commercial trucks or marine transport as needed.

We manufacture Permalok® steel casing pipe, which is a proprietary pipe joining system that employs a press-fit interlocking connection system. The Permalok® product is generally installed in trenchless construction projects. In 2018, we added T-Lock® and Arrow-Lock® Sheet Lining Systems to our product line. The PVC sheet material provides protection against hydrogen sulfide gas, acids, alkalis, salt, and other forms of corrosion in precast concrete pipe, concrete structures, and monolithic tunnels. T-Lock® is applied during concrete casting and permanently locks into place as a part of the substrate. Arrow-Lock® can be used in both new and rehabilitation projects. The flexible sheets can be easily shaped over intricate forms, making it ideal for manholes, lift stations, digesters, primary effluent channels, sludge wet wells, primary sedimentation tanks, and headworks. Additionally we manufacture wet-cast reinforced concrete pipe typically used in non-pressure, gravity fed sewer and stormwater applications.
 
Marketing
 
Our plant locations in Oregon, Mexico, California, Texas, West Virginia, and Missouri allow us to efficiently serve customers throughout North America. Our marketing strategy emphasizes early identification of potential water projects, promotion of specifications consistent with our capabilities and products, and close contact with the project designers and owners throughout the design phase. Our in-house sales force is comprised of sales representatives, engineers, and support personnel who work closely with public water agencies, contractors, and engineering firms, often years in advance of projects being bid. These relationships allow us to identify and evaluate planned projects at early stages, and pursue these projects by offering technical support and resources. After an agency completes a design, they publicize the upcoming bid for a water transmission project. We then obtain detailed plans and develop our estimate for the pipe portion of the project. We typically bid to installation contractors who include our bid in their proposals to public water agencies. A public water agency generally awards the entire project to the contractor with the lowest responsive bid.
 
As such, the primary customers for our water transmission products are installation contractors for projects funded by public water agencies. No customer accounted for 10% or more of total Net sales from continuing operations in 2018 or 2017. One customer accounted for 28% of total Net sales from continuing operations in 2016. We do not believe the potential loss of this customer would have had an adverse effect on our business, due to the nature of the industry and the competition between installation contractors.
 
Manufacturing
 
Water transmission manufacturing begins with the preparation of engineered drawings of each unique piece of pipe in a project. These drawings are prepared on our proprietary computer-aided design system and are used as blueprints to manufacture pipe. After the drawings are completed and approved, the manufacturing of engineered steel water pipe begins by feeding a steel coil continuously at a specified angle into a spiral weld mill which cold-forms the band into a tubular configuration with a spiral seam. Automated arc welders, positioned on both the inside and the outside of the tube, are used to weld the seam. The welded pipe is then cut at the specified length. After completion of the forming and welding phases, the finished cylinder is tested and inspected in accordance with project specifications, which may include 100% radiographic analysis of the weld seam. The cylinders are then coated and lined as specified. Possible coatings include polyurethane paint, polyethylene tape, epoxies, cement mortar, coal-tar enamel, and Pritec®. The inside of the pipe cylinders can be lined with cement mortar, polyurethane, or epoxies. Following coating and lining, certain pieces may be custom fabricated as required for the project. This process is performed at our on-site fabrication facilities. Typically, completed pipe segments are evaluated for structural integrity with a hydrotester. Upon final inspection, the pipe is prepared for shipment. We ship our products to project sites principally by truck.
 
Technology. Advances in technology help us produce high-quality products at competitive prices. We have invested in modern welding and inspection equipment to improve both productivity and product quality. We own interlocking pipe joining system technologies (Permalok®) that provide an alternate joint solution used for connecting steel pipes. We also own T-Lock® and Arrow-Lock® Sheet Lining Systems that provide long-term protection against corrosion in concrete for both new and rehabilitation projects. The PVC sheet lining material protects against hydrogen sulfide gas, acids, alkalis, salt, and other forms of corrosion in precast concrete pipe, concrete structures, and monolithic tunnels.
 
To stay current with technological developments in the United States and abroad, we participate in trade shows, industry associations, research projects, and vendor trials of new products. Our staff includes some of the most tenured and experienced pipe manufacturing professionals in the nation.

Quality Assurance. We have quality management systems in place that assure we are consistently providing products that meet or exceed customer and applicable regulatory requirements. All of our quality management systems in the United States and Mexico are registered under a multi-site registration either by the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) or the Steel Plate Fabricators Association (“SPFA”). In addition to ISO and SPFA qualifications, we are certified for specific products or operations by the American Institute of Steel Construction, American Concrete Pressure Pipe Association, American Petroleum Institute, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American Society for Nondestructive Testing, American Welding Society, Caltrans, and NSF International. Our Quality Assurance Department is responsible for monitoring and measuring characteristics of product. Inspection capabilities include, but are not limited to, visual, dimensional, liquid penetrant, magnetic particle, hydrostatic, ultrasonic, real-time imaging enhancement, real-time radioscopic, base material tensile, yield and elongation, sand sieve analysis, coal-tar penetration, concrete compression, lining and coating dry film thickness, adhesion, absorption, guided bend, charpy impact, hardness, metallurgical examinations, chemical analysis, spectrographic analysis, and finished product final inspection. Product is not released for customer shipment until there is verification that all product requirements have been met.
Product Liability. The manufacturing and use of our products involves a variety of risks. Certain losses may result, or be alleged to result, from defects in our products, thereby subjecting us to claims for damages including consequential damages. We warrant our products to be free of certain defects for one year. We maintain insurance coverage against potential product liability claims in the amount of $51 million, which we believe to be adequate. Historically, product liability claims against us have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that product liability claims exceeding our insurance coverage will not be experienced in the future or that we will be able to maintain such insurance with adequate coverage.
Backlog
 
We measure backlog as a key metric to evaluate the commercial health of our business. Backlog represents the balance of remaining performance obligations under signed contracts. Binding agreements received by us may be subject to cancelation or postponement; however, cancelation would obligate the customer to pay the contract consideration proportional to the costs we have incurred through the cancelation date. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, backlog was approximately $81 million and $53 million, respectively. Backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual operating results for any fiscal period. There can be no assurance that any amount of backlog ultimately will be realized. Separate from our backlog, we have been notified that we are the successful bidder on additional projects, but binding agreements have not been executed (“confirmed orders”). As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, backlog including confirmed orders, which is the metric we have traditionally reported, was approximately $252 million and $88 million, respectively. Projects for which a binding agreement has not been executed could be canceled.
Competition
 
We have several regional competitors. Most water transmission projects are competitively bid and price competition is vigorous. Price competition may reduce the gross margin on sales, which may adversely affect overall profitability. Other competitive factors include timely delivery, ability to meet customized specifications, and high freight costs which may limit the ability of manufacturers located in other market areas to compete with us.
 
With manufacturing facilities in Oregon, Mexico, California, Texas, West Virginia, and Missouri we believe we can more effectively compete throughout North America. Our primary competitors in the western United States and southwestern Canada are Imperial Pipe and West Coast Pipe. East of the Rocky Mountains, our primary competition includes Thompson Pipe Group, AMERICAN SpiralWeld Pipe Company, LLC, and Mid America Pipe Fabricating & Supply, LLC.
 
No assurance can be given that new or existing competitors will not build new facilities or expand capacity within our market areas. In October 2018, a competitor announced it was building a new spiral-welded steel pipe plant in Texas. New or expanded facilities or new competitors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to capture market share and maintain product pricing.
 
Raw Materials and Supplies
 
The main raw component in our manufacturing process is steel. We have historically purchased hot rolled and galvanized steel coil from both domestic and foreign steel mills; however, in 2018 all steel purchases were from domestic steel mills. Domestic suppliers include Big River Steel, ArcelorMittal USA LLC, Nucor Corporation, Steel Dynamics, Inc., EVRAZ North America, SSAB, California Steel Industries, Inc., and JDM Steel Service, Inc. Steel is normally purchased after project award. From time to time, we may purchase small quantities of additional steel when it is available at favorable prices. Purchased steel represents a substantial portion of our cost of sales. The steel industry is highly cyclical in nature and steel prices fluctuate significantly, influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, availability of raw materials, energy costs, import duties, other trade restrictions and currency exchange rates.
 
We also rely on certain suppliers of coating materials, lining materials, and certain custom fabricated items. We have at least two suppliers for most of our raw materials. We believe our relationships with our suppliers are positive and have no indication that we will experience shortages of raw materials or components essential to our production processes or that we will be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. Any shortages of raw materials may result in production delays and costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulation
 
We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, violations of which could lead to fines, penalties, other civil sanctions, or criminal sanctions. These environmental laws and regulations govern emissions to air; discharges to water (including stormwater); and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste materials. We operate under numerous governmental permits and licenses relating to air emissions, stormwater runoff, and other environmental matters. We are subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at properties we presently own or operate and at third-party disposal or treatment facilities to which these sites send or arrange to send hazardous waste. For example, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at the Portland Harbor Superfund Site discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II — Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 2018 Form 10-K. We believe we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and do not currently believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
 
Estimating liabilities for environmental investigations and cleanup is complex and dependent upon a number of factors beyond our control which may change dramatically. We have no reserves for environmental investigation or cleanup, and we believe this is appropriate based on current information; however, we cannot provide assurance that our future environmental investigation and cleanup costs and liabilities will not result in a material expense.
 
Employees
 
As of January 31, 2019, we had 691 full-time employees; approximately 30% were salaried and approximately 70% were employed on an hourly basis. Approximately 21% of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees and labor unions to be good.
Geographic Information
 
We sold principally all of our products in the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2018, our long-lived assets are located in the United States and Mexico. See Note 6 and Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II — Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 2018 Form 10-K for property and equipment information and revenue by geographic region.
