Item 1. Business
Overview
We help people buy and sell homes. Our primary business is a residential real estate brokerage, representing customers in over 85 markets throughout the United States and Canada. We pair our own agents with our own technology to create a service that is faster, better, and costs less. We meet customers through our listings-search website and mobile application.
We use the same combination of technology and local service to originate mortgage loans and offer title and settlement services; we also buy homes directly from consumers who want an immediate sale, taking responsibility for selling the home while the original owner moves on.
Our mission is to redefine real estate in the consumer’s favor.

Representing Customers
Our brokerage efficiency results in savings that we share with our customers. Our homebuyers saved on average over $2,100 per transaction in 2018. And we charge most home sellers a commission of 1% to 1.5%, compared to the 2.5% to 3% typically charged by traditional brokerages.
The results of our customer-first approach are clear. We:

• | helped customers buy or sell more than 170,000 homes worth more than $85 billion through 2018;


• | drew more than 27 million monthly average visitors to our website and mobile application in 2018, 21% more compared to 2017;


• | earned a net promoter score, which is a measure of customer satisfaction, that was 49% higher than competing brokerages, as measured by a study we commissioned in November 2018;


• | had customers return to us for another transaction at a 58% higher rate than competing brokerages;


• | sold Redfin-listed homes for nearly $2,800 more on average compared to the list price than competing brokerages’ listings in 2018, according to a study we commissioned;


• | had listings on the market for an average of 33 days in 2018 compared to the industry average of 37 days, according to a study we commissioned; and according to the same study approximately 83% of Redfin listings sold within 90 days versus the industry average of approximately 80%; and


• | employed lead agents who, in 2018, were on average three times more productive and earned a median income that was twice as much as agents at competing brokerages; our lead agents were also 24% more likely to stay with us from 2017 to 2018 than agents at competing brokerages.

To serve customers when our own agents can’t due to high demand or geographic limitations, we’ve developed partnerships with over 3,000 agents at other brokerages. Once we refer a customer to a partner agent, that agent, not us, represents the customer from the initial meeting through closing, at which point the agent pays us a portion of her commission as a referral fee.
Complete Customer Solution

Our long-term goal is to combine brokerage, mortgage, title services, and instant offers into one solution, sharing information, coordinating deadlines, and streamlining processes so that a consumer's move is easier and often less costly. As we integrate these services more closely over time, we believe we can help consumers move much more efficiently than a combination of stand-alone brokerages, mortgage lenders, and title companies ever could.
Redfin Mortgage underwrites mortgage loans according to investor guidelines and, after originating each loan, Redfin Mortgage sells the loans to those investors. Redfin Mortgage does not intend to retain or service mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2018, Redfin Mortgage accepted applications from customers in Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.
We offer title and settlement services through Title Forward. As of December 31, 2018, Title Forward operated in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.
We buy homes directly from homeowners and resell them to homebuyers through RedfinNow. Customers who sell through RedfinNow typically get less money for their home than they would listing their home with a real estate agent. However, they get that money faster with less risk and fuss. In July 2018, we expanded our RedfinNow service from an experiment to a long-term customer offering. As of December 31, 2018, we had launched RedfinNow in the metropolitan areas of Inland Empire, Orange County, and San Diego.
Competition
The residential brokerage industry is highly fragmented, with numerous active licensed agents and brokerages, and is evolving rapidly in response to technological advancements, changing customer preferences, and new offerings. We compete primarily against other residential real estate brokerages, which include franchise operations affiliated with national or local brands, and small independent brokerages. We also compete with hybrid residential brokerages, which combine Internet technology and brokerage services, and a growing number of others that operate with non-traditional real estate business models. Competition is particularly intense in some of the densely populated metropolitan markets we serve, as they are dominated by entrenched real estate brokerages and are the primary markets for innovative and well-capitalized new entrants.
We believe we compete primarily based on:

• | access to timely, accurate data about homes for sale;


• | traffic to our website and mobile application, which themselves are subject to competition against real estate data websites that aggregate listings and sell advertising to traditional brokers;


• | the speed and quality of our service, including agent responsiveness and local knowledge;


• | our ability to hire and retain agents who deliver the best customer service;


• | the costs of delivering our service and the price of our service to consumers;


• | consumer awareness of our service and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts;


• | technological innovation; and


• | depth and breadth of local referral networks.

For mortgage origination, we compete with numerous national and local multi-product banks as well as focused mortgage originators. We compete with other providers based primarily on product selection, interest rates, origination fees, and service. 
For title and settlement services, we compete with numerous national and local companies that typically focus solely on these services. We compete primarily on fees and timeliness of service.
Our RedfinNow service competes with real estate companies whose primary service is buying and selling homes, and home rental companies that purchase homes and then rent them. We also compete with divisions of several residential real estate companies and a real estate data website. We compete primarily on the prices we offer customers to buy their homes.
