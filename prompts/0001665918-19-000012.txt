Item 1. | Business

US Foods Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to in this Annual Report as “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “US Foods.” US Foods Holding Corp. conducts all of its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary US Foods, Inc. (“USF”) and its subsidiaries. 
Our Company
We are among America’s great food companies and leading foodservice distributors. Built through organic growth and acquisitions, we trace our roots back over 150 years to a number of heritage companies with rich legacies in food innovation and customer service. These include Monarch Foods (established in 1853), Sexton (1883), PYA (1903), Rykoff (1911) and Kraft Foodservice (1976). US Foodservice was organized as a corporation in Delaware in 1989. In November 2011, we rebranded from “US Foodservice” to “US Foods.” 
Our mission is to be First In Food.  We strive to inspire and empower chefs and foodservice operators to bring great food experiences to consumers. This mission is supported by our strategy of Great Food. Made Easy., which centers on providing our customers a broad and innovative offering of high-quality products, as well as a comprehensive suite of industry-leading e-commerce, technology, and business solutions. We operate as one business with standardized business processes, shared systems infrastructure, and an organizational model that optimizes national scale with local execution, allowing us to manage the business as a single operating segment. We have centralized activities where scale matters and our local field structure focuses on customer facing activities. As we say on our trucks, we are Keeping Kitchens Cooking across America.
We supply approximately 250,000 customer locations nationwide. These customer locations include independently owned single and multi-unit restaurants, regional restaurant concepts, national restaurant chains, hospitals, nursing homes, hotels and motels, country clubs, government and military organizations, colleges and universities, and retail locations. We provide approximately 400,000 fresh, frozen, and dry food stock-keeping units, or SKUs, as well as non-food items, sourced from approximately 5,000 suppliers. Approximately 4,000 sales associates manage customer relationships at local, regional, and national levels. They are supported by sophisticated marketing and category management capabilities, as well as a sales support team that includes world-class chefs and restaurant operations consultants, new business development managers and others that help us provide more comprehensive service to our customers. Our extensive network of 63 distribution facilities and fleet of approximately 6,000 trucks allow us to operate efficiently and provide high levels of customer service. This operating model allows us to leverage our nationwide scale and footprint while executing locally. 
Our Business Strategy
While we serve many customer types, our strategy is primarily focused on independent restaurants, small and regional chains, and healthcare and hospitality customers. Among other factors, their expected growth, mix of product and category purchases, and adoption of value-added solutions make them attractive to us.
We offer innovative products and services that help chefs and operators succeed. Our e-commerce tools and mobile solutions make it easier for customers to do business with us. We execute on these elements of our strategy while delivering on the fundamental requirements that are important to all of our customers. 
Growth from acquisitions remains an important part of our strategy. We believe there remain attractive acquisition opportunities for us that will allow us to grow with our target customer types and generate an attractive return on investment, including from the synergies we may capture from integration. As an example, in July 2018, we announced that we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Services Group of America, Inc. (“SGA”) under which we agreed to acquire SGA’s Food Group of Companies, including Food Services of America, Inc., Systems Services of America, Inc., Amerifresh, Inc., Ameristar Meats, Inc. and Gampac Express, Inc. (collectively, the “SGA Food Group Companies”), for $1.8 billion in cash.  The closing of the acquisition remains subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.

Our Industry
The U.S. foodservice distribution industry has a large number of companies competing in the space, including local, regional, and national distributors. Foodservice distributors typically fall into three categories, representing differences in customer focus, product offering, and supply chain:

• | Broadline distributors which offer a “broad line” of products and services;


• | System distributors which carry products specified for large chains; and


• | Specialized distributors which primarily focus on specific product categories (e.g., meat or produce) or customer types.

A number of adjacent competitors also serve the U.S. foodservice distribution industry, including cash-and-carry retailers, commercial wholesale outlets and warehouse clubs, commercial website outlets, and grocery stores.
There is a high degree of customer overlap, particularly across the broadline, specialized and cash-and-carry categories, as many customers purchase from multiple distributors. Most buying decisions are based on the type of product offered, quality and price, and a distributor’s ability to completely and accurately fill orders and provide timely deliveries. Since switching costs are low, customers can make supplier and distribution channel changes quickly. Existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers. 
We believe, based upon industry trade data, that we are the second largest foodservice distributor in the U.S. by annual sales, with over $24 billion in net sales during fiscal 2018. Given our mix of products and services, we are considered a broadline distributor.
The U.S. foodservice distribution industry is comprised of different customer types of varying sizes, growth profiles, and product and service requirements. 

• | Independent restaurants/small chains and regional chains. Independent restaurants and small and regional chains typically differentiate themselves in the market based on the dining experience they provide to consumers and the quality and diversity of their menu. Many value business solutions that help them attract diners, improve the effectiveness of their menu offering, and drive efficiency in their operations. 


• | Healthcare customers. Healthcare customers generally fall into either acute care (e.g. hospital systems) or senior living (e.g. nursing homes and long-term care facilities). Healthcare customers have complex foodservice needs given their scale, need for menu diversity, and logistics considerations. Food is also not as central to their overall business as it is for a restaurant, but it is a key contributor to patient satisfaction. As a result, some healthcare providers utilize third party contract management companies to operate their foodservice facilities. Many use group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, as intermediaries in order to gain procurement scale. In our experience, healthcare customers purchasing directly, through GPOs, or through contract foodservice operators value strong relationships with their foodservice distributors, particularly those that bring national scale, a broad product offering, and strong transactional and logistics capabilities. 


• | Hospitality customers. Hospitality customers are a diverse group, ranging from large hotel chains and conference centers to local banquet halls, country clubs, casinos, and entertainment and sports complexes. Food is a key contributor to guest satisfaction for these customers, and they value solutions related to menu planning and efficiency improvements in their kitchens and restaurants. With complex foodservice needs, hospitality customers value streamlined purchasing processes and expect high service levels in fulfilling their orders. 


• | National restaurant chains. National chains tend to in-source most activities except distribution, where they often rely on system distributors primarily for freight and logistics. 

In fiscal year 2018, no single customer represented more than 3% of our total customer sales. Sales to our top 50 customers/GPOs represented approximately 44% of our net sales in fiscal year 2018. We have relationships with GPOs that act as agents for their members in negotiating pricing, delivery and other terms. Some customers who are members of GPOs purchase their products directly from us under the terms negotiated by their GPOs. In fiscal year 2018, GPO members accounted for about 26% of our total customer purchases. GPO members are primarily

comprised of customers in the healthcare, hospitality, education, and government/military industries, as well as restaurant chains.
We believe that a broad array of value-added solutions offered by foodservice distributors makes customers more effective and efficient and can help foodservice distributors profitably grow their businesses. These services require distributors to invest in their capabilities, resulting in a higher cost-to-serve. When customers benefit from product and service solutions, they purchase a more attractive and profitable mix of items and tend to have stronger commercial relationships and loyalty.
We believe that the customer types that we target, which include independent restaurants, small and regional chains, and healthcare and hospitality customers, have greater growth prospects and/or benefit from the types of value-added solutions we offer to a greater extent than other customer types.
There are several important dynamics affecting the industry, including:

• | Evolving consumer tastes and preferences. Consumers demand healthy and authentic food alternatives with fewer artificial ingredients, and they value locally harvested and sustainably manufactured products. In addition, many ethnic food offerings are becoming more mainstream as consumers show a greater willingness to try new flavors and cuisines. Changes in consumer preferences create opportunities for new and innovative products and for unique food-away-from-home destinations. This, in turn, is expected to create growth, expand margins, and produce better customer retention opportunities for those distributors with the flexibility to balance national scale and local preferences. We believe foodservice distributors will likely need broader product assortments, extended supplier networks, effective supply chain management capabilities, and strong food safety programs to meet these needs. 


• | Generational shifts with millennials and baby boomers. Given their purchasing power, millennials and baby boomers will continue to significantly influence food consumption and the food-away-from-home market. According to a U.S. Census Bureau survey, there were 83 million individuals born between 1982 and 2000 in the United States. That makes these millennials the largest demographic cohort. We believe they are key to driving growth in the broader U.S. food industry as their disposable income increases. Baby boomers continue to shape the industry as they remain in the workplace longer, which is expected to prolong their contribution to food-away-from-home expenditures. 


• | Growing importance of e-commerce. We see significant future growth in e-commerce and in the adoption of mobile technology solutions by foodservice operators. E-commerce solutions increase customer retention. They also deepen the relationship between foodservice distributors and customers, creating new insights and services that can make both more efficient. We think deeper, technology-enabled relationships with customers will accelerate the adoption of new products and increase customer loyalty. As a result, distributors that have invested in creating these capabilities have a competitive edge. We believe this trend will accelerate, as millennials and Generation Z become key influencers and decision-makers within the industry, particularly at the customer level. We believe foodservice distributors will need to strengthen technology, data analytics, and related capabilities to address these changes. 

We believe that we have the scale, foresight and agility required to proactively address these trends and, in turn, benefit from higher growth, greater customer retention and improved profitability.
Products, Brands, and Other Intellectual Property
We have a broad assortment of product categories and brands to meet customers’ needs. In many categories, we offer products under a spectrum of private brands based on price and quality.

Suppliers

Additionally, regional and local suppliers support targeted geographic initiatives and private label programs requiring regional and local distribution. We generally negotiate supplier agreements on a centralized basis.
Seasonality
Our business does not fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and as a result, is not considered seasonal.

Working Capital
Our operations and strategic objectives require continuing capital investment, and our resources include cash provided by operations, as well as access to capital from bank borrowings and other types of debt and financing arrangements. See discussion in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding our liquidity and capital resources. 
Government Regulation
As a marketer and distributor of food products in the U.S., US Foods must comply with various laws and regulations from certain U.S. federal, state and local regulatory agencies. A summary of some of these laws and regulations is provided below.
Food Handling and Processing
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the manufacturing, handling, storage, transportation, sale and labeling of food products, including the applicable provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, Bioterrorism Act, Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), Federal Meat Inspection Act, Poultry Products Inspection Act, Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, Country of Origin Labeling Act, and regulations issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). 
Our distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections by federal and/or state authorities. We have a small number of processing facilities for some meat, poultry, seafood and produce products.  These units are registered and inspected by the USDA (with respect to meat and poultry) and the FDA (with respect to produce and seafood). 
We also distribute a variety of non-food products, such as food containers, kitchen equipment and cleaning materials, and are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the storage, transportation, distribution, sale and labeling of those non-food products, including requirements to provide information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute.
Our customers include several departments of the U.S. federal government, as well as certain state and local governmental entities. These customer relationships subject us to additional regulations applicable to government contractors.
Employment
The U.S. Department of Labor and its agencies, the Employee Benefits Security Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, regulate our employment practices and standards for workers. We are also subject to laws that prohibit discrimination in employment based on non-merit categories, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other laws relating to accessibility and the removal of barriers. Our workers’ compensation self-insurance is subject to regulation by the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Our facilities are subject to inspections under the Occupational Safety and Health Act with respect to our compliance with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We are also subject to the National Labor Relations Act, which governs the process for collective bargaining between employers and employees and protects the rights of both employers and employees in the workplace.
Trade
For the purchase of products produced, harvested or manufactured outside of the U.S., and for the shipment of products to customers located outside of the U.S., we are subject to applicable customs laws regarding the import and export of various products. Certain activities, including working with customs brokers and freight forwarders, are subject to applicable regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security.

Ground Transportation
The U.S. Department of Transportation and its agencies, the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, regulate our trucking operations through the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. Matters such as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under U.S. federal and state regulations.
Environmental
Our operations are also subject to a broad range of U.S. federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as zoning and building regulations. Environmental laws and regulations cover a variety of procedures, including appropriately managing wastewater and stormwater; complying with clean air laws, including those governing vehicle emissions; properly handling and disposing of solid and hazardous wastes; protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases; and monitoring and maintaining underground and aboveground storage tanks for diesel fuel and other petroleum products.
Anticorruption
Because we are organized under the laws of a state in the U.S. and our principal place of business is in the U.S., we are considered a “domestic concern” under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and are covered by the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit any domestic concern and any officer, director, employee, or agent acting on behalf of the domestic concern from paying or authorizing payment of anything of value to: (i) influence any act or decision by a foreign official; (ii) induce a foreign official to do or omit to do any act in violation of his/her lawful duty; (iii) secure any improper advantage; or (iv) induce a foreign official to use his/her influence to assist the payor in obtaining or retaining business or directing business to another person.
Employees 
As of December 29, 2018, we had approximately 25,000 employees, of which approximately 24,800 were full-time employees. Approximately 4,400 employees were members of local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations. Approximately one-third of our distribution facilities have employees represented by unions with collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”). 
During fiscal year 2018, 11 CBAs covering approximately 900 employees were renegotiated. During fiscal 2019, 15 CBAs covering approximately 1,400 employees will be subject to renegotiation. While we have experienced work stoppages in the past, we generally believe we have good relations with both union and non-union employees, and we believe we are a well-regarded employer in the communities in which we operate.
