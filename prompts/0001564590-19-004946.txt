 The Company operates in two business segments: 
  
• | United States. The U.S. segment is comprised of three reporting units: capital markets; investment markets; and language solutions, which was divested in 2018.* The Company services capital market and investment market clients in the U.S. by delivering products and technology-enabled services to help create, manage and deliver financial communications to investors and regulators.

• | International. The International segment includes operations in Asia, Europe, Canada and Latin America. The international business is primarily focused on working with international capital markets clients on capital markets offerings and regulatory compliance related activities within the United States. In addition, the International segment provides services to international investment market clients to allow them to comply with applicable SEC regulations, as well as language solutions to international clients.*
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *The Company sold its Language Solutions business on July 22, 2018. Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Due to the sale of the Language Solutions business, the Company made changes to the reporting units within the U.S. segment. The former Language Solutions and other reporting unit has been renamed “Language Solutions.” Certain results previously included within the former Language Solutions and other reporting unit are now included within the Investment Markets reporting unit. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to the Company’s current reporting unit structure.
 The Company reports certain unallocated selling, general and administrative activities and associated expenses within “Corporate”, including, in part, executive, legal, finance, marketing and certain facility costs. In addition, certain costs and earnings of employee benefit plans, such as pension income and share-based compensation, are included in Corporate and are not allocated to the reportable segments. Prior to the Separation (as defined below), many of these costs were based on allocations from R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (“RRD”); however, beginning October 1, 2016, the Company incurs such costs directly.

Products and Services
 The Company separately reports its net sales and related cost of sales for its products and services offerings. The Company’s services offerings consist of document composition, compliance related EDGAR filing services, transaction solutions, language solutions, and the Company’s SaaS solutions, including Venue, FundSuiteArc, ActiveDisclosure and EDGAR Online, among others. The Company’s product offerings primarily consist of conventional and digital printed products and related shipping costs. 
Company History
 Spin-off Transaction
 On October 1, 2016, DFIN became an independent publicly traded company through the distribution by RRD of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of DFIN common stock to RRD shareholders (the “Separation”). Holders of RRD common stock received one share of DFIN common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held on September 23, 2016. As part of the Separation, RRD retained approximately 6.2 million shares of DFIN common stock, or a 19.25% interest in DFIN, of which 6.1 million shares and 0.1 million shares were subsequently sold in June 2017 and August 2017, respectively. DFIN’s common stock began regular-way trading under the ticker symbol “DFIN” on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2016.  On October 1, 2016, RRD also completed the previously announced separation of LSC Communications, Inc. (“LSC”), its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business. On March 28, 2017, RRD completed the sale of 6.2 million shares of LSC common stock (RRD’s remaining ownership stake in LSC) in an underwritten public offering. As a result, beginning in the quarter ended June 30, 2017, LSC no longer qualified as a related party of the Company. Beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2017, RRD no longer qualified as a related party, therefore amounts disclosed related to RRD are presented through June 30, 2017 only. 
Language Solutions 
 On July 22, 2018, the Company sold its Language Solutions business. Prior to its sale, the Language Solutions business supported domestic and international businesses in a variety of industries by helping them adapt their business content into different languages for specific countries, markets and regions through a complete suite of language products and services. The Company provided its language solutions offerings to clients operating in a variety of industries, including the financial, corporate, life sciences and legal industries, among others. In 2018, prior to the sale of the Language Solutions business, the Company provided services to companies in 73 different countries.
 eBrevia
 On December 18, 2018, the Company acquired eBrevia, a provider of artificial intelligence-based data extraction and contract analytics software solutions. The Company previously held a 12.8% investment in eBrevia prior to the acquisition. The purchase price for the remaining equity of eBrevia, which includes the Company’s estimate of contingent consideration, was $23.2 million, net of cash acquired of $0.2 million. $4.1 million of the purchase price, excluding contingent consideration and amounts held in escrow, was payable as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be paid during 2019. The eBrevia technology provides enterprise contract review and analysis solutions, leveraging machine learning to produce fast and accurate results. eBrevia's software, which extracts and summarizes key legal provisions and other information, is used in due diligence, contract management, lease abstraction, and document drafting. eBrevia’s operations are included within the Capital Markets reporting unit in the U.S. segment. The acquisition enhances the Company’s Venue Deal Solutions offerings to provide clients with secure data aggregation, due diligence, compliance and risk management solutions. 
 Competition 
 Technological and regulatory changes, including the electronic distribution of documents, continue to impact the market for our products and services. In addition to the Company’s ongoing innovation in its SaaS solutions, one of the Company’s competitive strengths is that it offers a wide array of communications products, compliance services, a global platform, exceptional sales and service and regulatory domain expertise, which provide differentiated solutions for its clients. 
 The global risk and compliance industry, in general, is highly competitive and barriers to entry have decreased as a result of technology innovation.   Despite some consolidation in recent years, the industry remains highly fragmented in the United States and even more so internationally with many in-country alternative providers. The Company expects competition to increase from existing competitors, as well as new and emerging market entrants. In addition, as the Company expands its product and service offerings, it may face competition from new and existing competitors. The Company competes primarily on product quality and functionality, service levels, subject matter regulatory expertise, security, price and reputation.

The impact of digital technologies has impacted many of the products and markets in which the Company competes, most acutely in the Company’s mutual fund, variable annuity and public company compliance business offerings. While the Company offers a high-touch, service oriented experience, technology changes have provided alternatives to the Company’s clients that allow them to manage more of the financial disclosure process themselves.  The Company has invested in its own SaaS solutions, ActiveDisclosure, FundSuiteArc and Venue to serve clients and increase retention and has invested to expand capabilities and address new market sectors. The future impact of technology on the business is difficult to predict and could result in additional expenditures to restructure impacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, the Company has made targeted acquisitions and investments in its existing business to offer clients innovative services and solutions, including acquisitions of eBrevia, EDGAR Online and MultiCorpora and investments in AuditBoard (formerly known as Soxhub), Mediant and Peloton that support the Company’s position as a technology service leader in this evolving industry.  
 The Company’s competitors for SEC filing services for public company compliance clients include full service financial communications providers, technology point solution providers focused on financial communications and general technology providers. The Company’s competitors for SEC filing services for investment markets clients include full service traditional providers, small niche technology providers and local and regional print providers that bid against the Company for printing, mailing and fulfillment services.    Market Volatility/Cyclicality 
 The Company is subject to market volatility in the United States and world economy, as the success of the transactional offering is largely dependent on the global market for IPOs, secondary offerings, mergers and acquisitions, public and private debt offerings, leveraged buyouts, spinouts and other transactions. A variety of factors impact the global markets, including the regulatory and political environment.  Recently, the U.S. IPO market and public debt market were disrupted by the U.S. federal government shutdown that occurred from December 2018 to January 2019.  Future government shutdowns could affect volatility of any of these markets.  The International segment is particularly susceptible to capital market volatility as most of the International business is capital markets transaction focused. The Company mitigates some of that risk by offering services in higher demand during a down market, like document management tools for the bankruptcy/restructuring process, and also by moving upstream from the filing process with products like Venue, the Company’s data room solution. The Company also attempts to balance this volatility through supporting the quarterly/annual public company reporting process through its EDGAR filing services and ActiveDisclosure product, its investment markets regulatory and shareholder communications offering and continues to expand into adjacent growth businesses like data and analytics, which has recurring revenues and is not as susceptible to market volatility and cycles. The quarterly/annual public company reporting process work also subjects the Company to filing seasonality shortly after the end of each fiscal quarter, with peak periods during the course of the year. The seasonality and associated operational implications include the need to increase staff during peak periods through a combined strategy of hiring additional full-time and temporary personnel, increasing the premium time of existing staff, and outsourcing production for a number of services. Additionally, clients and their financial advisors have begun to increasingly rely on web-based services which allow clients to autonomously file and distribute compliance documents with regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. While the Company believes that its ActiveDisclosure and FundSuiteArc solutions are competitive in this space, competitors are continuing to develop technologies that aim to improve clients’ ability to autonomously produce and file documents to meet their regulatory obligations. The Company continues to remain focused on driving recurring revenue to mitigate market volatility.
 Regulatory Impact
 The SEC is adopting new as well as amended rules and forms to modernize the reporting and disclosure of information by registered investment companies. These changes are driving significant regulatory changes which impact the Company’s customers within its Investment Markets business. On October 13, 2016, the SEC adopted a new N-PORT filing requirement, which requires certain registered investment companies to report information about their portfolio in XML, a structured data format, on a monthly basis, replacing what was previously a quarterly filing requirement. This rule also includes an annual N-CEN filing in XML, replacing a semi-annual filing requirement. Compliance dates depend on asset size and began as soon as June 1, 2018 for larger funds, with the first N-PORT filing deadlines beginning in April 2019. The Company’s ArcFiling software solution can support both filings. The Company expects an increase in services revenue due to the increase in the frequency of filings for registered investment companies.
 7


On June 5, 2018, the SEC adopted Rule 30e-3 which provides certain registered investment companies with an option to electronically deliver shareholder reports and other materials rather than providing such reports in paper. Investors who prefer to receive reports in paper will continue to receive them in that format. While Rule 30e-3 was effective January 1, 2019, default electronic distribution pursuant to the rule will begin on January 1, 2021 due to a 24-month transition period, during which registered investment companies must notify investors of the upcoming change in transmission format of shareholder reports. The Company expects a decline in the volume of printed annual and semi-annual shareholder reports in 2021 and beyond as a result of Rule 30e-3. 
 Raw Materials 
 The primary raw materials used in the Company’s printed products are paper and ink. The paper and ink is sourced from a small set of select suppliers to ensure consistent quality that meets the Company’s performance expectations and provides for continuity of supply. The Company believes that the risk of incurring material losses as a result of a shortage in raw materials is unlikely and that the losses, if any, would not have a materially negative impact on the Company’s business. 
Distribution
 The Company’s products are distributed to end-users through the U.S or foreign postal services, through retail channels, electronically or by direct shipment to customer facilities. 
 Customers 
 For each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated and combined net sales. 
 Technology
 The Company invests resources in developing software solutions to complement its services. The Company invests in its core composition systems and client facing solutions and has also adopted market-leading third party systems which have improved the efficiency of its sales and operations processes. The Company has continued to invest in enhancements of its technology-based offerings including EDGAR filing and XBRL services, Venue Virtual Data Room, Venue Deal Solutions, ActiveDisclosure, FundSuiteArc software platform, and its data and analytics solutions. The Company continues to invest in leading and innovative technology such as robotic process automation, machine learning and hybrid cloud architecture.
Cybersecurity & Data Protection
 A core aspect of the Company’s business relies on technology and software; as a result, the security of those technologies and software, as well as the protection of the confidential information entrusted to the Company by its customers, are key parts of the Company’s business and strategy. The DFIN Cybersecurity Program is based upon industry leading frameworks, which include International Standardization Organization #27001 (ISO 27001), Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (commonly known as NIST).  The Company’s technologies and software must also comply with global regulatory and legal requirements such as the European Union’s Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEA), New York State Department of Finance’s 23 NYCRR 500 Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, and other similar regulations.  Ensuring that these technologies and software comply with those regulations is a key focus of the Company’s efforts.
 The Company leverages cybersecurity technologies designed to ensure that client, employee and business confidential data is secure.  The Company’s cybersecurity portfolio is inclusive of, but not limited to, data encryption, data masking, leading secure software development methodologies, aggressive application and network penetration testing, incident response, digital forensics, least-privileged access controls, anti-malware, virtual private networks and cyber threat intelligence.  Additionally, the Company manages a 24x7 Security Operations capability that monitors and responds to cyber threats in real time.
 To demonstrate transparency, the Company’s commitment to effective cybersecurity and data protection efforts and in pursuit of continuous improvement, the Company undergoes a series of third-party security reviews, including third-party penetration tests.

Environmental Compliance 
 It is the Company’s policy to conduct its global operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future. However, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated and combined annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 3,100 employees.
