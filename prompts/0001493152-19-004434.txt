ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History
 
We were incorporated on October 17, 2017 in the State of Delaware as a blank check company to be used as a vehicle to pursue a business combination with an unidentified target. Since inception, and prior to the Merger (as defined below), we only engaged in organizational efforts. Following the Merger, we discontinued our prior activities of seeking a business for a merger or acquisition and acquired the business of John Keeler & Co., Inc., d/b/a Blue Star Foods, a Florida corporation formed on May 5, 1995 (“Keeler & Co”).
 
On November 8, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), we consummated a merger (the “Merger”) pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Blue Star Acquisition Corp., a newly formed, wholly-owned Florida subsidiary of the Company (“Acquisition Sub”), Keeler & Co, and John Keeler, Keeler & Co’s sole stockholder (the “Keeler & Co Stockholder”). As a result of the Merger, effective as of November 8, 2018, Acquisition Sub merged with and into Keeler & Co, and Keeler & Co became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
In connection with the Merger, the Company changed its name from “AG Acquisition Group II, Inc.” to “Blue Star Foods Corp.” and succeeded to the business of Keeler & Co, an international seafood company that imports, packages and sells refrigerated pasteurized crab meat, and other premium seafood products, including crab cakes, finfish and wakami salad, as its sole line of business.
 
At the Closing Date, each of the 500 shares of Keeler & Co’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger was exchanged for 30,000 shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Common Stock”). As a result, an aggregate of 15,000,000 shares of our Common Stock were issued to the Keeler & Co Stockholder.
 
Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, we held an initial closing of our private placement offering (the “Offering”) of a minimum of $700,000 and a maximum of $3,200,000 of units of our securities (the “Units”), in which we sold 725 Units at a purchase price of $1,000 per Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of $725,000. Each Unit consisted of one share of the Company’s 8% Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series A Stock”), initially convertible into shares (the “Conversion Shares”) of the Company’s Common Stock, at a conversion rate of $2.00 per share, and (ii) a three-year warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock for every share of Common Stock that would be received upon conversion of a share of Series A Stock (the “Warrant Shares”), at an exercise price equal to $2.40.
 
On November 8, 2018, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the investors in the Offering. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, within 120 business days after the closing of the Offering, the Company is obligated toll file a registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) with the SEC covering the Conversion Shares and the Warrant Shares (collectively, the “Registrable Shares”) and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective and to keep such Registration Statement effective for a period of twelve months or for such shorter period ending on the earlier to occur of (x) the sale of all Registrable Securities and (y) the availability of Rule 144 for the sale of the Registrable Securities without volume limitations within a 90 day period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the SEC limits the number of Registrable Securities that may be sold pursuant to the Registration Statement, the Company may remove from the Registration Statement such number of Registrable Securities as specified by the SEC on a pro-rata basis (the “SEC Cutback”). The holders of Registrable Shares will have “piggyback” registration rights for such Registrable Shares with respect to two registration statements in accordance with the terms and the notice requirements of the Registration Rights Agreement, subject to a SEC Cutback or a customary cutback in an underwritten offering, both which would be pro rata.
 
Effective upon the closing of the Merger, we issued an aggregate of 688 Units to eleven individuals and entities (the “Settlement Parties”) in consideration for each such individual or entity entering into a settlement and mutual general release agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with the Company in full and complete settlement and satisfaction and release of claims such Settlement Parties may have against the Company (the “Company Settlement”).

Also, in connection with the Merger, the Company redeemed an aggregate of 9,250,000 shares of Common Stock from the Company’s pre-Merger stockholders (the “Pre-Merger Holders”) for cancellation by the Company (the “Share Redemption”). The Pre-Merger Holders retained an aggregate of 750,000 shares of our Common Stock after the Merger. The shares were surrendered in consideration for the direct benefit the Pre-Merger Holders will receive in connection with the consummation of the Merger.
 
Our authorized capital stock currently consists of 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock, and 5,000,000 shares of the preferred stock, of which 10,000 shares have been designated as Series A Stock. Our Common Stock is not traded on any exchange or quoted on the OTC Markets, and there is no public market for our Common Stock.
 
Company Overview
 
We are an international seafood company that imports, packages and sells refrigerated pasteurized crab meat, and other premium seafood products. Our current source of revenue is from importing blue and red swimming crab meat primarily from Indonesia, Philippines and China and distributing it in the United States, Canada and Europe under several premium brand names such as Blue Star, Oceanica, Pacifika, Crab & Go and Harbor Banks. Our products are also sold in Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, the European Union, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Hong Kong. The crab meat which we import is processed in 14 plants throughout Southeast Asia. Our suppliers are primarily via co-packing relationships, including two affiliated suppliers. We sell primarily to food service distributors. We also sell our products to wholesalers, retail establishments and seafood distributors. See “Description of Business” below.
 
Our premium proprietary brands are differentiated in terms of quality and price point.
 
We believe that we utilize best-in-class technology, in both resource sustainability management and ecological packaging.
 
The Company’s executive offices and warehouse facility are based in Miami, Florida Additionally, the Company may, from time to time, utilize third party warehouses located in Miami, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
 
Strategy
 
Our strategy is to create a vertically integrated seafood company that offers customers high quality products while maintaining a focus on our core values of delivering food safety, traceability and certified sustainability.
 
We plan to grow the Company organically by continuing to grow our customer base, offering additional species to our customers, introducing new value-added product lines and strategically acquiring companies that we believe we can integrate into a larger, vertically integrated company.
 
Competitive Strengths -Sustainable and Traceable Product Sourcing
 
We believe that our greatest point of differentiation from other seafood companies are our efforts to ensure that our seafood products are ethically sourced in a method that is consistent with our core values and those of our customers.
 
We purchase the majority of our crab product from processors which source the crab meat from local fishermen in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and India, to whom we pay a premium in order to outfit their boats with a proprietary GPS-based system. This system allows us to trace where the crab product originates and ensure that only mature crabs are being harvested by the use of collapsible traps and not gill nets.
 
We have created a technology platform that tracks the product through its entire chain of custody and collects and transmits various data to the Company in real-time, from the loading site, to the packing plant, through the sorting and pasteurization process and the exporting process to the end customer. Our technology allows our customers access to their “Scan on Demand” QR code-enabled traceability application.

The crab meat is purchased directly from processors with whom we have long-standing relationships, that have agreed to source their product in a sustainable manner. All crab meat is sourced under the Company’s FDA approved Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (“HACCP”) Plan. Additionally, all suppliers are certified by the British Retail Consortium (the “BRC”) and are audited annually to ensure safety and quality of our product.
 
Our warehouse facility in Miami, Florida is the only crab meat facility audited by the BRC in the U.S.
 
Proprietary Brands. We have created several brands of crab meat that are well regarded amongst our customers and are differentiated by product quality and price point.
 

● | Blue Star is packed with only high quality Portunus Pelagicus species crab and is produced under exacting specifications and quality control requirements. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pacifika is a quality brand for the price conscious end-user. The Portunus Haanii crab meat is packed in China and is ideal for upscale plate presentations. 
● | Oceanica is made from the Portunus Haanii crab, which is caught and processed in Vietnam. It is an affordable choice to help reduce food cost without sacrificing the look / taste of dishes. 
● | Crab + Go Premium Seafood is geared towards millennials as part of the trend toward prepackaged grab and go items. The product is packaged in flexible foil pouches. 

 
Eco-Friendly Packaging. Another major point of differentiation from our competitors is our use of sustainable and ethical packaging. Our green pouches for Eco-Fresh crab meat are patented in the United States, Europe, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia under patent Nos.1526091 B1 and US Patents 8,337,922 and 8,445,046. Since their introduction in 2003, these pouches have saved in excess of 800 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions versus metal can packaging material.
 
Competition
 
In general, the international seafood industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with local and overseas manufacturers and importers engaged in similar products.
 
The Company’s primary competitors are Tri Union Frozen Products, Inc. (Chicken of the Sea Frozen Foods), Phillips Foods, Inc., Harbor Seafood, Inc., Bonamar Corporation and Twin Tails Seafood Corp.
 
Industry Overview
 
The international seafood industry is going through a period of rapid change as it strives to meet the needs of a growing population around the world, where food consumption habits are evolving. We believe there are powerful trends emerging in the developing world (including a growing demand for animal-based protein) as well as and in the developed world (where there is an increased awareness and focus on sustainable sourcing and protecting marine ecosystems).
Population Growth and Global Seafood Consumption
 

● | The United Nations estimates that there will be close to 9.8 billion people on our planet by the year 2050(1), a significant increase from the existing population estimates of 7.6 billion. (1) 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seafood Industry Participants
 

● | The mix of parties involved in seafood varies from the local village fisherman, to large, international, vertically-integrated seafood companies. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The total number of fishing vessels in the world in 2014 is estimated at about 4.6 million, with the fleet in Asia being the largest, consisting of 3.5 million vessels and accounting for 75 percent of the global fleet, followed by Africa (15%), Latin America and the Caribbean (6%), North America (2%) and Europe (2%) (5).

Growth Strategy
 
We intend to grow the business organically and through strategic acquisitions.
 
Organic growth – We believe that allocating additional capital to our existing business plan will allow us to continue to meet growing demand from end-customers for seafood products. The Company also currently intends to introduce new species, including lobster tails, fin fish and other specialty seafood proteins in the next 18 months.
 
Acquisitions –We also currently intend to evaluate strategic acquisitions in the fragmented seafood industry. We believe that such potential acquisitions may add value in several ways, including geographical diversification and new specifies offerings, as well as operational and price synergies.
 
Products
 
We currently have four products: Blue Star, Pacifika, Oceanica, and Crab & Go Premium Seafood.
 
Blue Star is packed with only high quality Portunus Pelagicus species crab and is produced under exacting specifications and quality control requirements.
 
Pacifika is a quality brand for the price conscious end-user. The Portunus Haanii crab meat is packed in China and is ideal for upscale plate presentations.
 
Oceanica is made from the Portunus Haanii crab, which is caught and processed in Vietnam. It is an affordable choice to help reduce food cost without sacrificing the look / taste of dishes.

Grab + Go Premium Seafood is geared towards millennials as part of the trend toward pre-packaged, grab-and-go items. The product is packaged in flexible foil pouches.
 
Suppliers
 
We purchase crab meat directly from 14 processors with which we have long-standing relationships, that have agreed to source their product in a sustainable manner. All crab meat is sourced under the Company’s FDA approved HACCP Plan. Additionally, all suppliers are certified by the BRC and are audited annually to ensure safety and quality.
 
The Company has two suppliers which accounted for approximately 76% of the Company’s total purchases during the year ended December 31, 2018. These two suppliers are located in Indonesia and the Philippines, which accounted for approximately 93% of the Company’s total purchases during 2018. These suppliers included Bacolod Blue Star Export Corp. (“Bacolod”), an affiliated party based in the Philippines, which accounted for approximately 49% of the Company’s total purchases during 2018. Five non-affiliated suppliers, PT Siger Jaya Abadi of Indonesia, PT Blue Star Anugrah of Indonesia, PT Bumi Menara Interusa of Indonesia, PT Nuansa Cipta Magello and PT Muria Bahari Indonesia made up the balance of the 44% of the supply concentration.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
The Company’s products can be found in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the European Union, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Hong Kong. Its primary current source of revenue is importing blue and red swimming crab meat primarily from Indonesia, Philippines and China and distributing it in the United States, Canada and Europe under several brand names such as Blue Star, Oceanica, Pacifika and Harbor Banks.
 
The Company has a sales team of four employees based throughout the U.S. who sell directly to customers most of whom are in the food service and retail industry and also manage a network of nine regional and national brokers, that cover both the retail and wholesale segments. The sales team and brokers help to pull the products through the system by creating demand at the end user level and pulling the demand through our distributor customers. We sell to retail customers either directly or via distributors that specialize in the retail segment.
 
The Company does not own its own fleet of trucks and utilizes “LTL” national freight carriers to deliver its products to its customers. Less than truckload freight shipping (“LTL”) is used for the transportation of small freight or when freight does not require the use of an entire trailer. When shipping LTL, we pay for a portion of a standard truck trailer, and other shippers and their shipments fill the unoccupied space.
 
Our Technology
 
We have created a technology platform that tracks the product through its entire chain of custody and collects and transmits various data to the Company in real-time, from the loading site, to the packing plant, through the sorting and pasteurization process and the exporting process to the end customer. Our technology allows our customers access to their “Scan on Demand” QR code-enabled traceability application.
Customers
 
Our customer base is comprised of some of the largest companies in the food service and retail industry. We sell our crab meat to our customers through purchase orders. Currently, almost 63% of our revenue is derived from fortune 500 customers. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, sales to food distributors accounted for 57% of our revenue, sales to large buying cooperatives accounted for 11% of our revenue, and sales to retail and wholesale clubs accounting for 11% of our revenue. The balance of our revenue derived from smaller seafood distributors and value-added processors.
 
Our sales are diversified geographically throughout the United States, with Florida being the largest geographic concentration at 17% of sales. As typical in the seafood industry, a large portion of our revenue is located along the eastern seaboard with 42% of our revenue derived from sales to customers along the East Coast from Massachusetts to Florida. International sales directly or through our affiliate in the United Kingdom, Strike the Gold Foods, Ltd. make up roughly 3% of revenue.

The Company had three customers which accounted for approximately 65% of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. Outstanding receivables from these customers accounted for approximately 67% of the total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018. The loss of any major customer could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Government Regulation
 
Our distribution facility in Florida and our international suppliers are certified in accordance with the HACCP, standards for exporting aquatic products to the United States. The HACCP standards are developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), pursuant to the FDA’s HACCP regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, part 123, and are used by the FDA to help ensure food safety and control sanitary standards.
Food Safety and Labeling
 
We are subject to extensive regulation, including, among other things, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. FSMA was enacted in order to aid the effective prevention of food safety issues in the food supply. This comprehensive and evolving regulatory program will impact how food is grown, packed, processed, shipped and imported into the United States and will govern compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“GMPs”). The FDA has finalized seven major rules to implement FSMA, recognizing that ensuring the safety of the food supply is a shared responsibility among many different points in the global supply chain. The FSMA rules are designed to make clear specific actions that must be taken at each of these points to prevent contamination. Some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or seizures, and criminal sanctions, any of which could impact our results of operations.
 
In addition, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on the labels of food products.
 
Our operations and products are also subject to state and local regulation, including the registration and licensing of plants, enforcement by state health agencies of various state standards, and the registration and inspection of facilities. Compliance with federal, state and local regulation is costly and time-consuming. Enforcement actions for violations of federal, state, and local regulations may include seizure and condemnation of products, cease and desist orders, injunctions or monetary penalties. We believe that our practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations.

Trade
 
For the purchase of products harvested or manufactured outside of the United States, and for the shipment of products to customers located outside of the United States, we are subject to customs laws regarding the import and export of shipments. Our activities, including working with customs brokers and freight forwarders, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security.
Federal Trade Commission
 
We are subject to certain regulations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Advertising of our products is subject to such regulation pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
Employee Safety Regulations
 
We are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health, and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents.
Anticorruption
 
Because we are organized under the laws of a state in the U.S. and our principal place of business is in the U.S., we are considered a “domestic concern” under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and are covered by the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit any domestic concern and any officer, director, employee, or agent, acting on behalf of the domestic concern from paying or authorizing payment of anything of value to (i) influence any act or decision by a foreign official; (ii) induce a foreign official to do or omit to do any act in violation of his/her lawful duty; (iii) secure any improper advantage; or (iv) induce a foreign official to use his/her influence to assist the payor in obtaining or retaining business, or directing business to another person.
Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of federal, state, and local laws and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public. These requirements relate to a broad range of our activities, including: the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; the identification, generation, storage, handling, transportation, disposal, recordkeeping, labeling, and reporting of, and emergency response in connection with, hazardous materials (including asbestos) associated with our operations; noise emissions from our facilities; and safety and health standards, practices, and procedures that apply to the workplace and the operation of our facilities. Insurance
 
We maintain general liability and product liability, property, worker’s compensation and business interruption insurance and are in the process of obtaining director and officer insurance in amounts and on terms that we believe are customary for companies similarly situated. In addition, we maintain excess insurance where we believe it is reasonably cost effective.
 
Employees
 
As of March 29, 2019, we have sixteen full time employees and one part-time employee. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.
