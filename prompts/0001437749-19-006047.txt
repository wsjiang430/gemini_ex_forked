When we refer in this report to “BioLargo,” the “company,” “our company,” “we,” “us” and “our,” we mean BioLargo, Inc., and our subsidiaries, including BioLargo Life Technologies, Inc., which holds our intellectual property; Odor-No-More, Inc., which manufactures, markets, sells and distributes our odor and volatile organic compound control products; our Canadian subsidiary BioLargo Water, Inc., which develops and markets our AOS water treatment technologies; BioLargo Engineering, Science & Technologies, LLC, a professional engineering services division; and BioLargo Development Corp., which employs and provides benefits to our employees. We also own approximately 42% of Clyra Medical Technologies, Inc. (“Clyra Medical”), an entity we formed to commercialize our technologies in the medical and dental fields.
 
The information contained in this Annual Report is as of December 31, 2018, unless expressly stated otherwise.
 
Our Business- A Sustainable Products and Technology Developer
 
BioLargo, Inc. is an innovative technology developer and environmental engineering company driven by a mission to “make life better” by delivering robust, sustainable solutions for a broad range of industries and applications, with a focus on clean water, clean air, and advanced wound care. We develop and commercialize disruptive technologies by providing the capital, support, and expertise to expedite them from “cradle” to “maturity”. Our business strategy is straightforward: we invent or acquire technologies that we believe have the potential to be disruptive in large commercial markets; we incubate and develop these technologies to advance them and promote their commercial success as we leverage our considerable scientific, engineering, and entrepreneurial talent; we then monetize these technical assets through a variety of business structures that may include licensure, joint venture, sale, spin off, or by deploying direct to market strategies. We seek to unlock the value of our portfolio of underlying technologies to both advance our purposeful mission while we create value for our stockholders.
 
Our first significant commercial success is currently unfolding in our subsidiary, Odor-No-More, Inc., which is focused on odor and volatile organic compound (“VOC”) control products sold under the brands CupriDyne Clean and Nature’s Best Science. We are gearing up for rapid growth as our products are experiencing more widespread market adoption in the waste handling industry through national purchasing agreements with four of the largest industry members. To this end, we have recently begun to offer a menu of services to our clients including engineering design, construction, and installation of misting systems and related equipment used to deliver our liquid chemistry products, as well as ongoing maintenance services for installed systems.  We have also begun expanding with early adopters into new vertical segments such as wastewater treatment, the cannabis industry and various industrial facilities like steel manufacturing and livestock processing operations.
 
Our second commercial operation, BioLargo Engineering, Science & Technologies, LLC (“BLEST”), provides professional engineering and consulting services to third party clients on a fee-for-service basis, and also serves as our in-house engineering team to advance our proprietary technologies and complement service offerings of our other business segments.
 
In addition to our two operating subsidiaries, we have technologies and products in the development pipeline progressing towards commercialization, including our water treatment system for decontamination and disinfection (our “Advanced Oxidation System”, or “AOS”) that we target to have commercially ready in 2019, and our medical products focused on healing chronic wounds, which will be ready for commercialization as soon as we pass Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) clearance. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we purchased a stem cell therapy called the SkinDiscTM technology which is focused on regenerative tissue management and is licensed to our subsidiary Clyra Medical Technologies, Inc. (“Clyra Medical”).
 
We believe our current success with our industrial odor and VOC control products serves to validate our overall business strategy which is focused on technology-based products and services capable of disrupting the status quo in their applicable industry market segment. We believe that the future of our medical and clean water technologies has similar and also very large market opportunities ahead as they are introduced commercially.
 
Odor-No-More Industrial Odor and VOC Solutions
 
Our CupriDyne Clean industrial products reduce and eliminate tough odors and VOC’s in various industrial settings, delivered through misting systems, sprayers, water trucks and similar water delivery systems. We believe the product is the number one performing odor-control product in the market, and offers substantial savings to our customers compared with competing products.

Market Opportunity and Disruption Validated
 
Our customer base for our odor and VOC business is expanding. We are now selling product to four of the largest solid waste handling companies in the country, and also have secured multiple flagship clients in the wastewater treatment industry, which we expect to become a priority market. We are also expanding with early adopters into new industrial markets, including steel manufacturing, paper production, construction, building and facilities management, livestock production, the cannabis industry. Opportunities for our products are available internationally. To that end, we participated in the China InnoStars Semi Finals competition in China in early November, gaining exposure for both our company and our products to stakeholders in China’s air quality and odor control market as well as potential strategic investors.  We have in the past and plan to continue marketing these products through industry associations like the “Technology Approval Group” program offered by Isle Utilities that serves the wastewater treatment industry. We also have a number of potential partners actively engaged in commercial trials around the globe and we are actively in discussion with a number of groups to leverage our commercial focus through distribution partnerships.
 

Many of our customers have adopted CupriDyne Clean as a replacement for a non-performing competitive products, some of which have been in use by customers for as many as 30 years. Upon using CupriDyne Clean, the majority of customers have expressed a very high degree of satisfaction with its performance compared to prior solutions. Because of this, we are realizing systematic adoption by our very large corporate customers and expect to serve these customers for years to come. Our experience has helped refine our value proposition and assemble a comprehensive menu of products and services. Our success in this market has validated the market opportunity for our products and services and encourages us to continue investing in infrastructure and sales and marketing to increase revenues. We estimate there are approximately 2,000 active landfills1, 8,000 transfer stations2, and 15,000 waste water treatment agencies3 in the United States. While all may not have ongoing odor problems or neighbor complaints, we believe many of the facilities have need for a disruptive odor solution like CupriDyne Clean.
 
The total addressable market for the waste handling and wastewater treatment industries is greater than $1.3 billion.  While we are still assessing the size of the cannabis, agriculture and steel manufacturing industries, we believe they could readily double the market opportunities for our product CupriDyne Clean.
 
Turn-key Full-service Solutions
 
At the request of our clients, we have begun offering a menu of services to landfills, transfer stations, and wastewater treatment facilities. These services include ongoing maintenance and on-site support services to assist our clients in the design and continued use of the various systems that deliver our liquid products in the field (such as misting systems). We have recently expanded these serves to engineering design, construction and installation. Our engineering team at BLEST has been instrumental in supporting these operations. During late 2018 we were awarded and completed more than 15 projects and we currently have more than 10 “design build” bids out to clients for CupriDyne Clean delivery systems.

Regional Adoption
 
Sales of our CupriDyne Clean products and related services were initially made at the local level, on a per-location/facility basis. We would demonstrate our product to the manager of operations at a transfer station or landfill, and he or she ultimately would decide whether to use our products. If owned by a national company, in some instances before the operations manager could buy our products, we were required to obtain official “vendor” status with the company and sign a “national purchasing agreement” (“NPA”). Doing so required a tremendous amount of effort and time. These agreements typically include the addition of our line of products which will be offered through an online purchasing portal to the members around the nation. The process of integrating the data is often delayed by months from the start date of our agreements given their very technical nature. As an example, we just completed work to finish this portion of the startup process with our fourth national agreement account. These processes establish an easy and familiar selling and purchasing process for the ongoing and long-term relationships we seek to develop. We now have NPAs with four of the largest solid waste handling companies in the United States. Some of these accounts are now introducing us to regional managers around the country who have the ability to direct the facilities in their region to use our product. Because of our continued success with our existing clients, our national accounts are expanding their support for, and expanding resources to encourage increased awareness and broad adoption of our products and services. It is also important to note that we are often replacing companies that have served these customers for 20 to 30 years giving support for our claim of ‘disruption’ to an industry.
 
We believe that “regional adoption” is a scalable approach for the larger solid waste handling companies that, with sufficient resources, we can implement nationwide. Our current national accounts represent the opportunity to serve more than 3,000 local operations around North America. Because of our success serving the transfer stations, material transfer facilities, and landfills, these very large companies are also evaluating the use of CupriDyne Clean in various transportation segments as well.
 
Emerging High-Growth Opportunity in Cannabis Industry 
 
We recently established a working relationship with a company with decades of experience in air handling and air quality management for various industries, including the rapidly expanding cannabis industry. The cannabis industry is facing increased scrutiny by regulators to better control of hazardous air pollutants called terpenes that are a natural part of production and processing. These gases can also cause malodors that demand attention and can be problematic as these companies seek to maintain good community relations and avoid legal entanglements or law suits over nuisance odors. Odor abatement operating procedures are part and parcel to the permitting processes for companies involved in the industry. We have been able to successfully demonstrate that our products are effective as eliminating these VOC’s and related odors, just as we have done in the waste handling industry. As a result, we have had a number of experts in the cannabis industry tell us that our products could become part of the ‘best practices’ operating procedures for this industry and are working toward that goal.
 
The global legal cannabis market is expected to grow to $146.4B in 2025 at an astounding 34.6% annual growth rate. Some call cannabis the 21st century’s gold rush. With an estimated 15,000 companies operating in our California alone, we believe the opportunity for our product is significant. To that end, we are organizing a series of strategic relationships within the Cannabis industry to capture the opportunity quickly. We are working to finalize agreements with equipment manufacturers, regulatory consultants, key opinion leaders, and marketing partners.  Our value proposition is unmatched for odor and VOC control and this is another great example how our platform continues to expand in high value markets. 
 
Wastewater Treatment 
 
We have begun selling products and services to wastewater treatment facilities in our local markets. Our clients are prominent municipal agencies and have indicated a desire to expand the use of our products and services to additional locations in their service areas. As a result of our success in the field, a client featured our product as an example of ‘Best Practices’ for the waste water treatment industry at a national water quality conference hosted by the Water Environment Federation. We anticipate overall longer selling cycles given the technical sophistication of the customers in this market, and believe that channel partnerships with leading companies that already sell and service this highly technical market will be required for our ultimate success. We are highly encouraged and are evaluating various strategies to maximize our marketing and selling proposition into this mature and well-established market. We are actively engaged in discussions with potential distribution partners and leading engineering firms with well established relationships to the clients in order to service this very large market.

Infrastructure and Capital Needs for Odor-No-More
 
We recognize the scope of the opportunity for CupriDyne Clean and related services, and understand the task of building the personnel and infrastructure to become a disruptive company in the waste handling industry. In the United States, we currently operate out of two locations – Southern California and Tennessee. As of now, our manufacturing facilities are located in California. However, we expect to expand our manufacturing and staffing in our Tennessee operation as we achieve critical mass in that region. In the meantime, as a result of the rapid adoption we are experiencing in our local Southern California market, we are focused on adding staff and infrastructure to meet the obvious need for our products and services. Since January 1, 2018, we have added five people in both sales and support roles.
 
We believe that a significant number of personnel will be required to fully service the solid waste handling and wastewater treatment industries. We plan to expand as adequate capital to fund these needs becomes available.
 
Consumer Products – an untapped market opportunity for distribution partnerships
 
Prior to our current success in the industrial odor and VOC control markets, we invested a number of years developing our odor control products, learning the odor control business, winning a series of product design awards, refining our products, developing manufacturing techniques, as well marketing a series of consumer products. We executed licenses for these products into the pet industry and sports equipment industry. However, our licensing partners did not invest resources as promised and they did not produce meaningful financial success. The results were highly disappointing. We chose to shift our focus on the business-to-business sector and pivoted into the industrial odor control sector. Since we made the pivot, we have enjoyed meaningful success as we have secured the leading companies in the world as customers and opportunities are expanding.
 
However, the opportunity in the consumer product market is certainly not dead. Success in the industrial sector has given rise to an increased awareness and acceptance of our consumer products designs because the products are simply more effective than competing products and they are easy and safe to use. We believe that our consumer product designs will ultimately find market adoption through partnerships.   We are not focusing time and money in this consumer market sector, but from time to time, we receive inquiries from groups expressing interest for potential licensing opportunities or distribution partnerships. Recently, one such opportunity presented itself with an entrepreneurial company that offered to develop a series of marketing programs designed to build a retail base of customers in exchange for a commission on each sale.  They are actively building an online presence for our products and have recently placed our DeodorAll branded odor and stain remover for sale on Amazon.com to test market, and have begun methodically building our online presence. It is early in this process and we are optimistic that the product will find a market in the consumer markets as our partner invests time and money building the selling and marketing channel.
 
Full Service Environmental Engineering
 
In September 2017 we formed a subsidiary for the purpose of offering full service environmental engineering to third parties, and to provide engineering support services to our internal teams to accelerate the commercialization of our AOS technologies. Its website is found at www.BioLargoEngineering.com.
 
The subsidiary, BioLargo Engineering, Science & Technologies, LLC (“BLEST”), opened its office in Oak Ridge (a suburb of Knoxville Tennessee), and entered into employment agreements with seven scientists and engineers who collectively have over two hundred years of experience in diverse engineering fields. The team is led by Randall Moore, who served as Manager of Operations for Consulting and Engineering for the Knoxville office of CB&I Environmental & Infrastructure and was formerly a leader at The Shaw Group, Inc., a Fortune 500 global engineering firm. The other team members are also former employees of CB&I and Shaw. The team is highly experienced across multiple industries and they are considered experts in their respective fields, including chemical engineering, wastewater treatment (including design, operations, data gathering and data evaluation), process safety, energy efficiency, air pollution, design and control, technology evaluation, technology integration, air quality management & testing, engineering management, permitting, industrial hygiene, applied research and development, air testing, environmental permitting, HAZOP review, chemical processing, thermal design, computational fluid dynamics, mechanical engineering, mechanical design, NEPDES permitting, RCRA/TSCA compliance and permitting,  project management, storm water design & permitting, computer assisted design (CAD), bench chemistry, continuous emission monitoring system operator, data handling and evaluation and decommissioning and decontamination of radiological and chemical contaminated facilities.

Our engineering team has focused its efforts in two areas. First, servicing third party clients in similar roles as to what they did at CB&I and Shaw, and throughout their well-established careers. Second, they are working to scale-up, engineer and commercialize our AOS water treatment technologies, as well as support other technology and product development efforts within the BioLargo family of companies, including our industrial odor control solutions (CupriDyne Clean). BLEST will also pursue new inventions and be available to provide engineering support where needed for any commercial opportunities that are presented by and through any and all operating units of BioLargo.
 
Business Development at BLEST
 
The selling cycle for BLEST to new outside clients can be anywhere from a few months up to nine months or longer. The nature of their work with outside clients is highly constrained by relationships, reputation, budgeting, bidding and client timing. In light of the long selling cycle that is prevalent in this industry, we are highly encouraged by the most recent developments that have taken months to mature and now appear to be well in process to begin generating financial results. A few noteworthy examples are:
 
During the first quarter of 2018, BLEST secured a new relationship and was retained to serve as “Owner’s Engineer” for a proposed $687 million integrated biofuels production project to be built on the east coast. The proposed facility would convert hundreds of tons per day of municipal solid wastes and plastics into high-grade fuels and paraffin waxes, while diverting hundreds of thousands of tons of waste from landfills per year. Our team’s initial role in this project is to provide the project’s ownership team with consulting engineering support as the project becomes finalized. BLEST is now under contract to be paid for approximately $195,000 of engineering services rendered for the pre-project phase. We expect our role to expand once the client acquires a final piece of real property necessary for the project and additional funding. Assuming it moves ahead, we anticipate that the scope of our services will significantly expand to an important multi-year role in the project’s overall engineering management. We believe this project will require rapid and detailed response and require that we increase of our Oak Ridge staff to fully meet the demands of the project.
 
BLEST has recently secured a time and materials contract to perform a compliance review of a leading natural gas utility in Tennessee’s operating, maintenance, and emergency response activities, and to ensure the overall integrity of the facilities review relating to new rules established by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PMMSA) regulation pertaining to the use of natural underground storage of national gas. The BLEST effort will involve preparing a program implementation plan, conducting a risk assessment, and preparing operational and maintenance procedures to prevent and mitigate facility natural gas leaks and failures caused by corrosion, chemical damage, mechanical damage, or other material deficiencies in piping, tubing, casing, valves, and associated facilities. The work to date on this project has exceeded $20,000 and will continue into the third calendar quarter of 2019. This work is in addition to the annual environmental services contract that averages just over $20,000 per year.
 
BLEST has recently been notified that as a result of its recent audit work on assisting a leading healthcare products company in transitioning to the 2015 revision of the ISO 14001 standard for environmental management systems (EMS) it is being awarded another small project from the client. The new time and materials project involved preparing a detailed GAP analysis, and subsequently updating the client’s EMS procedures to reflect the significant changes to the new EMS standard which places new emphasis on upper management involvement, the life cycle of products and services, emergency preparedness and response, and sustainability. There is also a new focus on evaluating risks and opportunities and integrating this assessment into the EMS program.

BLEST recently began a time and materials contract of work approaching $100,000 to plan and test to demonstrate that emissions from an energetic materials incinerator at a large U.S. military installation on the East coast are meeting EPA regulatory standards. An “energetic materials incinerator” allows the military to safely dispose propellants, explosives, and munitions that have aged beyond their shelf life. This facility must meet numerous emission standards including regulations that limit emissions of chemical compounds called “dioxins” and “furans”, which are tightly regulated chemicals in nearly every developed country. BLEST, having submitted the draft report for the dioxin test, has been awarded a contract for 2019 to prepare a test plan for the 2020 trial burn of the incineration system at the site. This effort combined with a contract to conduct an environmental audit and conduct training of site personnel will exceed $30,000 for calendar 2019. The anticipated contract for the 2020 test, to be awarded January/February of 2020 will exceed $300,000.
 
BLEST has now performed seven separate projects for HAVCO Wood Products, totaling over $35,000 with two additional projects scheduled for 1st quarter 2019. We anticipate extending the current Professional Services Agreement into an overall environmental services annual contact with specific annual tasks that will convert this repeat client into a perpetual source of revenue.
 
BLEST has recently completed a time and materials contract to provide regulatory analysis of the ongoing plant expansion for a chemical company based in the port areas west of Houston, Texas.
 
BLEST has been awarded two contracts totaling more than $40,000 to provide engineering design services to a national potato processing and food product company to improve the performance of air pollution control equipment associated with potato frying in Oregon, Washington and Idaho.
 
BLEST has expanded its services offering as a direct result of a recently acquired new equipment called a custom-fabricated Rotary Thermal Apparatus (“RTA”) which expands the capabilities of the company to outside clients and creates host of new business opportunities. The RTA has proven indispensable in providing data directly applicable to the design of thermal treatment systems (i.e. incinerators, thermal desorbers, catalytic oxidation units, etc.). The RTA can also prove useful in the development of various chemical production processes and optimization of process reactions. And last but not least, the RTA can be used by BLEST to conduct treatability studies (more on that below) on contaminated solids (i.e. soils, sludges, slurries) for its clients, providing design data to engineers to develop procedures, predict outcomes and control costs for remediation projects (including soil remediation). The RTA opens up an area of practice for BLEST that includes an entire subset of remediation technologies, including thermal oxidation, thermal desorption, thermal vitrification and thermally enhanced chemical fixation. We expect the acquisition of this equipment to result in new contracts that we otherwise would not be able to execute effectively.
 
The formation of BLEST was predicated on the concept that 60% of the revenue would be provided by external clients and the remaining 40% would be provided by internal clients (i.e. BioLargo Water or Odor-No-More). By reaching this goal, BLEST will provide direct positive cash flow to the BioLargo, Inc. while fulfilling its mission to provide professional engineering services to the internal client base. For calendar 2018, the ratio was approximately 40% of revenue provided by external clients and 60% provided by internal sources. The ratio for 2018 was driven by significant need from the internal client base and circumstances related to the first full year of operation for BLEST. BLEST anticipates the original target ratios to be met or exceeded in calendar 2019. This is based on an increasing number of perpetual contracts including Citizens Gas Utility District, HAVCO, Powell Valley Utilities, and APTIM/Picatinny Arsenal. These perpetual contracts, which are renewed annually, will provide a steady base load of outside client revenue that is reasonably predictable and secure.
 
In addition to continued organic growth in the external client base, BLEST has developed several business development initiatives including water pollution control services and equipment specifically designed for the microbrewery sector.  They have developed a bundle of services and technology-based products to offer a total solution for legionella prevention in public buildings. They are evaluating similar approaches for the cannabis industry as well. These markets are expanding in areas across the United States and represent significant opportunities for BLEST.
 
BLEST management believes the company can expect growth in several additional areas. For one, BLEST is under contract to design, build, and install wastewater treatment equipment and “treatment trains” for clients in collaboration with BioLargo’s water technology subsidiary BioLargo Water. Not only does this represent important synergy between two BioLargo business units, but it offers BLEST the opportunity to become a total water treatment solutions provider for customers in the widely under-served small industrial wastewater treatment sector. Another area of predicted growth is the conduct of environmental engineering and permitting work for large industrial facilities such as fuel conversion plants, an area in which BLEST has experienced an increasing number of contracts in the past quarter.

BioLargo Water and the Advanced Oxidation System - AOS
 
BioLargo Water is our wholly owned subsidiary located on campus at the University of Alberta, Canada, that has been primarily engaged in the research and development of our Advanced Oxidation System (AOS).  The AOS is our patented water treatment device that generates a series of highly oxidative species of iodine and other molecules that, because of its proprietary configuration and inner constituents, allow it to eliminate pathogenic organisms and organic contaminants as water passes through the device and it performs with extreme efficacy while consuming very little electricity. Its key application is extremely efficient decontamination and the disinfection of various waste waters.
 
The key value proposition of the AOS is its ability to eliminate a wide variety of contaminants with high performance while consuming extremely low levels of input electricity and extremely low levels of chemistry inputs – a trait made possible by the complex set of highly oxidative iodine compounds generated within the AOS reactor. Our proof-of-concept studies and case studies have generated results that project the AOS will be more cost- and energy-efficient than commonly used advanced water treatment technologies such as UV, electro-chlorination, and ozonation. This value proposition sets the AOS technology above other water treatment options, as we believe the AOS may allow safe and reliable water treatment for significantly lower cost compared to its competitors and may even enable advanced water treatment in applications where it otherwise would have been prohibitively costly.
 
The AOS has the potential to allow reliable and cost-effective water treatment in numerous industries and applications where high-level disinfection or elimination of hard-to-treat organic contaminants is required. We believe the total serviceable market for our AOS is $10.75 billion for the poultry processing, food & beverage, and storm water segments with a target beachhead market for poultry processing in North America at an estimated $240 million.
 
Our AOS was the result of breakthroughs in both advanced iodine electrochemistry and advances in materials engineering, and its invention led to BioLargo’s co-founding of a multi-year industrial research chair whose goal was to solve the contaminated water issues associated with the Canadian Oil Sands at the University of Alberta Department of Engineering in conjunction with the top five oil companies in Canada, the regional water district, and various environmental agencies of the Canadian government. Based on recovering oil prices and our ongoing work in Canada, we recently reinitiated discussions with a number of stakeholders in the oil sands industry to support the completion of AOS development for oil and gas water treatment and to discuss the initiation of pre-commercial and commercial pilots for our AOS to help treat and remediate oil sands process-affected water (“OSPW”) found in tailings ponds in the Canadian oil sands, an application that currently has no good economically viable solution. We continue to apply for significant grant funding to re-initiate our work to help treat OSPW and other oil and gas wastewaters using the AOS. We believe that this opportunity requires substantial grant support to be viable for our company and, therefore we will continue to focus on energies on other markets until such time as resources are available.
 
Our AOS is an award-winning invention that is supported by science and engineering financial support and highly competitive grants (66 and counting) from various federal and provincial funding agencies in Canada such as NSERC, NRC- IRAP, and Alberta Innovates and in the United States by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and National Water Research Institute.
 
Our immediate goals for the development and commercialization of the AOS are: 1) to secure direct investment into the BioLargo Water subsidiary to empower its staff to complete its development cycle, 2) complete the ongoing pre-commercial field pilot studies which are necessary to generate the techno-economic data required to secure commercial trials, entice future customers, and commence traversal of necessary regulatory pathways, 3) conduct the first commercial trials with the AOS, and 4) secure first sale of the AOS. It is our belief that once pre-commercial pilots have concluded with the AOS, our ability to entice major water industry players to partner with BioLargo Water to accelerate market adoption of the AOS will be increased dramatically.

Recent AOS Milestones
 
The most important advances in AOS development in recent months have been 1) recent validation of the AOS as an effective tool to eliminate hard-to-treat “micropollutants” from wastewater; 2) design and engineering advances and changes to the AOS in preparation for piloting and scale-up for industrial flow-rates and conditions; and 3) the planning and design of pre-commercial field pilot projects.
 
One recent and important AOS milestone was the demonstration that it eliminated or reduced the toxicity of certain high-concern pharmaceutical byproducts (micropollutants) common in some municipal wastewater (“MWW”) streams. Those results, collected in a collaboration with researchers at the Centre Des Technologies de L’Eau, showed that the AOS had promise as a treatment tool for eliminating pharmaceutical pollutants such as carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and amoxicillin. In a follow-up study conducted in collaboration with Dr. Greg Goss PhD, an expert in aquatic organism toxicology at the University of Alberta, BioLargo Water sought to examine A) the environmental safety of AOS-treated MWW, and B) whether the AOS’ ability to eliminate pharmaceuticals from water would improve the environmental safety of MWW “spiked” with high concentrations of micropollutant contaminants. In this study, it was shown that water treated by the AOS technology was non-toxic in long-term exposure to aquatic organisms such as Daphnia, rainbow trout, and zebrafish embryos, under the experiential conditions examined. Additionally, the AOS reduced the toxic effects of MWW that has been experientially contaminated (spiked) with compounds known to negatively affects those organisms (benzo[a]pyrene and 17®-estradiol). Finally, the study also showed that the AOS can reduce the well-documented aberrant developmental effects of 17®-estradiol (an estrogen derivative) on rainbow trout. The AOS was successful in removing 17®-estradiol from MWW spiked with the hormone, thereby reducing the developmental effects of the compound. Importantly, the AOS was also able to reduce the effects of the 17®-estradiol and/or other hormones found normally in MWW (not spiked). These projects were funded in part by the Canadian government’s National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). These results represent promising evidence that the AOS can remove micropollutants that are an emerging concern to the water treatment industry. Currently, there are no economically viable solutions to remove these compounds from MWW, and incumbent technologies fall short. We believe that the value proposition for our AOS for use as a tool for the municipal water treatment industry to efficiently remove micropollutants could increase our total serviceable market to 5% or more of the total industry which is recognized at + $700 billion globally or approximately $35 billion.
 
Several advances and improvements to the AOS have also been made in recent months with the purpose of preparing the technology for pre-commercial piloting, commercial piloting, and subsequent mass production, as well as to prepare it for scale-up to allow industrial flow rates. These advancements have largely been proprietary physical improvements to the AOS, including the transitioning of the AOS to using inner substrates more amenable to mass-production and greater flow rates and pressures. Management believes it will continue to advance the scale-up to higher volume throughputs of water flow and enhances the AOS ability to be more compact and longer lasting in the field.  This work is not complete, but management believes it does represent a significant step forward to achieving high throughput quality results. Importantly, we have also designed and begun assembling our own proprietary water treatment train that will be used in pilots for the AOS and that will pave the way for complete wastewater treatment in industrial settings.
 
Pre-commercial Pilot Projects for AOS
 
We are now underway on multiple pre-commercial field pilot projects. The first will treat poultry wastewater on-site at a poultry producer’s facility in Alberta Canada, with support from the Poultry Growers Association, where the AOS will be assessed for its ability to eliminate bacteria and other contaminants from the wastewater effectively and cost-efficiently and to establish operating costs (OPEX) and capital costs (CAPEX) in a field setting. Importantly, in this pilot, BioLargo Water is installing a complete “treatment train” with equipment to address all aspects of the client’s water treatment needs, including organic contaminants, suspended solids, and biological organisms. Therefore, this pilot also represents BioLargo’s first assessment as a “total solutions provider”, which could open the door for a wider array of future water treatment market opportunities. In the second pilot, the AOS will be used on-site at a Californian brewery as a polishing (final) step in an Aquacycl treatment train to eliminate bacteria and enable wastewater discharge in compliance with Californian regulatory standards. Aquacycl is an emerging waste-water treatment technology company based in the San Diego area that was introduced to our company by The Maritime Alliance, a trade organization in San Diego committed to fostering maritime business and technology innovation. We are a member organization, and our president has recently joined its board of directors . This pilot will help establish the efficacy of the AOS in a field setting, the OPEX and CAPEX of the system, and the AOS’ ability to “plug and play” in the context of diverse supporting equipment and logistics.

In addition to the poultry and brewery pilots, we are negotiating to begin a pilot to treat captured storm water for recycling and reuse that will be backed by a Canadian government grant and will include a leading city planning consultant in Southern California, a leading engineering firm dedicated to the water industry, and a prominent city based in Southern California. Storm water capture and reuse is an emerging market backed by the State of California pursuant to Measure W which sets aside an estimated $300 million a year from a tax to be used for public agencies to invest in related storm water capture and treatment infrastructure. Also, we were recently invited to participate in a pre-commercial pilot treating municipal wastewater in order to remove micropollutants which is organized by one of the leading engineering firms in the water industry in conjunction with prominent water treatment agency in the Pacific Northwest. Finally, we and a Chinese partner were awarded a grant co-funded by the governments of Canada and China to install an AOS pilot unit on-site at a petrochemical plant in Tianjin City, China, where the AOS would be used to eliminate hard-to-treat organic contaminants to new standards set by the Chinese government. However, we have not yet been able to verify the funding to be provided by the Chinese government to our collaborating partner, and thus are not yet fully committed to this project as it may require capital contributions that we are unwilling to commit to provide without additional funding.
 
All of these pilot projects represent an important step for our AOS technology, as well as for our company. We are confident in our disruptive water treatment technology and have proven its treatment capabilities in the lab ad nauseum. However, pilot projects for the AOS, as with any technology, are crucial to prove its reliability to industry stakeholders as well the capital cost and operating costs of our technology at-scale. These data will be critical to pave the way for future market adoption. As a reminder, we have many other pilots in evaluation to support this same cause.
 
We believe that our current designs for the AOS are cost-effective, commercially viable and should be ready for their first commercial launch in late 2019 or early 2020. We secured a patent on the AOS in 2018, and another in March 2019. We intend to continue refining and improving the AOS continually to accomplish a series of goals: expanded patent coverage, extended useful life, lower capital costs, lower energy costs, optimized performance, precise configurations for specific industry challenges, portability, and identifying its performance limits. Our current and most pressing goal for the AOS, as evidenced by the pilot projects described above, is to demonstrate its efficacy in field settings, which is a crucial and necessary step for the commercialization of any water treatment system.
 
Advanced Wound Care - Clyra Medical
 
We initially formed Clyra Medical to commercialize our technology in the medical products industry, which we believe can be disruptive to many competing product lines. Our initial product designs focus in the “advanced wound care” field, which includes traumatic injury, diabetic ulcers, and chronic hard-to-heal wounds. In late 2018, we also acquired our second technology, a stem cell therapy technology, SkinDisc, that is both complementary to our antimicrobial product designs and it also presents a high value proposition to offer stand-alone products to the advanced wound care industry to assist in regenerating tissue. With the addition of highly skilled team members with extensive experience and proven track record of success in the medical industry and, the addition of the SkinDisc, we have expanded our plans to focus and build out a complete line of products to deliver state of the art solutions to assist in healing wounds. Therefore, we are also presently evaluating a number of additional licensing opportunities to add complementary technologies and products to our medical products portfolio with the goal of offering a complete menu of proprietary and patent protected products to better serve the advanced wound care patient population with state-of-the-art medical products. We are presently seeking pre-market clearance for our first advanced wound care product (application in process), from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) under Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
 
We believe the total addressable market for Clyra Medical’s existing product designs in the advanced wound care market, dental, orthopedics and regenerative tissue markets will exceed $2.5 billion by 2022.
 
Our first and original advanced wound care product combines the broad-spectrum antimicrobial capabilities of iodine in a platform complex that promotes and facilitates wound healing. Our products are highly differentiated from existing antimicrobials in multiple ways - by the gentle nature in which they perform, extremely low dosing of active ingredients, reduced product costs, extended antimicrobial activity, and biofilm efficacy. In addition, iodine has no known acquired microbial resistance, unlike many competing products. We believe the future markets for some of our product designs may also include infection control and wound therapy in orthopedics, dental and veterinary markets. We also intend to pursue and study the use of our technology as a complimentary and synergistic platform for use with regenerative tissue therapy.

We have three patent applications pending for medical products, and are preparing additional applications. While these patent applications are pending, we intend to continue expanding patent coverage as we refine and expand our medical products.
 
We are in the process of obtaining regulatory approval (pre-market clearance) from the FDA for our first advanced wound care product. These efforts are ongoing as of the date of this annual report. Although the process has taken considerable time and money, and we have faced a number of delays as a result of the FDA’s requirements of us, we remain highly encouraged by our current interactions with the FDA staff and our current position. The process has confirmed that our product design falls in the scope of the 510(k) process and the pathway to clearance has now been better defined by senior staff at FDA. We are about to commence a large animal study to confirm that the Clyra product has no long-term adverse effects on wound healing as requested by the FDA. We believe this testing will confirm our products completely safe for use as indicated, and the results in the FDA’s hands for their evaluation within six months. While we remain confident that we will ultimately receive premarket clearance for this product, we can make no assurance or prediction as to success of these efforts, and must wait patiently for the process with the FDA to conclude. The company has numerous medical device product designs that it intends to pursue in the future as resources permit.
 
It is important to recognize that our current antimicrobial product in application is unique as an extremely low dose iodine complex resulting in an extraordinary level of testing being required by the FDA, and because of this, FDA have extended the product application for an additional six months. This is highly unusual, and FDA staff are working with us in order to allow our team to be able to deliver the test results from the large animal study as requested. We believe this product’s future role in the advanced wound care industry will be disruptive to many incumbent competing products like silver, hypochlorous acid and even other iodine-based products and therefore our extraordinary investment of time and money will have significant opportunity to generate a considerable return on investment as the products find their way through the FDA process for clearance and then to market adoption. Simply stated, we believe it is worth it and that we will succeed.
 
Our second technology and its related products center around the SkinDisc technology which we acquired in late 2018 from Scion Solutions, LLC (“Scion”). (See “Scion Solutions Acquisition – SkinDisc”, below.) Scion is led by Spencer Brown, a medical device industry veteran with more than 35 years’ experience in sales, account management, and distribution in the medical device industry. The SkinDisc product was developed by Dr. Brock Liden, a renowned medical podiatrist and expert in wound care and diabetic limb salvage. The SkinDisc is a therapy product that uses a patient’s own bone marrow and plasma in a unique mixture to generate a cell-rich bio gel for use with chronic wounds. It has been tested in over 250 patient cases with no adverse effects, and has successfully aided in the salvage of limbs that otherwise would have been amputated. The regenerative tissue therapy technique has been shown to assist in successful wound closure in time frames as short at 4 to 7 weeks with one or two  applications and is patent pending.
 
Clyra Medical also continues to actively work on the development of new products. It recently added Julian Bejarano, PhD to its team as an expert scientific researcher with more than 11 years of experience leading fundamental and applied research projects related to materials science and nanotechnology. In particular, Dr. Bejarano has six years of experience in projects related to biomaterials for regenerative medicine and multifunctional nanoparticles for controlled drug delivery. He holds a Materials Engineering degree and a Masters in Materials Engineering from the Universidad del Valle, Colombia. He also holds a PhD in Engineering Sciences with emphasis in Materials Science from the Universidad de Chile, Chile. Dr. Bejarano was a visiting researcher during his PhD studies at the Institute of Biomaterials at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. Following his doctorate studies, Dr. Bejarano was a postdoctoral fellow at the Advanced Center for Chronic Diseases in Chile for three years and Research Advisor for the Group of Polymer Engineering at the Universidad de Chile. Moreover, he has outstanding skills in project management, R&D, and innovation. His projects have been focused on the development and characterization of composites materials based on metals, polymers and ceramics, synthesis of multifunctional nanoparticles, encapsulation of therapeutic agents, and biological evaluation of materials. His findings in materials research have been published by prestigious international journals and he has presented at several international events related to biomaterials and materials science.

Clyra’s management is focused on obtaining its FDA clearance and evaluating additional technologies for purchase or license that we believe will enhance the company’s competitive position in the advanced wound care field as well as increase the company’s overall valuation.
 
We are committed to see these advanced wound care products go to market and we believe they will make a positive impact for a greater good around the world and generate meaningful financial results for our stockholders.
 
Scion Solutions Acquisition – SkinDisc
 
On September 26, 2018, we and Clyra Medical agreed to a transaction whereby we would acquire the intangible assets of Scion Solutions, LLC (“Scion”), and in particular its stem cell-based technology, the SkinDisc, and the know-how of key team members to support further research as well as the sale and distribution of Clyra Medical’s products based on our BioLargo technologies.
 
The parties entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (“Purchase Agreement”) whereby Clyra Medical acquired (and then sold to BioLargo) the Scion intangible assets, including the SkinDisc. The consideration provided to Scion is subject to an escrow agreement and earn out provisions and includes: (i) 21,000 shares of the Clyra Medical common stock; (ii) 10,000 shares of Clyra Medical common stock redeemable for BioLargo common shares (detailed below); and (iii) a promissory note in the principal amount of $1,250,000 to be paid through new capital investments and revenue, as detailed below. The Clyra Medical common stock was initially held in escrow subject to the new entity raising $1,000,000 “base capital” to fund its business operations, which was raised effective December 17, 2018 (see below). One-half of the common stock was released to scion, and the second half remains subject to the following performance metrics, each vesting one-fifth of the remaining shares of common stock: (a) notification of FDA premarket clearance of certain orthopedics products, or recognition by Clyra Medical of $100,000 gross revenue; (b) the recognition by Clyra Medical of $100,000 in aggregate gross revenue; (c) the granting of all or any part of the patent application for the SkinDisc product, or recognition by Clyra Medical of $500,000 in gross revenue; (d) recognition by Clyra Medical of $1,000,000 in aggregate gross revenue; and (e) recognition by Clyra Medical of $2,000,000 in gross revenue. In addition, Clyra and Scion entered into the $1,250,000 promissory note called for by the Purchase Agreement. The promissory note accrues interest at the rate of 5%. Principal and interest due under the note are to be paid periodically at a rate of 25% of investment proceeds received. If the note is not paid off within 18 months after the date of issuance, it is automatically extended for additional 12-month periods until the note is repaid in full. Payments after the initial 18-month maturity date are required to be made as investment proceeds are received, at a rate of 25% of such proceeds, and 5% of Clyra Medical’s gross revenues.
 
Immediately following Clyra Medical’s purchase of Scion’s assets, Clyra Medical sold to BioLargo the assets, along with 12,755 Clyra Medical common shares. In exchange, BioLargo issued Clyra Medical 7,142,858 shares of BioLargo common stock. Concurrently, BioLargo licensed back to Clyra Medical the Scion assets. Scion may exchange its 10,000 Clyra Medical common shares for the 7,142,858 shares of BioLargo common stock issued to Clyra Medical, subject to the escrow and earn-out provisions described above. As of December 31, 2018, per the Closing Agreement, one-half of these shares have been earned and thus may be redeemed, and one-half remain subject to the earn-out provisions.
 
On December 17, 2018, we entered into a closing agreement (“Closing Agreement”) reflecting the satisfaction of the obligation to raise $1,000,000 “base capital” established under the Purchase Agreement. With the satisfaction of the obligation to raise $1,000,000 in base capital, Clyra Medical agreed to release to Scion one-half of the shares of Clyra common stock exchanged for the Scion assets. The remaining Clyra Medical common shares remain subject to the Escrow Agreement dated September 26, 2018, subject to the metrics identified above. We were initially introduced to the SkinDisc product and Scion Solutions through Dr. Liden and Tanya Rhodes’s consulting work with Clyra Medical (both Dr. Liden and Ms. Rhodes have ownership interest in Scion). Prior to the execution of the above-described agreements, BioLargo did not have any material relationship with Scion’s founder Spencer Brown.

Intellectual Property
 
We have 20 patents issued, including 18 in the United States, and multiple pending. We believe these patents provide a foundation from which to continue building our patent portfolio, and we believe that our technology is sufficiently useful and novel that we have a reasonable basis upon which to rely on our patent protections. We also rely on trade secrets and technical know-how to establish and maintain additional protection of our intellectual property. As our capital resources permit, we expect to expand our patent protection as we continue to refine our inventions as well as make new discoveries. See the detailed discussion below of our patent portfolio.
 
We regard our intellectual property as critical to our ultimate success. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products and technologies in geographic areas of commercial interest and to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information through laws and contractual arrangements.
 
Our Chief Science Officer, Mr. Kenneth R. Code, has been involved in the research and development of the technology since 1997. He has participated in the Canadian Federal Scientific Research and Experimental Development program, and he was instrumental in the discovery, preparation and filing of the first technology patents. He has worked with manufacturers, distributors and suppliers in a wide variety of industries to gain a full appreciation of the potential applications and the methodologies applicable to our technology for their manufacture and performance. He continues to research methods and applications to continue to expand the potential uses of our technology as well as work to uncover new discoveries that may provide additional commercial applications to help solve real world problems in the field of disinfection.
 
We incurred approximately $1,700,000 in expense related to our research and development activities in 2018, an increase of approximately $100,000 over the prior year. We have shifted the focused in our Canadian research facility to focus on commercializing our AOS technology and thus expect these expenses to decrease in 2019.
 
We believe that our suite of intellectual property covers the presently targeted major areas of focus for our licensing strategy. The description of our intellectual property, at present, is as follows:

Pending Patent Applications
 
Most recently, we filed two patent applications in the United States for our advanced wound care formulas. The inventions in these applications form the basis for the work at Clyra Medical and the products for which that subsidiary intends to seek FDA approval. In addition to these applications, we have filed patent applications in multiple foreign countries, including the European Union, pursuant to the PCT, and other provisional applications.
 
Subject to adequate financing, we intend to continue to expand and enhance our suite of intellectual property through ongoing focus on product development, new intellectual property development and patent applications, and further third-party testing and validations for specific areas of focus for commercial exploitation. We currently anticipate that additional patent applications will be filed during the next 12 months with the USPTO and the PCT, although we are uncertain of the cost of such patent filings, which will depend upon the number of such applications prepared and filed. The expense associated with seeking patent rights in multiple foreign countries is expensive and will require substantial ongoing capital resources. However, we cannot give any assurance that adequate capital will be available. Without adequate capital resources, we will be forced to abandon patent applications and irrevocably lose rights to our technologies.
