ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview 
 
We are a direct-to-patient telehealth company providing patients a high-quality, cost-effective, and convenient way of accessing comprehensive, virtual healthcare. We believe the traditional model of visiting a doctor’s office, traveling to a local pharmacy, and returning for follow up care or prescription refills is complex, inefficient, and costly, and discourages many individuals from seeking much needed medical care. LifeMD is positioned to elevate the healthcare experience through telehealth with our proprietary technology platform, affiliated provider network, broad treatment capabilities, and unique ability to nurture patient relationships.
 
The LifeMD telehealth platform seamlessly integrates a clinician-centric electronic medical record (“EMR”) system, proprietary algorithms for case-load balancing and scheduling, customer relationship management (“CRM”) functionality, remote and in-home lab testing, and digital prescription capabilities, patient-provider audio/video interfacing, cloud pharmacy fulfillment, and more. Our proprietary technology platform, combined with our 50-state affiliated provider network, enables the management of virtual treatment offerings and complex patient journeys for hundreds of conditions spanning men’s and women’s health, dermatology, urgent, and primary care, chronic care management and more. Our telehealth offerings in general seek to connect patients to licensed providers for diagnoses, virtual care, and prescription medications when appropriate. We also offer over-the-counter (“OTC”) products that are complementary to the conditions we treat. Our virtual primary care services are primarily offered on a subscription basis.
 
Our mission is to empower people to live healthier lives by increasing access to high quality and affordable virtual and in-home healthcare. We believe our success has and will continue to be attributable to an amazing patient experience, retaining the highest-quality providers in the industry, and our end-to-end technology platform. We plan to build a diverse portfolio of differentiated telehealth service offerings that meet the needs of a growing and diversified patient base.
 
Since inception, we have helped approximately 680,000 customers and patients, providing them greater access to high-quality, convenient, and affordable care in all 50 states. Our telehealth revenue increased 21% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Total revenue from recurring subscriptions is approximately 90%. In addition to our telehealth business, we own 73.64% of WorkSimpli, which operates PDFSimpli, a rapidly growing software as a service platform for converting, signing, editing, and sharing PDF documents. This business has seen 47% year-over-year revenue growth, with recurring revenue of 98%.
 
Our Platform and Business Strategy
 
We are a patient-centric telehealth company dedicated to delivering seamless end-to-end virtual healthcare to consumers. Our mission is facilitated by our robust technology platform that is purpose-built to seamlessly connect the touchpoints involved in delivering complex care, including scheduling for a national provider network, EMR capabilities, secure synchronous and asynchronous communication, digital prescriptions, cloud pharmacy, and more. Our platform enables us to deliver modern personalized health experiences and offerings through our websites and mobile applications, spanning customer discovery, purchase, and connection with licensed providers, to pharmacy and OTC order fulfillment, through ongoing care. We believe that our seamless approach significantly reduces the complication, cost and time burden of healthcare, incentivizing consumers to stick with our brands.
 
Our proprietary platform also facilitates and accelerates the development and launch of novel offerings throughout clinical protocol establishment, marketing, and fulfillment. Our offerings are sold to consumers on a subscription basis thus creating convenience and discounted pricing opportunities for patients and recurring revenue streams for the Company. Our offerings range from prescription medication fulfilled on a recurring basis, to complementary OTC products, to ongoing care from a team of medical providers. In general, our offerings seek to serve a patient from beginning to end, starting from brand or offering discovery to the medical intake and product selection process, after which a licensed United States (“U.S.”) physician conducts a virtual consultation and determines a treatment plan. As appropriate, prescription medications and OTC products are filled by pharmacy fulfillment partners, and if preferred, shipped directly to the patient. The number of patients and customers we serve across the nation continues to increase at a robust pace, with more than 680,000 individuals having purchased our products and services to date.
 
Serving as a robust CRM system, and with built in analytics and integrations with best-in-class performance marketing platforms, our platform also enhances our ability to effectively and efficiently acquire new patients and customers and drive brand visibility through strategic media placements, influencer partnerships, and direct response advertising methods across highly scalable marketing channels (i.e., national TV, streaming TV, streaming audio, YouTube, podcasts, Out of Home, print, magazines, online search, social media, and digital).
 
We leverage our telehealth technology platform and services across the three core areas described below:
 
Direct-to-Consumer Virtual Primary Care
 
In the first quarter of 2022, we launched our flagship virtual primary care offering under the LifeMD brand, LifeMD PC. This offering provides patients in all 50 states with 24/7 access to an affiliated high-quality provider for their primary care, urgent care, and chronic care needs. LifeMD’s virtual primary care offering is a mobile-first full-service destination that provides seamless access to high-quality clinical care including virtual consultations and treatment, prescription medications, diagnostics, and imaging, wellness coaching and more. This offering is also supported by robust partnerships that provide our patients benefits such as substantial discounts on lab work and a prescription discount card that can be presented at over 60,000 pharmacies to save up to 92% on their prescription medication.

Direct-to-Patient Telehealth
We also leverage our telehealth platform’s provider network, cloud pharmacy, and EMR capabilities across our direct-to-patient telehealth brands. Our telehealth brands RexMD, ShapiroMD, NavaMD, and Cleared address largely unaddressed or underserved needs and are leading destinations in their respective treatment verticals of men’s health, hair loss, dermatology, and immunology.
 

○ | RexMD is a men’s telehealth platform brand that offers access to virtual medical treatment for a variety of men’s health needs. After treatment from an affiliated licensed physician, if appropriate, one of our partner pharmacies will dispense and ship prescription medications and OTC products directly to the customer. Since RexMD’s initial launch in the erectile dysfunction treatment market, it has expanded into additional indications, including but not limited to, premature ejaculation, testosterone, and hair loss. RexMD is a leading men’s telehealth platform across the U.S. and has served more than 390,000 customers and patients since inception with a 4.6-star Trustpilot rating.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | ShapiroMD offers access to virtual medical treatment, prescription medications, patented doctor formulated OTC products, topical compounded medications, and Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved medical devices treating male and female hair loss through our telehealth platform. ShapiroMD has emerged as a leading destination for hair loss treatment across the U.S. and has served more than 260,000 customers and patients since inception with a 4.9-star Trustpilot rating. 
○ | NavaMD is a female-oriented, tele-dermatology brand that offers access to virtual medical treatment from dermatologists and other providers, and, if appropriate, prescription oral and compounded topical medications to treat dermatological conditions such as aging and acne. In addition to the brand’s telehealth offerings, NavaMD’s proprietary products leverage intellectual property and proprietary formulations licensed from Restorsea, a leading medical grade skincare technology platform. 
○ | Cleared is a telehealth brand that provides personalized treatments for allergy, asthma, and immunology. Offerings include in-home tests for both environmental and food allergies, prescriptions for allergies and asthma, and FDA-approved immunotherapies for treating chronic allergies. Cleared leverages a network of affiliated medical professionals and providers in all 50 states, various pharmaceutical partners, and treatments and tests that cost up to 50 percent less than the brand-name competition. The offerings include free consultations, prescription medication, complementary OTC products, and ongoing care from U.S.-licensed allergists and nurses. 

Enterprise Telehealth Offerings
 
Organizations commercializing healthcare products face a challenging commercial landscape. Increased competition, shrinking market sizes and challenges reaching patients via the traditional brick and mortar doctor are forcing pharmaceutical, medical device and diagnostic companies to rethink their commercial strategies and focus more on digital patient awareness and engagement initiatives. Spending on digital solutions to facilitate greater access to their end markets accounts for one-third of their collective $30 billion commercial spend in the U.S. We believe LifeMD’s unique telehealth technology platform and virtual clinical expertise is well-positioned to address the unmet needs of healthcare product companies as they relate to digital patient awareness, access to care, adherence and compliance.
Majority Owned Subsidiary: WorkSimpli
 
WorkSimpli operates PDFSimpli, an online software as a service platform that allows users to create, edit, convert, sign, and share PDF documents. WorkSimpli was acquired through the purchase of 51% of the membership interests of WorkSimpli Software LLC, a Puerto Rico limited liability company, which operates a marketing-driven software solutions business. In addition to WorkSimpli’s growth business model, this acquisition added deep search engine optimization and search engine marketing expertise to the Company. On January 22, 2021, the Company consummated a transaction and increased its ownership of WorkSimpli to 85.6%. Effective September 30, 2022, two option agreements were exercised which further restructured the ownership of WorkSimpli. As a result, the Company’s ownership interest in WorkSimpli decreased to 73.64%.
 
WorkSimpli was ranked in the top 7,840 websites globally, with more than 40 million registrants. Since its launch, WorkSimpli has converted or edited over 258 terabytes of documents for customers from the legal, financial, real-estate and academic sectors. WorkSimpli had over 167,000 active subscriptions as of December 31, 2022.

Customers
 
Our customer base includes men and women seeking virtual primary care and virtual medical treatment for hair loss, men’s sexual health issues, dermatology, and allergy and asthma. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Our Growth Strategy
 
We have achieved rapid growth since our transformation into a healthcare focused company in 2018, with a compounded annual growth rate in revenue of nearly 112% since 2019 and growth of 28% in 2022 as compared to 2021. We believe this validates our significant long-term investments in developing our human capital, technology, brand-awareness, omni-channel marketing, and operations infrastructure. We will continue to make wise investments in differentiated telehealth service offerings and in initiatives that will enhance the experience our patients have with our platform.
 
As a result of this focused investment in the customer experience, including allocation of additional resources and expertise, we expect customer repurchase rates and overall customer retention to strengthen. While we are proud of our accomplishments to date, we believe the most exciting opportunities for our growth story are ahead of us, and we intend to focus in the following areas to help us achieve this growth.
 
There remains a large underserved market within primary care, hair loss, erectile dysfunction, men’s and women’s health, dermatology, as well as allergies and asthma into which we intend to continue to aggressively scale in 2023 and beyond. We plan to continue to build a robust operational infrastructure to enable us to not only provide better patient care but also drive better unit economics for our business.
 
Competition
 
The markets we sell into are large and highly competitive. Numerous online brands compete with us for customers throughout the U.S. and internationally in virtual primary care, men’s and women’s health, dermatology, and allergy. We also compete with traditional mass merchandisers, drug store chains, and independent pharmacies. Key to retaining and growing our position in the market is taking a patient-centric approach to telehealth, with a strong emphasis on the quality-of-care we deliver to our patients. Our human capital and know-how, proprietary technology platform, and unique product offerings represent meaningful strengths that we believe will enable us to maintain and grow our market-leading position in the U.S.

Our key competitive strengths include:
 
High-Quality Care
 
Our telehealth platform is designed to give patients more control over their healthcare spending, greater convenience in how and when they pursue or receive care, and better outcomes as hurdles to healthcare services are removed for the care or medications they need. We are committed to delivering exceptional care that is convenient and affordable. This is achieved through our provider network, including affiliated, full-time doctors and nurse practitioners, in addition to a dedicated patient care center launched in November 2020 and staffed by LifeMD employees. The patient care center includes approximately 114 employees and is led by an experienced operations and customer experience team. We believe the hands-on capabilities of the patient care center, supported by our technology platform, will continue to drive high levels of patient satisfaction like we see today.


Technology Platform
 
Our telehealth technology platform is continually optimized as we scale, and this flexible infrastructure can be repurposed for any variety of existing or future telehealth offerings. Further, this platform allows for rapid development and scale of new telehealth offerings as we identify attractive opportunities. Additional key capabilities of this platform include proprietary staffing algorithms for case-load balancing, full CRM functionality, integration with an affiliated 50 state physician network, national third-party pharmacy network, fully integrated EMR system, synchronous and asynchronous communications, and more.
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on trademark and copyright law, trade-secret protection and confidentiality, patents, and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain proprietary rights, technologies or copyrighted materials from third-parties, and we rely on those third-parties to defend their proprietary rights, copyrights, and technologies.
 
From time-to-time, we register our principal brand names in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. Our material trademarks include ShapiroMD Hair Growth Experts® and Cleared®. Trademark applications have been filed and are being prosecuted for RexMD, LifeMD and NavaMD. The steps we take to protect our proprietary rights in our brand names may not be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our brand names in the U.S. or abroad. Existing trademark laws afford only limited practical protection for our product lines. The laws and the level of enforcement of such laws in certain foreign countries where we market our products often do not protect our proprietary rights in our products to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.

We have two U.S. patents relating to our Shapiro MD products’ method for treatment of hair loss with a combination of natural ingredients with one granted on March 24, 2015 and the other on January 3, 2017. In order to protect the confidentiality of our intellectual property, including trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, it is our policy to limit access to such information to those who require access in order to perform their functions and to enter into agreements with employees, consultants, and vendors to contractually protect such information.
 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
 
We use third parties to manufacture and package our OTC products according to the formulas and packaging guidelines we dictate. In order to minimize costs, we may elect to purchase raw or bulk materials directly from our suppliers and have them shipped to our manufacturers so that we may incur only tableting, encapsulating, and/or packaging costs and avoid the additional costs associated with purchasing the finished product.
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
FDA and Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”)
 
Our business is heavily regulated by the FDA and the FTC. The FDA enforces the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (“DSHEA”) as they pertain to foods, food ingredients, cosmetics and dietary supplement production and marketing. Dietary supplements are regulated as a category of food, not as drugs. We are not required to obtain FDA pre-market approval to sell our dietary supplement products in the U.S. under current laws. Our OTC hair loss products are regulated as cosmetics under the FDCA.
 
The FDA imposes Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) guidelines to ensure that prescription drugs and dietary supplements are produced in a quality manner, do not contain contaminants or impurities, and are accurately labeled. GMP guidelines include requirements for establishing quality control procedures, designing, and constructing manufacturing plants, testing ingredients and finished products, record keeping, and handling of consumer product complaints. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to prescription drugs, dietary supplements and cosmetics, including the power to monitor claims made in product labeling, to seize adulterated or misbranded products or unapproved new drugs, to request product recall, and to issue warning letters. FDA also may refer cases to the Department of Justice to enjoin further manufacture or sale of a product, to issue warning letters, and to institute criminal proceedings.
 
Advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy of products are also regulated by the FTC. The FTC regulates the advertising of dietary supplements, cosmetics and other health-related products to ensure that any advertising is truthful and not misleading, and that an advertiser maintains adequate substantiation for all product claims. FTC-launched enforcement actions may result in consent decrees, cease and desist orders, judicial injunctions and the payment of fines with respect to advertising claims that are found to be unsubstantiated.
 
Under current U.S. regulations, our products must comply with certain labeling requirements enforced by the FDA and FTC, but otherwise generally are not required to receive regulatory approval prior to introduction into the U.S. market. We believe we are in compliance with all material government regulations applicable to our products.
 
In addition to the foregoing, our operations and those of our partners are subject to federal, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to the practice of medicine, telehealth and the prescribing of prescription medications. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all material governmental regulations applicable to our operations.
 
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 
The data we collect and process is an integral part of our products and services, allowing us to ensure our prices are accurate and relevant, and reach and advertise to consumers with savings information. We collect and may use personal information to help run our business (including for analytical and marketing purposes) and to communicate and otherwise reach our consumers. In some instances, we may use third party service providers to assist us in the above.
 
We endeavor to treat our consumers’ data with respect and maintain consumer trust. We provide consumers options designed to allow them to control the use and disclosure of their data, such as allowing consumers to opt out of any marketing requests, opt out of the use of marketing cookies, pixels and technologies on our platform, and request deletion of their data.
 
Since we receive, use, transmit, disclose and store personally identifiable information, including health-related information, we are subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations that address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, transfer, disclosure and protection of certain types of data. Such regulations include the CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the criminal healthcare fraud provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). The CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. Similar legislation has been proposed or adopted in other states. Aspects of the CCPA and these other state laws and regulations, as well as their enforcement, remain unclear, and we may be required to modify our practices in an effort to comply with them. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), was passed on November 3, 2020 and became effective on January 1, 2023, with a look-back to January 2022. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty.

Additionally, the FTC, and many state attorneys general are interpreting existing federal and state consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of health-related and other personal information. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. Consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that describe how we handle personal information and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal information. If such information that we publish is considered untrue, we may be subject to government claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences. Furthermore, according to the FTC violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act.
 
In addition, HIPAA, which we believe does not currently apply to most of our business as currently operated, imposes on entities within its jurisdiction, among other things, certain standards relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
 
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Although the consumers who use our offerings do so outside of any medication or other health benefits covered under their health insurance, including any commercial or government healthcare program, we may nonetheless be subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
 
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions, and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
 
The federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 
In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits, among other things, the offer or transfer of remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies.
 
State Licensing Requirements
 
Certain states have enacted laws regulating companies that offer and market discount medical plans, including prescription drug plans, subscription membership programs, or discount cards, such as our prescription offering. These state laws are intended to protect consumers from fraudulent, unfair, or deceptive marketing, sales and enrollment practices by such plans. It is possible that other states may enact new requirements or interpret existing requirements to include our programs. Failure to obtain the required licenses, certifications or registrations to offer and market these subscription discount programs may result in civil penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders, or a restructuring of our operations.
State Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting Laws
 
With respect to our telehealth platform, we contract with our physician-owned professional corporation, LifeMD PC, to deliver our telehealth offerings to its patients in the U.S. We entered into a management services agreement with LifeMD PC pursuant to which we provide them with billing, scheduling and a wide range of other services, and they pay us for those services. In addition, our platform enables consumers to opt in to use our prescription offering and/or fill their prescriptions through a third-party mail-order pharmacy. These relationships are subject to various state laws, which are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment and prohibiting the sharing of professional services income with non-professional or business interests. These laws vary from state to state and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. A determination of non-compliance could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our providers, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, or a restructuring of our arrangements with our affiliated professional entities.
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 220 employees, of which 199 were full-time, 4 were part-time, and 17 were temporary employees. Of our total employees, 114 were based at our patient care center in Greenville, SC. We use the services of consultants and third-party service providers, where needed. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
We expect headcount to continue to grow in the future, especially as we continue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions, in various functions related to our operations as a publicly traded company, and to support our continued growth. We pride ourselves on hiring people who not only have the skills required to perform their respective roles, but also share in the Company’s mission.
 
To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program for key executive officers and other employees. We also provide comprehensive benefits, including health insurance for employees and dependents, 401(k) match for employees and unlimited paid time off for exempt employees. In managing our business, we strive to develop and implement policies and programs that support our business goals, maintain competitiveness, promote shared fiscal responsibility among the Company and our employees, strategically align talent within our organization and reward performance, while also managing the costs of such policies and programs. Our employees are supported with training to ensure compliance with our policies. We adhere to our business code of conduct, which sets forth a commitment to our stakeholders, including our employees, to operate with integrity and mutual respect.
