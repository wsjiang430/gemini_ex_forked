We have enabled over 1,500 customers to deploy passive optical, Active Ethernet and point-to-point Ethernet fiber access networks.
Industry Background and Trends
CSPs compete in a rapidly changing market to deliver a range of services to their residential and business subscribers. Subscribers purchase an array of services from providers, starting with basic voice and data through advanced broadband services such as high-speed Internet, Internet protocol television, or IPTV, mobile broadband, high-definition, ultra-high-definition and over-the-top video and online gaming from a variety of CSPs. Consumers are also rapidly adding devices that require high bandwidth, low latency services such as virtual and augmented reality as well as IoT devices that bring significant complexity to the premises network. It is likely that adoption of autonomous technologies such as self-driving cars will dramatically increase demand and complexity.
The rapid growth in new technologies is generating increased network traffic and putting pressure on CSPs to cost effectively upgrade and enhance their networks to meet demand. For example, Cisco Systems, Inc. estimates that global Internet Protocol, or IP, traffic on a monthly basis will increase from 122 exabytes in 2017 to 396 exabytes in 2022, representing a compound annual growth rate of 26%. By 2022, 81% of IP traffic will originate from non-personal computer devices. The impact of video service on network traffic will become even more pronounced with the introduction of ultra-high-definition video streaming. For example, an Internet-enabled high-definition television that draws 2 hours of content per day generates as much traffic as an entire typical household today. Combined with the growth of video viewing on smartphones and tablets, demands on the network will continue to accelerate. The proliferation of new devices (and usage patterns) creates a tremendous opportunity and increases the pressure on CSPs to offer new services and create revenue streams by mastering the complexity of the smart home and business for their subscribers.
The Emergence of Web-Scale Players as a Competitive Force
The level of competition among CSPs - wireline and wireless service providers, cable MSOs and other CSPs - has increased over the last decade as traditional service boundaries have fallen. All providers are now competing for the same residential and business subscribers using similar types of IP-based services. The explosion of new technologies in the subscriber premises creates significant new opportunities for all CSPs. Technology innovators of all types and sizes are moving aggressively to seize that opportunity. Perhaps the most significant recent change in the competitive dynamic across the communications

industry is the aggressive entrance of web-scale players into subscribers’ homes and businesses via interactive smart home hubs and devices. These entrants, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft, are extending their current platforms (e.g., data driven search, e-commerce) into subscriber premises with new devices and services that are helping to reshape the home environment. The simplicity of operating these devices, as well as their use of data, enables these web-scale players to rapidly deploy new services and command a central place in the subscriber’s daily life. The level of insight that they generate by mining user data, coupled with their DevOps business model, positions them to offer and deploy services to subscribers at pace that traditional CSP operating and business models cannot match.
To address this challenge and establish control of the device-enabled subscriber, we believe CSPs must respond by leveraging analytical tools that utilize network data and subscriber behavioral data to tailor services that meet the individual subscribers’ needs. These services include high-bandwidth packages, managed Wi-Fi, whole home Wi-Fi and smart home and business services. We believe these new services represent the CSP’s greatest opportunity to create new revenue streams and higher average revenue per user, or ARPU, while reducing subscriber churn. CSPs must also mine network and subscriber data to streamline and automate subscriber facing functions such as customer service. These data-driven approaches can significantly reduce service costs, improve profitability and support investment in new services and technologies. Increasingly, companies in the communications space will embrace strategies that apply machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies that promise to dramatically improve the subscriber experience, build subscriber intimacy and loyalty, while increasing ARPU. By leveraging data to build a tighter bond with their subscribers and deliver high-value services, CSPs can more effectively meet the challenge presented by web-scale players.
The Rise of Smart Premises
We believe 2018 was the tipping point for the smart home market. IoT, virtual reality and other connected devices have become mainstream for many consumers and they are increasingly prevalent in subscriber premises. Worldwide, the smart speaker installed base is expected to reach more than 225 million units by 2020 according to Canalys. IDC anticipates a compound annual growth rate of 18.5% as the smart home market balloons to 939.7 million devices shipped in 2022. Finally, according to Statista, the average annual revenue per installed smart home amounts to $186. Leading technology players such as Amazon and Apple recognize this new business opportunity, and they have created significant new smart premises offerings. This trend exacerbates the significant disruption to CSP business models already created by “over-the-top” services like Netflix, Facebook and YouTube.
To improve performance and coverage throughout their homes, many subscribers are purchasing Wi-Fi routers and gateways via consumer channels and introducing them into the home network. Since these consumer products do not provide carrier class management capabilities that enable remote diagnostics, management and troubleshooting, performance issues can create satisfaction issues for the subscriber and a cost burden for the service provider. The introduction of smart devices into the home is accelerating the scale and complexity of these management challenges for CSPs. According to Parks Associates, nearly 50% of smart home device owners reported issues setting up their devices. Increasingly, subscribers view any device that is connected to the home network as the purview and responsibility of their CSP regardless of what the device is or where they may have purchased it. When these issues arise, subscribers typically contact their CSPs for help. 
Recognizing that many subscribers see the CSP as the logical source of insights and services that enable the smart home and business, innovative CSPs are developing strategies and business models that embrace these new technologies via carrier class premises systems. Over the last year, several of the largest and most innovative CSPs have announced strategies that incorporate the latest technologies such as voice interaction and IoT connectivity into their service offerings for subscribers. By leveraging cloud management technologies and developing a proactive strategy for smart device connectivity, voice interaction, security and premises system instrumentation, CSPs can position themselves as the critical enabler of the smart home and business. Winners will embrace software platforms that enable all of these capabilities and premises systems that provide a foundation for turning the current burden of the smart home into new services and revenue streams.
The Shift to a DevOps Business Model
Access networks directly and physically connect the residential or business subscriber to the CSP’s data center, central office or similar facilities and create the on-ramp to the Internet. The access network is critical for service delivery as it governs the bandwidth capacity, service quality available to subscribers and ultimately the services and experience CSPs can provide to subscribers. Providing differentiated, high-quality, high-speed connectivity has become increasingly critical for CSPs to retain and expand their subscriber base and launch new revenue-generating services. To meet the demands of device-enabled subscribers, CSPs are starting to deploy access technologies that are software defined and leverage next generation Passive Optical Network, or PON, architectures such as NG-PON2, XGS-PON and 10G EPON. In doing so, they will address many of limitations of legacy access systems:
5


• | Limited capacity of outdated access architectures - Network architectures have physical limitations in their ability to scale bandwidth, avoid latency issues and deliver the advanced broadband services subscribers demand today and are expected to increasingly demand in the future.


• | Inflexible networks that constrain subscriber offerings – Networks were designed to support a narrow range of services, and as a result, they limit the ability of CSPs to deploy the advanced broadband services increasingly demanded by their subscribers.


• | Expensive to deploy and operate – With a wide variety of equipment installed, networks require significant downtime and labor for maintenance and upgrades, thereby placing a significant and recurring capital and operating expense burden on CSPs.


• | Back-office systems that inhibit deployment of new services - Traditional methods for operationalizing new products and services often require significant testing and lengthy back-office integration activities. This often places CSPs at a competitive disadvantage relative to emerging service providers that are leveraging agile management practices.

By replacing traditional hardware functions with SDA, as well as software defined networking, or SDN, CSPs can overcome these operational challenges and bring new products and services to market faster. Many CSPs are embracing SDA and SDN to help accelerate innovation, deploy automation, bring agility to their network and significantly reduce service disruptions. By embracing standards-based, modular software platforms that abstract software functions from hardware, CSPs can free themselves from a dependence on specific hardware technologies and upgrade their access network to enable a DevOps business model. The winning service providers of the future will embrace SDA platforms and transform their access networks into a competitive weapon. Ultimately, this new model will enable CSPs to manage a complete range of access systems across every deployment scenario (e.g., central office, head-end, cabinet, mounted on a pole) in a consistent manner. With this shift they will introduce services at a pace that can then match the speed of the web-scale players.
The Imperative to Develop Lean Operating Models
CSPs face a dual challenge in the coming years - mounting competitive pressure and the requirement to increase their investments in technologies that can deliver the new services that their subscribers demand. Most will need to make shifts in their operating models to thrive in the coming decade. They must implement a lean operating model that reduces the overall operating cost to run the network and deliver services to subscribers at an accelerated pace as well as at a significantly lowered cost. The adoption of new technologies that provide automation and intelligence, such as SDA, will help service providers adopt agile operating models and reduce the burden of network and back-office operations. 
The Deployment of 5th Generation, or 5G, Networks
As subscribers adopt next generation mobile applications and technologies, the demand for higher bandwidth, lower latency and dramatically higher device densities is accelerating. Because existing LTE mobile networks are increasingly challenged to meet these demands, many CSPs are announcing and moving to deploy 5G mobile networks that promise dramatically greater performance and capabilities for mobile and fixed broadband services. 5G is significantly different from previous generations in the mobile evolution because it delivers higher bandwidth (10 Gbps per radio), lower latency (less than 1 msec) and supports a dramatically greater number of connections (1 million devices per km2). By leveraging higher frequency spectrum and more efficient data encoding, 5G offers CSPs a path to differentiate their services and shift the competitive landscape. CSPs are pursuing two major strategies to deploy 5G capabilities across their networks:

• | Upgrading existing LTE infrastructure - By upgrading their existing LTE wireless networks with 5G radios, CSPs will realize 10 to 20 percent higher bandwidth for 5G mobile devices. This approach will offer a quick path to 5G services for some CSPs and may differentiate their mobile broadband services. However, this incremental strategy offers relatively limited improvements in wireless capacity.

6


• | Leveraging millimeter wavelength technology - Leading CSPs will deploy thousands of millimeter wave 5G small cells to realize a 5- to 10-fold increase in capacity across their mobile and fixed broadband networks. This approach will enable CSPs to support virtually any next generation mobile, augmented or virtual reality, IoT or autonomous vehicle or device application. This will open up tremendous new business opportunities for early adopters. Due to the inherent range limitations of millimeter wave technology, 5G small cells must be deployed in very close proximity to subscriber devices. This will require the deployment of thousands of 5G small cells throughout a CSPs network to deliver services to subscribers.

With the adoption of 5G millimeter wavelength technology, CSPs will require transport that is both very capable and economically efficient. CSP cell networks will ultimately come to resemble high-density broadband access networks that leverage high-bandwidth, reliable fiber transport. To make the economics work, CSPs will ultimately need to embrace fiber efficient point-to-multi-point capabilities offered by NG-PON2 that include: 

• | Aggregated 10 gigabit services delivered over a single wave length;


• | Channel bonding to increase capacity delivered for a single service; and


• | Multiple wave lengths over a single PON to provide unmatched resiliency and low latency operations.

While 5G networks will be significantly more capable, the deployment of thousands of radio stations will introduce significant operational complexity for CSPs. As a result, 5G will accelerate the imperative for CSPs to adopt SDA technologies that simplify network operations and architectures. CSPs will also need to embrace advanced premises systems that exploit the capabilities delivered by 5G fixed wireless access networks to deliver an exceptional subscriber experience.
The Role of Governments in Supporting Technology Investment
As CSPs face increasing competitive pressure, they must accelerate their investments to upgrade their access networks and deploy new subscriber facing technologies. Governments around the world recognize the importance of expanding broadband networks and delivering advanced broadband services to more people and businesses. As a result, many governments have established stimulus programs or other incentives for broadband investment.
In the United States, programs like the Connect America Fund, or CAF, and E-Rate provide billions of dollars each year to CSPs in the form of capital investment incentives, grants and loans to encourage broadband network investment in unserved or underserved communities and schools. For example, in 2015, the CAF program was authorized to distribute $1.5 billion per year through 2020 to offset the costs of installing and operating CSP operated broadband and voice networks for large service providers in the United States. In 2016, this program was extended to smaller service providers to distribute $2.0 billion annually over the next 10 years to offset the costs of installing and operating CSP operated broadband and voice networks. In order to promote greater accountability, in 2019 the Federal Communications Commission established a uniform framework for measuring the speed and latency performance for recipients of CAF. CSPs who wish to continue leveraging this program must seek new solutions that enable them to report and demonstrate their ability to meet the requirements established by this new framework. In addition, the E-Rate program was authorized to offer $1.5 billion in grants to build gigabit capable network connections to schools. The E-Rate program targeted at networks is funded at its current level indefinitely.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in 2016 created a fund targeted at increasing broadband coverage and speeds that made available up to $750 million over the next five years, and the European Commission is pursuing similar goals via its Connecting Europe Facility and other programs.
There are also increasing investments being made by governments at the state level. Programs such as Minnesota’s Border-to-Border Grant Program ($20 million in 2017), Tennessee’s Broadband Accessibility Act ($45 million over three years) and New York’s Broadband for All Program ($500 million over three years) have created grant programs that encourage investments in broadband to unserved areas. These state level programs will complement national programs and increase investment in unserved and underserved areas.
With the increasing importance of broadband connectivity and the evolution of the smart home and business market, we expect this investment focus to continue and potentially increase to accommodate higher service tiers. World-class connectivity and services are becoming essential capabilities for individuals, as well as businesses and nations, who strive to remain economically competitive in an increasingly global and connected marketplace.
Strategy Overview
We believe that many CSPs can and will evolve to providing the most relevant services and experience to their subscribers. Today, many CSPs command a privileged and strategic position in their subscribers’ premises. They provide a service that is becoming a necessity for most subscribers. With significant new technologies coming into the marketplace, the opportunities to generate new revenue streams are manifold. However, the journey from connectivity provider to essential provider of high 
7

bandwidth Wi-Fi and services for the smart home and business will require significant transformation for most CSPs. Our strategy is to position Calix as the essential provider of platforms and services that enable this transformation. The principal elements of our strategy are:

Representation that summarizes the primary benefits delivered by Calix Cloud:
Calix Marketing Cloud (CMC) – CMC enables marketers to move away from a one-size-fits-all approach to marketing and deliver personalized campaigns. CMC provides insights regarding subscriber behavior including website visits, social channel engagement, device usage and bandwidth consumption. CMC also helps CSPs identify subscribers who are experiencing service issues and exhibiting behaviors that correlate with higher churn rates (e.g., running speed tests). By delivering these insights through intuitive segmentation dashboards and tailored analytics, CMC helps CSPs deliver the right message, at the optimal time, via the optimal channel. CMC enables CSPs to adopt data-driven strategies to effectively compete with web-scale players.
Calix Support Cloud (CSC) – Recent Calix studies demonstrate that a large portion of support calls result from Wi-Fi performance issues. Since Wi-Fi related support calls take approximately three times as long to complete as the average support call, reducing these calls can significantly improve operational efficiency. CSC enables more informed and efficient conversations between CSP customer service representatives and their subscribers. Support personnel utilize troubleshooting dashboards and tailored analytics that are built directly into their work flows to quickly identify issues with network, devices and Wi-Fi performance. Once the issues are identified, many can be resolved via CSC with a simple click of a button. Recent enhancements to CSC include automation capabilities that can fix many common issues without any manual intervention. We intend to incorporate more advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities into CSC to help CSPs optimize their support processes and improve subscriber experiences.
We have recently augmented the capabilities of Calix Cloud to help CSPs analyze smart home device and service adoption and performance across their subscriber base. These capabilities provide the intelligence that is required to craft targeted campaigns for marketing smart home offerings and managing smart device performance in the subscriber premises. Complexity is an inherent characteristic of the smart home and business. We believe that the intelligence provide by the Calix Cloud is rapidly becoming a necessity for any CSP entering the smart home and business market.
Calix Cloud software is hosted in a cloud data center, and Calix offers an array of support, customer success and service offerings that are designed to ensure rapid deployment and easy adoption of Calix Cloud.
EXOS Platform
EXOS is a carrier class premises operating system and software platform that supports residential, business and mobile subscribers. EXOS is the first premises operating system that is designed to help CSPs elevate every aspect of their business by rapidly deploying new services for the smart home and business. EXOS incorporates a software model that is standards-based, fully abstracted from the hardware and always-on. Thanks to the unique architecture of EXOS, CSPs can offer new subscriber services and master the complexity of the subscriber edge. Armed with EXOS, CSPs can select and rapidly deploy smart home services such as cloud-enabled voice services, IoT services and parental controls. EXOS is the foundation of our Calix Smart Home and Business Solution that includes our recently launched GigaSpire premises gateway family, Calix Cloud and the Calix Solutions Exchange. When combined with these capabilities, EXOS offers a unique and powerful services enablement platform.

Representation that summarizes the primary benefits delivered by EXOS and the Calix Smart Home and Business Solution:
EXOS is architected to abstract software functionality from the underlying system-on-chip in premises gateways. The EXOS abstraction layer isolates applications and management software from the Linux kernel and low-level chipset functions, regardless of the hardware deployed for specific residential and business use cases. This architecture simplifies software updates and streamlines operational processes. The EXOS abstraction layer also ensures the delivery of a consistent subscriber experience regardless of the specific hardware deployed to subscribers. EXOS leverages Linux containers that provide complete flexibility to CSPs when they deploy application packages to create new revenue streams. The Linux containers also offer an ideal environment for third-party software vendors to add their applications to the EXOS ecosystem via the Calix Solutions Exchange. This “containerized” architecture also ensures that new applications may be deployed without the requirement to regression test the entire applications portfolio running on the system. This approach accelerates time to market for new services.
The EXOS management plane is decoupled and centralized, enabling CSPs to manage all applications simultaneously, even if applications are installed independently. The EXOS architecture ensures that subscribers receive an “always on” service and benefit from application updates without the need to “re-boot” their premises systems or schedule service visits. The Microservices Aggregation Platform, or MAP, that supports EXOS captures data from every system or activity across a subscriber base. As CSPs deploy EXOS they can leverage this data for performance analytics, subscriber experience insights, marketing, maintenance and the application of artificial intelligence for predictive modeling.
Because EXOS is fully abstracted from the underlying hardware, it provides CSPs with the flexibility to offer services on the hardware of their choice. Many of the largest CSPs develop their own, bespoke premises hardware for their subscribers. For CSPs who elect to develop their own hardware, EXOS is an ideal software platform for delivering smart home services faster than their competition. To meet the needs of service providers who desire a fully integrated solution, EXOS is available on the GigaSpire family of hardware. The GigaSpire is currently available in two models - the GigaSpire BLAST and the GigaSpire MAX. 
As the first carrier-class Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) systems, both GigaSpire models provide unsurpassed bandwidth throughput and wireless coverage across the subscriber premises. By integrating the latest Multi-User, Multiple-input and Multiple-output (MU-MIMO) technology, the GigaSpire is capable of supporting up to eight simultaneous, symmetrical data streams to dramatically expand network capacity and improve efficiency. The latest security capabilities are integrated into the GigaSpire at both the hardware and software levels. With Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) integrated into the chipset, the GigaSpire can create a digital “fingerprint” for each system that can't be replicated or “spoofed”. These capabilities ensure network authentication at the gateway. The advanced instrumentation built into the GigaSpire also provides telemetry, performance and behavioral analytics that CSPs can leverage through the Calix Cloud to ensure that performance is optimized across the network and at the device level.
The GigaSpire MAX is a smart home service enablement platform designed to master the complexity of the subscriber edge and provide universal IoT support. The GigaSpire MAX integrates the latest IoT protocols - Zigbee, Z-Wave, combo Bluetooth Low-Energy and Bluetooth Classic. This integration enables a CSP to offer the IoT services of their choice from the major IoT 
11

brands or through their own branded IoT bundles and packages. The GigaSpire MAX offers fully integrated Alexa Voice Services, or AVS. With AVS, CSPs can offer the world’s leading cloud-enabled voice service and deliver an experience that meets growing subscriber expectations for voice interaction. As their subscribers interact directly with the EXOS powered GigaSpire Smart Home system, the CSP’s brand is brought into a central place in the subscriber’s experience - reinforcing the CSP’s brand as the provider of advanced smart home services.

AXOS Platform
AXOS is a software platform built for the specific needs of the access network. The AXOS platform is an architecture built to leverage the best of data center software design and network virtualization across the challenging and variable environment of the access network. With an always-on architecture and consistent provisioning services, a CSP can leverage AXOS to deliver all services on a single, elastic, converged access network that is always on. By supporting all existing and next generation PON architectures (anyPON), any silicon chipset (anyPHY) and any CSP operating model (anySDN), AXOS provides unmatched flexibility to our customers. Over 200 Calix customers are already deploying AXOS to simplify their operations, network and business models.
Representation that summarizes the primary benefits delivered by AXOS:
We believe AXOS offers a revolutionary way for CSPs to operate their access networks and accelerate their business transformation. AXOS achieves this because it is architected with discrete software modules that operate on top of a unique hardware abstraction layer that preserves software independence from the underlying hardware. This architecture simplifies upgrades to non-events, supports stateful, self-healing operation and facilitates virtualization of processes and services. All 
12

components within AXOS utilize standards based YANG data models to represent the operational functions and the NETCONF protocol that enable AXOS-powered systems to fit into any open SDN orchestration and control framework. Open, published APIs also allow customers to directly program unique network applications and services.
With AXOS, CSPs can collapse and automate networks functions such as subscriber management and routing to streamline deployment of services and simplify operations. This functionality is supported via software modules including AXOS RPm (Routing Protocol module), AXOS SMm (Subscriber Management module) and connectors such as SMx (Service Management Connector), AXOS DPx (virtualized DOCSIS connector), AXOS OFx (OpenFlow connector) and AXOS Sandbox - an SDA virtual environment for system design and testing. The recently announced AXOS Intelligent Access Edge solution includes the AXOS RPm and SMm as well as the new Advanced Routing Protocol Module (ARm) that provides CSPs with the flexibility to bring Layer 3 functionality-including multiprotocol label switching, or MPLS, routed networking-to their new or existing Layer 2 access network. This revolutionary new solution will simplify network architectures and reduce total cost of ownership. This solution will include a new line card for the E9-2 Intelligent Edge System that will aggregate Layer 2 OLTs and deliver the functionality and benefits of the Layer 3 Access network to the access edge.
The AXOS platform removes the complexity of network deployments by reducing the need to utilize middleware to integrate costly hardware and software. AXOS offers CSPs a path to the simplified, intelligent, unified access network that can accelerate time-to-revenue, increase service velocity, eliminate service disruptions and reduce total cost of ownership. As a result, CSPs can simplify their business models and focus investment and resources on revenue generating services and functions.
AXOS is currently implemented in our E-Series family of modular, non-blocking systems including the E9-2, E7-2, E3-2, E3-16F, E5-16F and E5 business systems. By offering AXOS on the entire E-Series family of systems, Calix enables our customers to meet a wide variety of deployment scenarios. The Calix Access system portfolio is designed for high availability and purpose-built for the demands of access network deployments. Our access systems are built and tested to meet or exceed network equipment-building system standards, which are a set of safety, spatial and environmental design guidelines for communications equipment. Our products are highly compatible and designed to be easily integrated into the existing operational and management infrastructure of CSP access networks.

Customers
We operate a differentiated customer engagement model that focuses on direct alignment with our customers through sales, service and support. In order to allocate our product development and sales efforts efficiently, we believe that it is critical to target markets, customers and applications deliberately. We have traditionally targeted CSPs, which own, build and upgrade their own access networks and value strong relationships with their systems and software suppliers.
The United States Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier, or ILEC, market is composed of three distinct “tiers” of carriers, which we categorize based on their subscriber line counts and geographic coverage. Tier 1 CSPs are very large with wide geographic footprints. They have greater than seven million subscriber lines, and they generally correspond with the former Regional Bell Operating Companies. Tier 2 CSPs also operate typically within a wide geographic footprint but are smaller in scale with subscriber line counts that range from approximately half a million to approximately seven million subscriber lines. Their service coverage areas are predominantly regional in scope, and therefore they are often known as Regional Local Exchange Carriers. Tier 3 CSPs consist primarily of over 1,000 predominantly local operators (often called IOCs) typically focused on a single community or a cluster of communities, although they also include a growing number of municipalities, electric cooperatives, fiber overbuilders and wireless ISPs. These entities range in size from a few hundred to approximately half a million subscriber lines.
To date, we have focused primarily on CSPs in the North American market. Our existing customers’ networks serve over 100 million subscriber lines. Our customers span Tiers 1, 2 and 3, including Allo Communications; CenturyLink, Inc., or CenturyLink; CityFibre Holdings Limited; City of Beverly Hills; Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company, or du; Cox Communications; Frontier Communications Corporation; Windstream Holdings, Inc., or Windstream; and Verizon Communications, Inc.
We have a few large customers who have represented a significant portion of our sales in any given period. CenturyLink accounted for 18% of total revenue in 2018, 31% in 2017 and 21% in 2016. Windstream accounted for less than 10% of our revenue in 2018 and 2017 and 15% of our revenue in 2016.
Sales to customers outside the United States represented approximately 12% of our total revenue in 2018, 11% in 2017 and 9% in 2016. Historically, our sales outside the United States were predominantly to customers in the Middle East, Canada, Europe and Caribbean.
Customer Engagement Model
We design, market and sell our Calix Cloud and software platforms, systems and Calix Services predominantly through our direct sales force, supported by marketing and product management personnel. We have expanded this model to include a small number of select channel partners in North America and dozens of international channel partners, who are part of our Fiber Forward Partner Program. Our sales effort is organized either by named accounts or regional responsibilities. Account teams comprise sales managers, supported by solution engineers and account managers, who work to target and sell to existing and prospective CSPs. The sales process includes analyzing CSPs’ existing networks and identifying how they can utilize our products and services within their networks. Even in circumstances where a channel partner is involved, our sales and marketing personnel are often selling side-by-side with the channel partner. We believe that our direct customer engagement 
15

approach provides us with significant differentiation in the customer sales process by aligning us more closely with our customers’ changing needs.
Research and Development
Continued investment in research and development is critical to our business. Our research and development team is composed of engineers with expertise in software, optics, wireless and hardware. Our teams of engineers are located in our San Jose and Petaluma facilities located in California; our Minneapolis, Minnesota facility and our Nanjing, China facility. We also outsource a portion of our software development to domestic and international third parties. Our research and development efforts are also extended by our co-development partnerships with third-party developers such as Infosys whereby we are able to utilize their substantially larger product development teams to bring cutting edge, software-based products to market while creating new revenue opportunities for both parties. Our research and development team is responsible for designing, developing and enhancing our Cloud and software platforms and systems, performing product and quality assurance testing and ensuring the compatibility of our products with third-party hardware and software products. We have made significant investments in the Calix portfolio. We intend to continue to dedicate significant resources to research and development to develop, enhance and deliver new platform features and capabilities, including investment in innovative technologies that support our business strategy.
Manufacturing
We rely substantially on CMs, ODMs and other third-party partners for the supply and distribution of our products. We work closely with these third parties to provide system design, source and procure materials, manufacture and deliver our products. Our manufacturing organization consists primarily of supply chain managers, new product introduction personnel and test engineers. We tightly integrate our supply chain management and new product introduction activities with the activities outsourced to these third parties. We have made changes to our supply chain management to align to our platform strategy and, more recently, in response to the imposition by the U.S. government of tariffs on goods imported from China. Such changes include increased leveraging of CM and ODM partners for systems design and management of raw materials used for manufacture and transition of global supply chain operations and activities to new geographies to mitigate the impact of the U.S. tariffs. Our relationships with our CMs and ODMs allow us to decrease new product introduction time, conserve working capital, reduce product costs and minimize delivery lead times while maintaining high product quality. Order fulfillment is performed by Pegasus Logistics Group, Inc. located in Texas. We also qualify and utilize other vendors for various portions of our supply chain from time to time, including order fulfillment of our circuit boards, optics and cabinets. This model allows us to operate with lower inventory levels while maintaining the ability to scale quickly to handle increased order volume.
Product reliability is essential for our customers, who place a premium on continuity of service for their subscribers. We perform rigorous in-house quality control testing to help ensure the reliability of our systems. Our internal manufacturing organization designs, develops and implements complex test processes to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products.
Our activities with our CM and ODM partners involve complexity and certain risks, including the potential absence of adequate capacity, the unavailability of or interruptions in access to certain process technologies and the reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs. As such, we may experience production problems or manufacturing delays. Additionally, shortages in components that we use in our systems are possible and our ability to predict the availability of such components may be limited. Our systems include components that are proprietary in nature and only available from a single source, as well as some components that are generally available from only a limited number of suppliers. Furthermore, lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in product specifications or delivery schedules. In some cases, significant time would be required to establish relationships with alternate suppliers or providers of proprietary components. We generally do not have long-term contracts that guarantee the supply of components or manufacturing services. Our ability to deliver products in a timely manner to our customers would be adversely impacted materially if we needed to qualify replacements for any of the components used in our systems. If we experience any difficulties in managing our relationships with our CMs, ODMs or other third party partners, or any interruption in either our own operations or those of our partners, or if a supplier is unable to meet our needs, we may encounter supply delays that could impede our ability to meet our customers’ requirements and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
Seasonality
Fluctuations in our revenue occur due to many factors, including the varying budget cycles and seasonal buying patterns of our customers. More specifically, our customers tend to spend less in the first fiscal quarter as they are finalizing their annual capital spending budgets, and in certain regions, customers are also challenged by winter weather conditions that inhibit outside fiber deployment.
16

Intellectual Property
Our success depends upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks as well as customary contractual protections. In addition, we generally control access to and the use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information. This protection is accomplished through a combination of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and through a combination of U.S. and international intellectual property laws.
As of December 31, 2018, we held 124 U.S. patents and had 7 pending U.S. patent applications. One of the U.S. patents is also covered by granted international patents in three countries. As of December 31, 2018, we had no pending international patent applications. U.S. patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing. We have added to our patent portfolio since our inception. The remaining terms on the individual patents vary from one to 19 years.
We rely on intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. U.S. patent, copyright and trade secret laws afford us only limited protection, and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and the issued patents may not be enforceable. Any infringement of proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in competitors offering similar products, resulting in the loss of our competitive advantage and decreased sales.
We believe that the frequency of assertions of patent infringement continues to increase in our industry. In particular, patent holders, including entities and organizations that purchase or hold patents to monetize such rights, assert patent infringement claims as a competitive tactic as well as a source of revenue. Any claim of infringement from a third party, even claims without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claims and could distract our management from operating our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. A judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.
Competition
The communications equipment market is highly competitive. Competition in this market is based on any one or a combination of the following factors:

• | functionality;


• | price;


• | existing business and customer relationships;


• | the ability of products and services, including turnkey professional services capabilities, to meet customers’ immediate and future network requirements;


• | product quality;


• | installation capability;


• | service and support;


• | scalability; and


• | manufacturing capability.

We compete with a number of companies within markets that we serve, and we anticipate that competition will intensify. Suppliers with which we compete include ADTRAN, Inc., or ADTRAN; Arris Group, Inc. (being acquired by CommScope Inc.); Casa Systems; Ciena Corporation; Cisco Systems Inc.; DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc.; Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.; Juniper Networks Inc.; Nokia Corporation and ZTE Corporation. There are also a number of smaller companies with which we compete in various geographic or vertical markets. While most of these smaller competitors lack broad national scale and product portfolios, they can offer strong competition on a deal-by-deal basis. As we expand into adjacent markets, we expect to encounter new competitors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition, manufacturing capacity and technical, financial and marketing resources as well as better established relationships with CSPs than we do. Many of our competitors have greater resources to develop products or pursue acquisitions and more experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for their products and technologies. In addition, a number of 
17

our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at below market pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed a total of 802 employees, of which 623 employees were located in the United States. Our United States employees are not represented by a labor union with respect to their employment with us. Our French employee is subject to a collective bargaining arrangement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
