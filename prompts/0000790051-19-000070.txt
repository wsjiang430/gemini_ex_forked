Our Company website is www.carlisle.com, through which we make available, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10‑K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10‑Q and Current Reports on Form 8‑K and all amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All references to "Notes" refer to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Strategy

We strive to be the market leader of highly‑engineered products in the various markets we serve. Under Vision 2025, our key pillars include: being dedicated to driving above market growth, utilizing the Carlisle Operating System (“COS”) consistently to drive efficiencies and operating leverage, building scale with synergistic acquisitions, continuing to invest in and develop exceptional talent and deploying capital into capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends.
We utilize COS, an operating structure and strategy deployment system based on lean enterprise and six sigma principles, to drive improving operational performance. COS is a continuous improvement process that defines the way we do business. Waste is eliminated and efficiencies are improved enterprise wide, allowing us to increase overall profitability. Improvements are not limited to production areas, as COS is also driving improvements in new product innovation, engineering, supply chain management, warranty and product rationalization. COS has created a culture of continuous improvement across all aspects of our business operations.
See Description of Business by Segment below for a more detailed discussion of our Vision 2025 strategy.

As noted above, a significant part of our strategy is to build scale with synergistic acquisitions. Synergies considered in making an acquisition include consolidation opportunities, technology, customer dispersion, operating capabilities and earnings growth potential. We acquired four businesses during 2018, which complement our existing Carlisle Construction Materials (“CCM”) and Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (“CIT”) segments. In addition, on January 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Petersen Aluminum Corporation ("Petersen") through our CCM segment (refer to Note 20).
We also pursue the sale of a business when it is determined they no longer fit within the Company’s long‑term goals or strategy. Accordingly, on March 20, 2018, we completed the sale of our Carlisle FoodService Products ("CFS") segment to The Jordan Company for $758.0 million (refer to Note 4).
For more details regarding acquisitions of the Company’s businesses during the past three years, refer to Note 3.

Description of Businesses by Segment

Carlisle Construction Materials (“CCM”)

Products, Markets and Locations
The CCM segment is a market leader in designing, manufacturing and selling thermoplastic polyolefin (“TPO”), ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (“EPDM”) and polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) membrane and metal roofing systems. CCM also manufactures and distributes energy‑efficient rigid foam insulation panels for all roofing applications. Roofing materials and insulation are sold together in warranted systems or separately in non-warranted systems to the new construction, re-roofing and maintenance, general construction and industrial markets. The roofing materials, including insulation, are primarily sold under the SynTec, Versico and Hunter Panels product lines in the United States of America (“U.S.” or “United States”) and throughout the world and, in addition, the Resitrix and Hertalan product lines in Europe. The segment manufactures and sells liquid and spray‑applied waterproofing membranes, vapor and air barriers and HVAC duct sealants and hardware for the commercial and residential construction markets through its coatings and waterproofing operation. The segment manufactures block molded expanded polystyrene for a variety of end markets, predominantly roofing and waterproofing through its Insulfoam product line. CCM also offers a broad range of polyurethane products and solutions across a broad diversity of markets and applications. CCM operates manufacturing facilities located throughout the United States, its primary market, and in Germany, the Netherlands and Romania. The majority of CCM’s products are sold through a network of authorized sales representatives and distributors.
Key Raw Materials
Key raw materials for this segment include methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (“MDI”), polyol, EPDM polymer, TPO polymer, carbon black and coated steel. These raw materials generally have at least two vendor sources to better assure adequate supply. The vendor typically has multiple processing facilities for key raw materials that are single sourced.
Seasonality and Working Capital
Revenues and earnings for CCM have historically been higher in the second and third quarters due to increased construction activity during those periods from favorable weather conditions.

The working capital practices for this segment include:


• | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 45 days to 90 days.


• | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.


• | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand.

Customer Concentration and Competition
CCM serves a large and diverse customer base; however, in 2018 two of CCM's largest customers represented 18.4% and 14.2% of this segment’s revenues. One of these customers also represented 11.8% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. The loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse effect on this segment’s revenues and operating income. Backlog orders are not considered a significant factor of CCM’s business and were $90.1 million and $64.7 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively; however, not all of these orders are firm in nature. All orders are reasonably expected to be filled in 2019.
This segment faces competition from numerous competitors that produce roofing, insulation and waterproofing products for commercial and residential applications. The level of competition within this market varies by product line. As one of four major manufacturers in the single‑ply industry, CCM competes through innovative products, long‑term warranties and customer service. CCM offers separately‑priced extended warranty contracts on certain of its products ranging from five to 40 years, the most significant being those offered on its installed single-ply roofing systems, subject to certain exclusions, covers leaks in the roofing system attributable to a problem with the particular product or the installation of the product. The building owner must have the roofing system installed by an independent authorized roofing contractor trained by CCM to install its roofing systems in order to qualify for the warranty.
Vision 2025 Strategy
Our strategy under Vision 2025 for the CCM segment is to:

• | Maintain its above average margin profile;

Customer Concentration and Competition
CIT serves a large and diverse customer base; however, in 2018 one customer represented 10.7% of this segment’s revenues but did not represent 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on this segment’s revenues and operating income. Backlog orders were $319.2 million and $299.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively; however, not all of these orders are firm in nature. Of 
the $319.2 million in backlog orders as of December 31, 2018, $13.8 million is not reasonably expected to be filled in 2019.
