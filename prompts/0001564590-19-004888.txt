OVERVIEW
 We are a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on leveraging the power of the body’s innate and adaptive immune responses through toll-like receptor (“TLR”) stimulation. Our first commercial product, HEPLISAV-B® (Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant), Adjuvanted), is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for prevention of infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus in adults age 18 years and older. We commenced commercial shipments of HEPLISAV-B in January 2018. In March 2018, we received regulatory approval of the pre-filled syringe (“PFS”) presentation of HEPLISAV-B. Our development efforts are primarily focused on stimulating the innate immune response to treat cancer in combination with other immunomodulatory agents. Our lead investigational immuno-oncology product candidates are SD-101, currently being evaluated in Phase 2 clinical studies, and DV281, in a Phase 1 safety study. 
 our technology
 Toll-like Receptor Immune Modulation Platform
 Toll-like receptors are a family of transmembrane proteins that play a vital role in innate immunity and subsequent adaptive immunity. Signaling through these receptors is triggered by the binding of a variety of pathogen-associated molecules and is essential to generation of innate immunity. The innate immune response is, in effect, the first line of defense against viruses, bacteria and other potential pathogens. The innate response also initiates and regulates the generation of an adaptive immune response composed of highly specific antibodies and T cells. Our research is focused primarily on stimulation of a subset of TLRs that have evolved to recognize bacterial and viral nucleic acids.
 Our research has resulted in the identification of proprietary synthetic oligonucleotides (short segments of DNA), that mimic the activity of microbial DNA and selectively activate one of these important receptors, TLR9. These are called CpG oligonucleotides – CpGs for short – referring to the presence of specific nucleotide sequences containing the CG base pair. In addition, we are developing compounds that activate two other important innate receptors, TLR7 and TLR8. These TLR agonists are able to stimulate or modify immune responses as single agents and can synergize with other classes of immunotherapeutic agents. In combination with tumor antigens or vaccines, these TLR agonists can substantially enhance and prolong protective immune responses. Thus, this portfolio of novel and potent activators opens multiple potential opportunities for expanding the scope of cancer immunotherapy, enhancing the efficiency of vaccines and modulating allergic diseases.

HEPLISAV-B 
 The Company's first commercial product, HEPLISAV-B (Hepatitis B Vaccine, (Recombinant), Adjuvanted), is approved by the FDA for prevention of infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus in adults age 18 years and older.  
 4

HEPLISAV-B combines 1018, our proprietary TLR9 agonist adjuvant, and recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (“rHBsAg” or “HBsAg”) that is manufactured by Dynavax GmbH, our wholly-owned subsidiary, in Düsseldorf, Germany. In Phase 3 trials, HEPLISAV-B demonstrated higher rates of protection with fewer doses than another currently approved hepatitis B vaccine and a similar adverse event profile. HEPLISAV-B is the only two-dose hepatitis B vaccine for adults approved in the U.S.
 About Hepatitis B
 Hepatitis B is a viral disease of the liver that can become chronic and lead to cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer and death. Hepatitis B virus is an extremely infectious and potentially deadly virus. It can be spread through the exchange of body fluids such as semen or blood, and is 50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV.
 Hepatitis B can be either acute or chronic. Acute hepatitis B virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first six months after exposure to the hepatitis B virus. Acute infection can — but does not always — lead to chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the hepatitis B virus remains in a person’s body. 
 There is no cure for hepatitis B, but the disease can be prevented through effective vaccination. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) have set a goal to eliminate all viral hepatitis infections, including hepatitis B, globally by 2030, and are calling for a continued commitment to increase services to eliminate hepatitis. 
 Worldwide, an estimated 257 million people are living with hepatitis B, including at least 850,000 in the United States, where an estimated 21,000 new infections occur each year.
 In adults, sexual transmission of hepatitis B may occur, particularly in unvaccinated men who have sex with men and heterosexual persons who have multiple sex partners or contact with sex workers. Transmission of the virus may also occur through the reuse of needles and syringes either in healthcare settings or among persons who inject drugs. Infection also can occur during medical, surgical and dental procedures, through tattooing or the use of razors contaminated with infected blood. 
 Prevention in Adults with Effective Vaccination 
 Adult vaccination to prevent hepatitis B is recommended by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (“ACIP”) for many at-risk populations, including certain healthcare and public safety workers, people with diabetes and travelers. The ACIP recommendation includes adults with the following risks:

• | Environmental Related Risk - Health care and first responders, travelers, persons who are in close contact with hepatitis B infected patients, residents and staff of facilities for developmentally disabled and those who work with HBV-infected primates or HBV in the lab;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased Risk or Severity of Disease due to Chronic Conditions - Adults with diabetes, end stage renal disease, HIV and chronic liver disease;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Behavioral Risk – Men who have sex with men, persons with multiple sex partners, STD clinic patients, inmates, IV drug users.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection Against Hepatitis B
 The approval of HEPLISAV-B was based on data from three Phase 3 non-inferiority trials of nearly 10,000 adult participants who received HEPLISAV-B. These pivotal studies compared HEPLISAV-B administered in two doses over one month to Engerix-B® administered in three doses over a six-month schedule. Results from HBV-23, the largest Phase 3 trial, which included 6,665 participants, showed that HEPLISAV-B demonstrated a statistically significantly higher rate of protection of 95% compared with 81% for Engerix-B. Across the three clinical trials, the most common local reaction was injection site pain (23% to 39%). The most common systemic reactions were fatigue (11% to 17%) and headache (8% to 17%). 
 5

Commercialization of HEPLISAV-B in the United States
 Dynavax has worldwide commercial rights to HEPLISAV-B. There are three other vaccines approved for the prevention of hepatitis B in the U.S.: Engerix-B and Twinrix® from GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”) and Recombivax-HB® from Merck & Co. (“Merck”).
 We commenced shipments of HEPLISAV-B in January 2018. Currently, total U.S. gross sales for adult hepatitis B vaccines is approximately $300 million annually. We are currently targeting approximately 25% of the total vaccine outlets, which we believe represent approximately 75% of hepatitis B vaccine sales in the U.S., with our field sales force team of approximately 60 people across 10 regions. We plan on converting our independent contractor field sales force team into Dynavax employees in the second quarter of 2019.
 In late 2012 the ACIP expanded its recommendation for adults who should be vaccinated against hepatitis B to include people with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2). According to the CDC there are 20 million adults diagnosed with diabetes and another 1.5 million new cases diagnosed each year. This population represents a significant increase in the number of adults recommended for vaccination against hepatitis B in the U.S.

 Immuno-oncology
 Immuno-oncology is a rapidly advancing field that focuses on modulating the immune system to develop or enhance anti-tumor activities in order to control growth or eliminate tumors. The industry is exploring multiple strategies and technologies aimed at enhancing and prolonging anti-tumor immune responses and inhibiting the actions of multiple immune checkpoints that limit the effectiveness of anti-tumor responses. Agents that inhibit two of these immune checkpoints, CTLA-4 and the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, have been approved for a number of cancer indications. These checkpoint inhibitors represent a major advance in cancer treatment, yet a majority of patients fail to respond to these inhibitors used as single agents. In many instances, it appears that the failure to respond correlates with anti-tumor activity that remains inadequate even with checkpoint blockade. Thus, a major opportunity in immuno-oncology is the development of immunostimulatory approaches that increase the number, location and functional state of tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cells, enabling remission and durable control of tumor growth.
 6

Through our expertise in TLR biology we have designed compounds that stimulate multiple innate mechanisms, activating a cascade of anti-tumor activities including stimulating the tumor microenvironment, generating tumor specific T cells and initiating a systemic distribution of those cells to all tumor sites. These compounds were specifically designed to stimulate multiple pathways of tumor killing through type 1 interferon induction and highly efficient stimulation of antigen presenting functions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells.
 Our clinical development strategy for immuno-oncology applications is based on two key principles. The first is that immune activation by TLR agonists will be significantly more effective when focused on the tumor than when administered as a systemic therapy. This has been shown in many studies with mouse tumor models and has been confirmed in pioneering academic studies of intratumoral injection of CpGs in lymphoma patients. These studies indicate TLR9 stimulation applied locally allows optimal concentrations of the CpG to be achieved at the site of highest concentrations of tumor antigens and T cells that recognize those antigens. Local stimulation of innate anti-tumor mechanisms, such as Natural Killer cells, should enhance release of tumor antigens and locally induced chemokine gradients can lead to enhanced recruitment of additional tumor-reactive T cells.
 The second principle is the development of combinations that have complementary mechanisms of action and have the potential for synergistic, rather than additive clinical effects. An example is our development of combination treatment of intra-tumoral SD-101 with the PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab releases anti-tumor T cells from one of the most potent of the immune checkpoints, while intratumoral SD-101 generates both greater numbers and more highly functional cytotoxic T cells directed against tumor cells. We have published studies showing the mechanisms of this synergy in mouse tumor models.
 We are developing our initial immuno-oncology product candidates, SD-101 and DV281, to eventually be combined with a variety of immunotherapies when activation of an anti-tumor immune response is desirable. We are targeting combinations with checkpoint inhibitors that offer activities synergistic with TLR9 stimulation, with an initial focus on approved checkpoint inhibitors in indications that have generally low response rates and would provide a clear path to approval. As a result, in 2015, we began our first combination trial in metastatic melanoma with SD-101, our novel intratumoral TLR9 agonist, in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD1 therapy approved for metastatic melanoma, under a clinical collaboration with Merck. We have expanded this trial to include head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, another approved indication for KEYTRUDA. Under the terms of the agreement, Dynavax is sponsoring and funding the trial, Merck is supplying KEYTRUDA at no cost and the data and intellectual property are shared. Each party has agreed that during the term of the study, it will not conduct a combination study with any third party that involves the combination of the two classes of compounds. 
 We also are conducting a study of DV281 in lung cancer in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy and there are ongoing and planned studies to support our strategy to develop SD-101 and DV281 in combination with multiple checkpoint inhibitors and other agents in multiple indications. Studies sponsored by us include the following:
 SD-101 – TLR9 Agonist for intratumoral injection
 Our lead cancer immunotherapy candidate is SD-101, a C Class CpG TLR9 agonist that was selected for characteristics optimal for treatment of cancer, including high interferon induction. Directly injecting SD-101 into a tumor site optimizes its effect by ensuring proximity to tumor-specific antigens. In animal models, SD-101 demonstrated significant anti-tumor effects at both the injected site and at distant sites. 
 SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in Melanoma
 In October 2015, we initiated a Phase 1/2 multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety and potential efficacy of intratumoral SD-101 in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), in patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma. The study includes patients who have disease that is progressing while receiving an anti-PD-1 therapy and patients who are naïve to anti-PD-1 therapy. The primary endpoints of this dose-expansion/dose-finding study are safety and preliminary efficacy.
 Results from SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in Advanced Melanoma Patients Naïve to anti-PD-1/L1 therapy 
 In October 2018, we reported results from the Phase 1b/2 study on a total of 87 intention to treat (ITT) patients with advanced melanoma naïve to anti-PD-1/L1 therapy. The study compared two different doses of SD-101. In the study, 47 patients received ≤2 mg of SD-101 in up to four lesions and 40 patients received 8 mg in a single lesion. The results showed a 
 7

70% (33 out of 47 patients) overall response rate (ORR) in advanced melanoma patients who received the ≤ 2 mg dose of SD-101 and a 48% (19 out of 40 patients) ORR in the group receiving the 8 mg dose of SD-101. The ORR was similar for PD-L1 negative and PD-L1 positive tumors. The combination of SD-101 and KEYTRUDA remained well tolerated with adverse events related to SD-101 being transient, mild to moderate flu-like symptoms.
 Results from SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in Advanced Melanoma Patients Resistant/ Refractory to anti-PD-1/L1 therapy 
 In October 2018, we reported results from the Phase 1b/2 study in patients with advanced melanoma resistant/refractory to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. The results showed a 21% (six out of 29 patients) ORR in patients who received 8 mg in a single lesion. Responses were observed in both SD-101 injected and non-injected lesions. The combination of SD-101 and KEYTRUDA remained well tolerated with adverse events related to SD-101 being transient, mild to moderate flu-like symptoms. Approximately 25 additional patients are being enrolled to receive 2 mg per injection.
 SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
 Based on the initial results from the combination of SD-101 and KEYTRUDA in melanoma, we expanded the combination study with KEYTRUDA to include a Phase 2 trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancers. 
 In October 2018, we presented data from the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial. The results demonstrated a 27% (six out of 22 patients) ORR who received 8 mg in a single lesion. Responses were observed in both SD-101 injected and non-injected lesions. The combination of SD-101 and KEYTRUDA remained well tolerated with adverse events related to SD-101 being transient, mild to moderate flu-like symptoms. Approximately 25 additional patients are being enrolled to receive 2 mg per injection.
 SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (I-SPY2)
 In October 2018, we and Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative™ (QLHC) announced that the combination of SD-101 and KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) will be evaluated in a new randomized, investigational treatment arm for the ongoing I-SPY 2 TRIAL™ for neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced breast cancer.
 The I-SPY 2 TRIAL is a standing Phase 2 randomized, controlled, multicenter study with an innovative Bayesian adaptive design aimed to rapidly screen and identify promising new treatments in specific subgroups of women with newly-diagnosed, high-risk (high likelihood of recurrence), locally-advanced breast cancer (Stage II/III).
DV281 – Inhaled TLR 9 agonist for lung cancer
 Although we continue to advance the strategy of focused delivery of a CpG in studies with intratumoral injection of SD-101, there are many tumor types for which direct, repeated injection is not feasible. Non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) represents one such challenge. This major type of lung cancer is known to respond to a variety of immunotherapy approaches and several inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint pathway have been approved for NSCLC. Yet response rates to these agents remain low. A strategy for focused delivery to lung tumors is direct administration to the lung by inhalation. To accomplish this, we have developed DV281, a novel investigational TLR9 agonist designed specifically for focused delivery to primary lung tumors and lung metastases. DV281 is similar in biological activity and mechanism of action to SD-101, but has been optimized for administration as an aerosol. 
 Studies in preclinical animal models of lung cancer show that this direct delivery of DV281 to tumor-bearing lungs results in induction of interferons and cytokines and infiltration of T cells, responses similar to those observed after intratumoral injection of SD-101. Animal models also demonstrate synergy of inhaled DV281 with anti-PD1 antibodies in reducing tumor burden and generating a systemic and durable anti-tumor response. Inhaled DV281, delivered by a nebulizer, entered clinical trials for NSCLC, in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, in October, 2017. We are conducting the Phase 1 clinical study in subjects with advanced NSCLC to investigate the safety and tolerability of DV281 as monotherapy and in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor (nivolumab), and to identify a recommended dose for the expansion part of the study.

AZD1419 for Asthma
 AZD1419 is being developed for the treatment of asthma pursuant to a collaboration with AstraZeneca. AZD1419 is designed to change the basic immune response to environmental allergens, such as house dust and pollens, leading to prolonged reduction in asthma symptoms by converting the response from one primarily mediated by type-2 helper T cells to type-1 helper T cells. 
 In November, 2018, we were informed by our collaborator, AstraZeneca, that initial high-level results from a Phase 2a study indicate AZD1419 treatment was not associated with a statistically significant improvement in the time to loss of asthma control and therefore did not meet the primary endpoint of the study. The treatment appeared to be safe and well tolerated and the study confirmed activation of the TLR9 pathway. The proposed mechanism of action of AZD1419 is distinct from that of the other TLR9 agonists being developed by Dynavax for immuno-oncology and vaccine applications. AstraZeneca is in the process of reviewing the full data before deciding on the next steps for the AZD1419 program.
 Vaccine Adjuvants
 Our vaccine research to date has focused on the use of TLR9 agonists as novel adjuvants. Different TLR9 agonist molecules are taken up within different endosomes within target cells, stimulating different signaling pathways. CpG B-Class TLR9 agonists, such as our 1018 vaccine adjuvant, are selectively taken up by late endosomes (more mature endosomes also known as multivesicular bodies), resulting in signaling that leads to release of cytokines necessary for T cell activation and establishing long-term immunity but with modest induction of interferon alpha. TLR9 stimulation also helps generate memory T Helper 1 (“Th1”) cells that can stimulate the immune system to induce long-lasting effects. As a result, TLR9 adjuvanted vaccines induce a specific Th1 immune response and durable levels of protective antibodies. We are evaluating additional candidates to leverage our 1018 adjuvant in additional vaccines. We are also collaborating with the Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. to develop adjuvanted vaccines using 1018. Our initial joint program is an improved pertussis vaccine.   
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. In addition to seeking patent protection in the U.S., we generally file patent applications in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and additional foreign countries on a selective basis to further protect the inventions that we or our partners consider important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our intellectual property portfolio included over 30 issued U.S. patents, over 235 issued or granted foreign patents and over 55 additional owned or co-owned pending U.S. and foreign patent applications claiming compositions containing TLR agonists or antagonists, methods of use, and/or methods of manufacture thereof.
 We have two issued patents relating to certain uses of HEPLISAV-B that expire in 2032. We have issued patents expiring in 2023 and covering compositions such as SD-101 and their uses in the U.S. and in several major European and other countries. We anticipate we will be eligible for up to a five-year patent term extension with respect to SD-101. We own or have an exclusive license to U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications pending for each of our other product candidates and/or their uses. At present, it is not known or determinable whether patents will issue from any of these applications or what the specific expiration dates would be for any patents that do issue. 
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued in the U.S. are effective for: 
  
• | the longer of 17 years from the issue date or 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, if the patent application was filed prior to June 8, 1995; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, if the patent application was filed on or after June 8, 1995.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The duration of patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is 20 years from the filing date. Our patent estate, based on patents existing now and expected by us to issue based on pending applications, will expire on dates ranging from 2018 to 2038.
 9

The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patents. 
 Because patent applications in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions typically are not published until 18 months after filing and publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in each of our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to invent and/or the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) may declare interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications and those of other parties or reexamination or reissue proceedings to determine if the scope of a patent should be narrowed. 
 Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. A number of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and research institutions, may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover inventions similar to the inventions owned or licensed to us. We cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to make, use or sell any products. If another party controls patents or patent applications covering our products, we may not be able to obtain the rights we need to those patents or patent applications in order to commercialize our products. One of our competitors, Merck, is an exclusive licensee of a number of broad patents covering HBsAg, a component of HEPLISAV-B. We have a non-exclusive license to those patents controlled by Merck, which was obtained in 2018. 
 Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope or validity of another party’s proprietary rights. The existence of third-party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection. For example, Pfizer, Inc. has issued U.S. and foreign patent claims as well as patent claims pending with the PTO and foreign patent offices that, if held to be valid, could require us to obtain a license in order to commercialize one or more of our formulations of TLR agonist other than with respect to HEPLISAV-B, for which we have a license. Litigation or any other proceedings, such as patent interferences, could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by us, and an adverse outcome in a court or patent office could subject us to significant liabilities, require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties, or require us to cease using some of our technology. We may not prevail in these actions or proceedings, if any. 
 In addition, other parties may duplicate, design around or independently develop similar or alternative technologies to ours or our licensors. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology. Although trade secrets are difficult to protect, wherever possible, we use confidential disclosure agreements to protect the proprietary nature of our technology. Our policy is to require each of our commercial partners, employees, consultants and advisors to enter into an agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us that in general provides that the individuals must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any of our confidential information developed or learned by the individuals during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements also generally provide that we own all inventions conceived by the individuals in the course of rendering their employment or services to us. However, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets and/or proprietary information will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.  
 COMPETITION 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Our products and development programs target a number of areas, including vaccine adjuvants, cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. There are many commercially available products for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Many companies and institutions are making substantial investments in developing additional products to treat these diseases that could compete directly or indirectly with our products under development. 
 HEPLISAV-B, a two-dose hepatitis B vaccine, competes directly with conventional three-dose marketed vaccines Engerix-B from GSK as well as Recombivax-HB marketed by Merck. There are also modified schedules of conventional 
 10

hepatitis B vaccines for limited age ranges that are approved in the European Union and U.S. In addition, HEPLISAV-B competes against Twinrix, a bivalent vaccine marketed by GSK for protection against hepatitis B and hepatitis A.
 Our cancer immunotherapy, SD-101, if developed, approved and commercialized will compete with a range of therapies being used or studied to treat blood cancers and solid tumor malignancies, including:
  
• | Chemotherapeutic agents;
--+-------------------------


• | Immuno-oncology agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti- CTLA4 and anti-PD1 antibodies, cytokines such as anti-IL2, immune stimulation therapies including agonists of TLR, STING and other innate immune recognition receptors; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Targeted therapies, such as BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors and BTK inhibitors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Oncolytic viral therapies such as IMLYGIC®
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Cancer vaccines such as mRNA for in vivo delivery
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Cell therapies such as autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and CAR-T products
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Approved and late-stage investigational cancer immunotherapeutics are marketed or being developed by numerous companies, including AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Gilead, Roche/Genentech, Nektar, Pfizer, Amgen, GSK, Regeneron, Novartis, AbbVie and Merck.
 We are in direct competition with a number of other companies developing TLR agonists as well as other mechanisms of action that are focused on stimulating the immune response. These companies include Aduro Biotech, Inc., Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Immune Design Corp., Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Mologen AG/Oncologie International.
 Many of the entities developing and marketing these competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative agreements with large, established companies with access to capital. These entities may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs. 
 REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose extensive requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, labeling, marketing, promotion, pricing, import, export, storage and distribution of biopharmaceuticals. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or foreign regulatory agency requirements may result in warning letters, fines, civil or criminal penalties, additional reporting obligations and/or agency oversight, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations and biologics additionally under the Public Health Service Act. The process required by the FDA before biopharmaceuticals may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests and pre-clinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 11

 
• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application or a biologics license application, NDA or BLA, depending on the nature of the product after completion of all pivotal clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the product for the indication for use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA to accept the application for review;

• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices regulations for pharmaceuticals, or cGMPs; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 The results of pre-clinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the thirty-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.
 Clinical Trials. For purposes of an NDA or BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap: 
  
• | Phase 1. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, typically in healthy humans, but in some cases in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA for a product candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product after approval under a post-marketing commitment or post- marketing requirement. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved a product. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For certain products and indications, the FDA may agree to an abbreviated clinical trial program in order to obtain approval. That is determined on a case-by-case basis and there is no guarantee for any product and/or indication that the FDA will agree to an abbreviated clinical trial program.

The results of biologic development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA. Applications also must contain extensive manufacturing and control information. Applications must be accompanied by a significant user fee. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, eight months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturer to ensure that the product can be reliably produced in compliance with cGMPs and will typically inspect certain clinical trial sites for compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of an application by issuing a Complete Response Letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time- consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. Approval may occur with boxed warnings on product labeling or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which limit the labeling, distribution or promotion of a product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products which have been commercialized and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 
 Other Regulatory Requirements. Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual product quality review, payment of program user fees and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight by the agency, import alert or possible civil or criminal penalties. The FDA may also require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval for that product. 
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of pharmaceuticals, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet, including certain social media activities. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental application, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as damages, fines, withdrawal of regulatory approval, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight by the agency, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products or operate our business and also adversely affect our financial results.  
 Physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available pharmaceuticals for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Additionally, a significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various U.S. federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for off-label uses and other sales practices. These investigations have alleged violations of various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, false claims laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. If our promotional activities, including any promotional activities that a contracted sales force may perform on our behalf, fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require corrective advertising or a recall 
 13

or institute fines or civil fines, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business. 
 Outside the United States, the ability of our partners and us to market a product is contingent upon obtaining marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country and region to region. 
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws. As a pharmaceutical company, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights may be applicable to our business. We may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations. These laws are applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA, such as us, and pharmacies, hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” is defined as any remuneration, direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind, and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute may have been violated, and enforcement will depend on the relevant facts and circumstances. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to state that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or to have offered improper inducements to federal health care program beneficiaries to select a particular provider or supplier. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad, and despite a series of narrow statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors. In addition, where such activities involve foreign government officials, they may also potentially be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our activities with physician customers, pharmacies, and patients, as well as our activities pursuant to partnerships with other companies and pursuant to contracts with contract research organizations, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 
 The federal criminal and civil false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, the ACA specified that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. The civil federal False Claims Act has been the basis for numerous enforcement actions and settlements by pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies in connection with various alleged financial relationships with customers. In addition, a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers have reached substantial financial settlements in connection with allegedly causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws, as might violations of the federal physician self-referral laws, such as the Stark laws, which prohibit a physician from making a referral to certain designated health services with which the physician or the physician’s family member has a financial interest and prohibit submission of a claim for reimbursement pursuant to the prohibited referral. The “qui tam” provisions of the civil False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted similar fraud and abuse statutes 
 14

or regulations, including, without limitation, false claims laws analogous to the civil False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 Separately, there are a number of other fraud and abuse laws that pharmaceutical manufacturers must be mindful of, particularly after a product candidate has been approved for marketing in the United States. For example, a federal criminal law enacted as part of, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. There are also federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. 
 Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws. We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. Among other things, HIPAA’s privacy and security standards are directly applicable to “business associates” — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. In addition to possible civil and criminal penalties for violations, HITECH created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. State laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Further, we are required to comply with international personal data protection laws and regulations, particularly as the result of our operations in Düsseldorf, Germany. Under the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR (EU) 2016/679, personal information about European Union (“E.U.”) citizens can only be transferred from the E.U. to countries with adequate data protection.
 “Sunshine” and Marketing Disclosure Laws. There are an increasing number of federal and state “sunshine” laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, and make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, a similar federal requirement, known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, requires manufacturers, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, to track and report annually to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The federal government discloses the reported information on a publicly available website. Certain states, such as Massachusetts, also make the reported information publicly available. In addition, there are state and local laws that require pharmaceutical representatives to be licensed and comply with codes of conduct, transparency reporting, and other obligations. These laws may adversely affect our sales, marketing, and other activities with respect to our products in the United States by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 Government Price Reporting. For those marketed products which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require products be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount such products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties. One component of the rebate and discount calculations under the Medicaid and 340B programs, respectively, is the “additional rebate,” a complex calculation which is based, in part, on the rate at which a branded drug price increases over time more than the rate of inflation (based on the CPI-U). This comparison is based on the baseline pricing data for the first full quarter of sales associated with a branded drug’s NDA, and baseline data cannot generally be reset, even on transfer of the NDA to another manufacturer. This “additional rebate” calculation can, in 
 15

some cases where price increase has been relatively high versus the first quarter of sales of the NDA, result in Medicaid rebates up to 100 percent of a drug’s “average manufacturer price” and 340B prices of one penny. 
 In General. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exception and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities in the United States could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Moreover, state governmental agencies may propose or enact laws and regulations that extend or contradict federal requirements. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the state or federal laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, sunshine, government price reporting, and fraud laws may prove costly.
Impact of Healthcare Reform and Recent Public Scrutiny of Specialty Drug Pricing on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing. In the United States and other potentially significant markets for our products, federal and state authorities as well as third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average net selling prices. Further, there is increased scrutiny of prescription drug pricing practices by federal and state lawmakers and enforcement authorities. In addition, there is an emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States, which will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. 
 The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs (including a number of proposals pertaining to prescription drugs, specifically), improving quality and/or expanding access. For example, in Massachusetts, the MassHealth program has requested permission from the federal government to use commercial tools, such as a closed formulary, to negotiate more favorable rebate agreements from drug manufactures. There also has been particular and increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices, particularly with respect to drugs that have been subject to relatively large price increases over relatively short time periods. Such interest has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product, and on January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, may affect rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. While some of these, and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump 
 16

administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, in California, effective January 1, 2019, drug companies must notify insurers and government regulators of certain price increases and provide an explanation of the reasons for such increases. 
 In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, for example, the ACA. The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our b
usiness. 
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
 Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to two percent per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Such laws, and others that may affect our business that have been recently enacted or may in the future be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. 
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, and the Right to Try Act does not invalidate currently existing expanded access programs. 
 MANUFACTURING
 We rely on our facility in Düsseldorf, Germany and third parties to perform the multiple processes involved in manufacturing our product candidates, including the manufacturing of TLR agonists, antigens, and the formulation, fill and 
 17

finish of the resultant products. We have relied on a limited number of suppliers to produce products for clinical trials and a single supplier to produce our 1018 for HEPLISAV-B. In order to successfully manufacture and commercialize HEPLISAV-B, we have secured long term supply agreements with the key third party suppliers and vendors for supply of product for commercialization. To date, we have manufactured only small quantities of TLR agonists ourselves for development purposes. We currently manufacture the HBsAg for HEPLISAV-B at our Dynavax GmbH facility. 
 COMMITMENT TO COMPLIANCE AND ENVIRONMENT
 We are committed to conducting our business in compliance with all applicable legal and ethical standards. In addition, we are committed to helping to protect the environment.  
 Our Ethics and Compliance program includes our Code of Business Conduct (“Code”), which sets forth our expectations of all Dynavax employees globally that they conduct their business activities in a legal and ethical manner. The Code can be found on Dynavax.com under the header “Investor Relations” and within that under the header “Corporate Governance and Compliance.” We have a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, a Compliance Steering Committee and policies, procedures and training addressing specific aspects of our business, including advertising and promotion; engagements with healthcare providers; and regarding our business activities outside the United States to ensure they comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all other applicable anti-corruption laws. We certify on an annual basis to having a comprehensive compliance program that meets the standards set forth under California law. This certification, which sets forth all of the elements of our healthcare compliance program, can be found on our web-site.
 We also care about the environment. To that end, the building we are moving into later this year is being designed to be scored as no less than a “Gold” level on the LEED Scorecard as set forth by the United States Green Building Committee. Additionally, the facility is located adjacent to an expansive public transit center, and the Company offers incentives to employees to utilize public transit in order to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. We also allow our employees to telecommute one or more days a week, depending on the nature of their role, which further helps reduce congestion and pollution. In addition, we have an active recycling program. We continue to consider other ways in which we can conduct our business in an environmentally friendly manner.
 We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures for environmental compliance and protection. We do not expect that expenditures for compliance with environmental laws will have a material effect on our results of operations in the future.
