ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
The Corporation
Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") is a corporate agency and instrumentality of the United States ("U.S.") that was created in 1933 by federal legislation in response to a proposal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  TVA was created to, among other things, improve navigation on the Tennessee River, reduce the damage from destructive flood waters within the Tennessee River system and downstream on the lower Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, further the economic development of TVA's service area in the southeastern United States, and sell the electricity generated at the facilities TVA operates. Today, TVA operates the nation's largest public power system and supplies power to a population of nearly 10 million people.
TVA manages the Tennessee River, its tributaries, and certain shorelines to provide, among other things, year-round navigation, flood damage reduction, and affordable and reliable electricity.  TVA also manages the river system to provide recreational opportunities, adequate water supply, improved water quality, natural resource protection, and economic development.  TVA performs these management duties in cooperation with other federal and state agencies that have jurisdiction and authority over certain aspects of the river system.  In addition, the TVA Board of Directors (the "TVA Board") has established two councils — the Regional Resource Stewardship Council and the Regional Energy Resource Council — to advise TVA on its stewardship activities in the Tennessee Valley and its energy resource activities.
Initially, all TVA operations were funded by federal appropriations.  Direct appropriations for the TVA power program ended in 1959, and appropriations for TVA's stewardship, economic development, and multipurpose activities ended in 1999.   Since 1999, TVA has funded all of its operations almost entirely from the sale of electricity and power system financings. TVA's power system financings consist primarily of the sale of bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness (collectively, "Bonds") and secondarily of alternative forms of financing, such as lease arrangements.  As a wholly-owned government corporation, TVA is not authorized to issue equity securities.

Service Area
TVA's service area, the area in which it sells power, is defined by the TVA Act. TVA supplies power in most of Tennessee, northern Alabama, northeastern Mississippi, and southwestern Kentucky and in portions of northern Georgia, western North Carolina, and southwestern Virginia. Under the TVA Act, subject to certain minor exceptions, TVA may not, without the enactment of authorizing federal legislation, enter into contracts that would have the effect of making it, or the wholesale customers that distribute TVA power ("local power company customers" or "LPCs"), a source of power supply outside the area for which TVA or its LPCs were the primary source of power supply on July 1, 1957.  This provision is referred to as the "fence" because it bounds TVA's sales activities, essentially limiting TVA to power sales within a defined service area.
Note
See Power Supply and Load Management Resources.
In addition, the Federal Power Act ("FPA") includes a provision that helps protect TVA's ability to sell power within its service area.  This provision, called the "anti-cherrypicking" provision, prevents the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") from ordering TVA to provide access to its transmission lines to others to deliver power to customers within TVA's defined service area.  As a result, the anti-cherrypicking provision reduces TVA's exposure to loss of its customers.
In 2019, the revenues generated from TVA's electricity sales were $11.2 billion and accounted for virtually all of TVA's revenues. See Note 17 — Revenue for details regarding revenues by state for each of the last three years.

Customers
TVA is primarily a wholesaler of power, selling power to LPCs that then resell power to their customers at retail rates.  TVA's LPCs consist of (1) municipalities and other local government entities ("municipalities") and (2) customer-owned entities ("cooperatives").  These municipalities and cooperatives operate public power electric systems whose primary purpose is not to make a profit but to supply electricity to the general public or the cooperatives' members.  TVA also sells power directly to certain end-use customers, primarily large commercial and industrial loads and federal agencies with loads larger than 5,000 kilowatts ("kW"). Whether TVA or an LPC serves a new power customer is determined by the applicable TVA-LPC wholesale power contract. Each contract contains a formula that balances the size of the LPC and the amount of any TVA infrastructure investment to determine which party is entitled to serve the new customer.  In addition, power in excess of the needs of the TVA system may, where consistent with the provisions of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 (the "TVA Act"), be sold under exchange power arrangements with other specific electric systems. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Financial Results — Operating Revenues. See Note 17 — Revenue for details regarding operating revenues for each of the last three years.
Local Power Companies
Revenues from LPCs accounted for approximately 91 percent of TVA's total operating revenues in 2019.  At September 30, 2019, TVA had wholesale power contracts with 154 LPCs.  Each of these contracts requires the LPC to purchase from TVA all of the electric power required for service to the LPC's customers. LPCs purchase power under contracts with terms that range from five to 20 years to terminate. 
TVA's two largest LPCs — Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division ("MLGW") and Nashville Electric Service ("NES") — have contracts with a five-year and a 20-year termination notice period, respectively.  Sales to MLGW and NES accounted for nine percent and eight percent, respectively, of TVA's total operating revenues in 2019.
TVA and LPCs continue to work together to meet the changing needs of consumers around the Tennessee Valley. At its August 2019 meeting, the TVA Board approved a 20-year Partnership Agreement option that better aligns the length of LPC contracts with TVA's long-term commitments. Participating LPCs will receive benefits including a 3.1 percent wholesale bill credit in exchange for their long-term commitment, which enables TVA to recover its long-term financial commitments over a commensurate period. As of September 30, 2019, 131 LPCs had signed the 20-year Partnership Agreement with TVA, which represents 56 percent of total operating revenues in 2019.
The power contracts between TVA and LPCs provide for the purchase of power by LPCs at the wholesale rates established by the TVA Board.  Under the TVA Act, the TVA Board is authorized to regulate LPCs to carry out the purposes of the TVA Act through contract terms and conditions as well as through rules and regulations. TVA regulates LPCs primarily through the provisions of TVA's wholesale power contracts.  All of the power contracts between TVA and the LPCs require that power purchased from TVA be sold and distributed to the ultimate consumer without discrimination among consumers of the same class and prohibit direct or indirect discriminatory rates, rebates, or other special concessions.  In addition, there are a number of wholesale power contract provisions through which TVA seeks to ensure that the electric system revenues of the LPCs are used only for electric system purposes.  Furthermore, almost all of these contracts specify the resale rates and charges at which the LPC must resell TVA power to its customers.  These rates are revised from time to time, subject to TVA approval, to reflect changes in costs, including changes in the wholesale cost of power.  
TVA also regulates LPC policies for customer deposits, termination of service for non-payment, information to consumers, and billing through a service practice policy framework. TVA's regulatory framework provides for consistent regulatory policy for ratepayers across the Tennessee Valley, while recognizing local considerations. The regulatory provisions in TVA's wholesale power contracts are designed to carry out the objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective of providing for adequate supply of power at the lowest feasible rates. See Rates — Rate Methodology below.
Other Customers
Revenues from directly served industrial customers accounted for approximately six percent of TVA's total operating revenues in 2019.  Contracts with these customers are subject to termination by the customer or TVA upon a minimum notice period that varies according to a number of factors, including the customer's contract demand and the period of time service has been provided. TVA also serves seven federal customers, ‎including U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") facilities and military installations, which accounted for approximately one percent of TVA's total operating revenues in 2019.
Other Revenue
Other revenue consists primarily of wheeling and network transmission charges, sales of excess steam that is a by-product of power production, delivery point charges for interconnection points between TVA and the customer, and certain other minor items. Other revenue accounted for approximately two percent of TVA's total operating revenues in 2019.

Rates
Rate Authority
The TVA Act gives the TVA Board sole responsibility for establishing the rates TVA charges for power. These rates are not subject to judicial review or to review or approval by any state or federal regulatory body. Under the TVA Act, TVA is required to charge rates for power that will produce gross revenues sufficient to provide funds for:

• | Operation, maintenance, and administration of its power system;


• | Payments to states and counties in lieu of taxes ("tax equivalents");


• | Debt service on outstanding indebtedness;


• | Payments to the U.S. Treasury in repayment of and as a return on the government's appropriation investment in TVA's power facilities (the "Power Program Appropriation Investment"); and


• | Such additional margin as the TVA Board may consider desirable for investment in power system assets, retirement of outstanding bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness (collectively, "Bonds") in advance of their maturity, additional reduction of the Power Program Appropriation Investment, and other purposes connected with TVA's power business, having due regard for the primary objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective that power shall be sold at rates as low as are feasible. See Note 18 — Proprietary Capital. 

TVA fulfilled its requirement to repay $1.0 billion of the Power Program Appropriation Investment in 2014; therefore, the repayment of this amount is no longer a component of rate setting.
Rate Methodology
TVA uses a seasonal time of use wholesale rate structure comprised of base demand and energy rates, a fuel rate, and a grid access charge ("GAC"). In setting the base rates, TVA uses a debt-service coverage ("DSC") methodology to derive annual revenue requirements in a manner similar to that used by other public power entities that also use the DSC rate methodology. Under the DSC methodology, rates are calculated so that an entity will be able to cover its operating costs and to satisfy its obligations to pay principal and interest on debt. This ratemaking approach is particularly suitable for use by entities financed primarily, if not entirely, by debt, such as TVA, and helps ensure that TVA produces gross revenues sufficient to fund requirements specified in the TVA Act listed under Rate Authority above.
TVA recovers fuel costs and tax equivalent payments associated with fuel cost adjustments through a monthly rate reflecting the forecasted costs of fuel. Beginning on October 1, 2018, fuel costs are allocated to three groups of customers: Standard Service (residential and small commercial customers), Large Manufacturing customers with contract demands greater than 5 megawatts ("MW"), and Large General Service customers with contract demands greater than 5 MW. Fuel costs are allocated to these three classes of customers in relation to their hourly loads and TVA's hourly incremental dispatch cost. Total monthly fuel costs include costs for natural gas, fuel oil, coal, purchased power, emission allowances, nuclear fuel, and other fuel-related commodities as well as realized gains and losses on derivatives purchased to hedge the costs of such commodities.
In recent years, TVA, LPCs, and directly served industries have worked collaboratively to develop changes to TVA's rate structures that focus on TVA's long-term pricing efforts. These changes are improving pricing by better aligning rates with underlying cost drivers and by sending improved pricing signals, while maintaining competitive industrial rates and keeping residential rates affordable. The rate structures are also designed to reduce wholesale energy rates for Standard Service and introduce a GAC at an offsetting rate to better recover fixed costs. This approach will more accurately reflect the wholesale cost of energy and recognize the value of the grid's reliability and associated fixed costs. TVA's modernized approach to pricing provides bill stability while maintaining reliability and fairness for all TVA's customers. 
Power Supply and Load Management Resources
General
TVA seeks to balance production capabilities with power supply requirements by promoting the conservation and efficient use of electricity and, when necessary, buying, building, or leasing assets or entering into power purchase agreements.  TVA also seeks to employ a diverse mix of energy generating sources and works toward obtaining greater amounts of its power supply from clean (low or zero carbon emitting) resources.
Power generating facilities operated by TVA at September 30, 2019, included three nuclear sites, 17 natural gas and/or oil-fired sites, six coal-fired sites, 29 conventional hydroelectric sites, one pumped-storage hydroelectric site, one diesel generator site, and 14 solar energy sites, although certain of these facilities were out of service as of September 30, 2019. See Item 2, Properties — Generating Properties — Net Capability for a discussion of these facilities.  TVA also acquires power under power purchase agreements of varying durations, including short-term contracts of less than 24-hours in duration. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Financial Results — Operating Expenses.

Purchased power (renewable) | 5% | 4% | 5% 

Note
(1) TVA's non-hydro renewable resources from TVA facilities are less than one percent for all periods shown, and therefore are not represented on the table above. Purchased power (renewable) contains the majority of non-hydro renewable energy supply.
Nuclear
At September 30, 2019, TVA had three nuclear sites consisting of seven units in operation.  The units at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant ("Browns Ferry") are boiling water reactor units, and the units at Sequoyah Nuclear Plant ("Sequoyah") and Watts Bar Nuclear Plant ("Watts Bar") are pressurized water reactor units.  Operating information for each of these units is included in the table below.

Note
(1) The summer net capability for Browns Ferry excludes the impact of the Extended Power Uprate project. The generating capability is expected to increase by an estimated 465 MW after sufficient run time to validate the new capacity.
Extended Power Uprate. On August 14, 2017, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") approved TVA's request for a 465 MW extended power uprate ("EPU") project at Browns Ferry. As of September 30, 2019, physical work on all units was complete and the generation capacity is expected to increase 465 MW after sufficient run time to validate the new capacity. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Generation Resources — Extended Power Uprate.
Other Nuclear Initiatives. TVA has submitted an Early Site Permit Application to the NRC to license small modular reactors ("SMRs") at TVA's Clinch River Site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Generation Resources — Small Modular Reactors.
Other Nuclear Matters. Operating nuclear facilities subjects TVA to waste disposal, decommissioning, and insurance requirements, as well as litigation risks. See Fuel Supply — Nuclear Fuel below for a discussion of spent nuclear fuel and low-level radioactive waste, Note 22 — Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies for a discussion of TVA's nuclear decommissioning liabilities and the related trust and nuclear insurance, and Note 22 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings for a discussion of legal and administrative proceedings related to TVA's nuclear program, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference.

Natural Gas and/or Oil-Fired
As of September 30, 2019, TVA's natural gas and oil-fired fleet consisted of 101 combustion turbine power blocks (86 simple-cycle units and 14 combined-cycle power units).  Sixty of the simple-cycle units are currently capable of quick-start response allowing full generation capability in approximately 10 minutes. The economic dispatch of natural gas-fired plants depends on both the day-to-day price of natural gas and the price of other available intermediate resources such as coal-fired plants. TVA uses simple-cycle units to meet peaking or backup power needs. TVA also uses cogeneration at one simple-cycle unit. TVA's 2019 Integrated Resource Plan ("IRP") projects significant solar expansion over the next decade. The natural gas-fired fleet supports that expansion by providing reliability across all hours, as well as the flexibility to help manage ramping and intermittency.
See Item 2, Properties — Generating Properties, Note 9, Note 10, and Note 13 for a discussion of lease arrangements into which TVA has entered in connection with certain combustion turbine units. Because of TVA's strategy of portfolio diversification and reduction of air emissions, TVA may decide to make further strategic investments in natural gas-fired facilities in the future by purchase, construction, or lease.
Coal-Fired
 As of September 30, 2019, TVA had six coal-fired plants consisting of 26 active units, accounting for 7,886 MW of summer net capability. TVA considers units to be in an active state when the unit is generating, available for service, or temporarily unavailable due to equipment failures, inspections, or repairs. All other coal-fired units are considered retired. During its August 2018 meeting, the TVA Board approved a plan to perform assessments of Bull Run Fossil Plant ("Bull Run") and Paradise Fossil Plant ("Paradise"). Results of these assessments were presented to the TVA Board at its February 2019 meeting, and the Board approved the retirement of Paradise Unit 3 by December 2020 and Bull Run by December 2023. Subsequent to the Board approval, TVA determined Paradise would not be restarted after January 2020 due to the plant's material condition.
Coal-fired plants have been subject to increasingly stringent regulatory requirements over the last few decades, including those under the Clean Air Act ("CAA"), the Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") Coal Combustion Residuals ("CCR") Rule, and the associated regulations.  TVA has committed to a programmatic approach for the evaluation of its sites where CCR is stored to meet all applicable state and federal regulations.  Increasing regulatory costs have caused TVA to consider whether to make the required capital investments to continue operating its coal-fired facilities.  See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Generation Resources — Coal Combustion Residual Facilities.
TVA is moving toward a more balanced generation plan with greater reliance on lower-cost and cleaner energy generation technologies. Since September 30, 2010, TVA has reduced its summer net capability of coal-fired units by 6,682 MW. The 2019 IRP indicated evaluation of additional coal unit retirements. Most of the remaining coal-fired plants are among the oldest in the nation still in operation, and their fit within TVA's power supply portfolio will be further tested in the future with increasing amounts of solar generation utilized by TVA. TVA's long-range plans will continue to consider the costs and benefits of significant environmental and other major capital investments at its remaining coal-fired plants.
Hydroelectric
Conventional Hydroelectric Dams. TVA maintains 29 conventional hydroelectric dams with 113 generating units throughout the Tennessee River system for the production of electricity.  As of September 30, 2019, these units accounted for 3,784 MW of summer net capability.  The amount of electricity that TVA is able to generate from its hydroelectric plants depends on a number of factors, including the amount of precipitation and runoff, initial water levels, generating unit availability, and the need for water for competing water management objectives.  When these factors are unfavorable, TVA must increase its reliance on higher cost generation plants and purchased power.  In addition, a portion of energy generated by nine U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("USACE") dams on the Cumberland River system contributes to the TVA power system.  See Weather and Seasonality below and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Dam Safety and Remediation Initiatives.
Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant.  As of September 30, 2019, TVA has four units at Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant ("Raccoon Mountain") with a total net summer capability of 1,616 MW. These units are utilized to balance the transmission system as well as generate power. TVA uses electricity generated by its fleet during periods of low demand to operate pumps that fill the reservoir at Raccoon Mountain. Then, during periods of high or peak demand, the water is released and the pumps reverse to work as power generating turbines. 
Hiwassee Hydro Unit 2.  Hiwassee Hydro Unit 2 has a unique reversible turbine/generator that acts as a pump and a turbine enhancing TVA's ability to balance baseload generation.  Hiwassee Hydro Unit 2 has a summer net capability of 86 MW.
Hydro Modernization Program. TVA is scheduled to complete the Hydro Modernization Program in 2020 with the completion of South Holston Unit 1 and Pickwick Landing Dam ("Pickwick") Unit 2. The Hydro Modernization Program began in 
13

1992 and focuses on units with potential to increase peaking capacity and improve reliability. As of September 30, 2019, modernization had been completed on 61 conventional hydroelectric units. The modernization projects resulted in 447 MW of increased capacity from the conventional hydroelectric units, with an average efficiency gain of approximately five percent. In 2019, TVA began its transition to a new program, the Hydro Major Maintenance Program, intended to focus on life extension and addressing reliability risks that will support the preservation of TVA's hydroelectric fleet capacity. Hydroelectric generation will continue to be an important part of TVA's energy mix.

Other Renewable Energy Resources

 TVA's renewable energy portfolio includes both TVA-owned assets and renewable energy purchases. TVA owns 14 solar sites with a total net summer capability of approximately 1 MW.
TVA tracks its renewable energy commitments and claims through the management of renewable energy certificates ("RECs"). The RECs, which each represent 1 MWh of renewable energy generation, are principally associated with wind, solar, biomass, and low-impact hydroelectric. TVA continues to evaluate ways to adjust to customer preferences and requirements for cleaner and greener energy, including the acquisition of RECs from renewable purchased power. These RECs can be sold to customers to meet their needs.
Diesel Generators
As of September 30, 2019, TVA had one diesel generator plant consisting of five units, and this facility accounted for 9
MW of summer net capability.
Distributed Energy Resources
Consumer desire for energy choice is, among other things, driving the expectation for flexible options in the electric industry. TVA and LPCs are working together to leverage the strengths of the Tennessee Valley public power model to provide economic, sustainable, and flexible distributed energy solutions. TVA will focus on the safety and reliability impacts of these resources as they are interconnected to the grid and will ensure that the pricing of electricity remains as low as feasible. Additional regulatory considerations and analysis may be required as the distributed energy resources ("DER") market, technologies, and programs evolve. TVA is working to develop pricing and regulatory structures with a deliberate and thoughtful analysis of each current and future program offering. This requires strong partnerships with LPCs to give customers choices and provide end-use consumers the flexibility they desire. 
During its February 2019 meeting, the TVA Board approved new renewable power solutions, including a mid-scale option. The mid-scale option, also known as the Flexibility Research Project, is a joint project with LPCs to enable solutions for situations where the end-use consumer needs onsite renewable or distributed generation and for TVA to gain market knowledge and operational insights from these research projects. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Renewable Power Solutions.
Through the Home Uplift Program, TVA is partnering with LPCs, state and local governments, non-profit agencies, energy efficiency advocates, and the Tennessee Valley Public Power Association to complete home evaluations and make high-impact home energy upgrades for qualifying homeowners. In addition, TVA and LPCs conduct workshops to educate homeowners about low and no-cost energy efficiency upgrades that improve their quality of life.
TVA has encouraged the development of solar, wind, biomass, and low-impact hydroelectric generation systems across the Tennessee Valley through various current and former offerings. As of September 30, 2019, the combined participation for all such renewable solutions is 415 MW of installed operating capacity with nearly 685 MW of additional approved capacity. Additionally, TVA contracts for approximately 1,215 MW of operating wind capacity from outside the Tennessee Valley via power purchase agreements.
In May 2017, the TVA Board authorized up to $300 million to be spent over the next 10 years, subject to annual budget availability and necessary environmental reviews, to build an enhanced fiber optic network by adding up to 3,500 additional miles that will better connect its operational assets. Fiber is a vital part of TVA's modern communication infrastructure. The new fiber optic lines will improve the reliability and resiliency of the generation and transmission system while enabling the system to better accommodate DER as they enter the market. 
New energy management systems and energy storage technologies present opportunities for more sophisticated and integrated operation of the entire grid. The advent of electric vehicles and small-scale renewable generation has hastened the development of energy storage technologies that have the potential to mitigate the intermittent supply issues associated with many renewable generation options. Implementation of these technologies in conjunction with two-way communication to the site creates the potential for more efficient usage of other DER on the grid.
TVA's Electric Vehicle ("EV") strategy is a staged approach that will evolve as the local EV market matures. Since 2011, TVA has focused on utilizing more EVs and installing charging stations inside the Tennessee Valley. This approach has 
14

enabled TVA to gain insights on the value and impact to utilities of large-scale electrification. TVA has also partnered with over 30 organizations across the State of Tennessee (known as the "Drive Electric Tennessee" collaborative) to create a roadmap to outline local market needs for widespread adoption. This foundational information is crucial as more affordable, longer range EVs come to the market in the next few years.
Onsite energy management technologies and the proliferation of companies interested in providing services to support and aggregate the impacts of such systems provide another DER opportunity. Such systems can afford the consumer benefits through reduced consumption, increased comfort, detailed energy use data, and savings from time-sensitive rate structures. TVA and LPCs must consider the integration of the impacts from changes in energy usage patterns resulting from the operation of such systems.
Demand response systems that take advantage of the increasing sophistication in communication to homes, businesses, and distribution system assets also afford the opportunity for more granular control of system demand. Technologies can manage individual customer systems to shift usage from peak to off-peak periods and create significant reductions in the need for peak generation output. More sophisticated distribution control systems can also lower peak demand through control of excess voltage on the grid on either a dispatchable or continuous basis.
TVA is leading an initiative to determine the value of DER for its system. Initial efforts are focused on small-scale distributed (rooftop) solar, but the efforts are general enough to allow for other distributed options. These efforts are ongoing, led by a team that includes technical support from the Electric Power Research Institute ("EPRI"), to develop a methodology to identify site preferences on the distribution systems of the LPCs. This work, along with locational analysis already completed by TVA, will help in placing utility-scale solar in furtherance of the IRP recommendations as well as distributed solar to meet the needs of LPCs. See Research and Development below. 
Purchased Power and Other Agreements
TVA acquires power from a variety of power producers through long-term and short-term power purchase agreements ("PPAs") as well as through spot market purchases.  During 2019, TVA acquired approximately 87 percent of the power that it purchased through the long-term PPA described below, including agreements for long-term renewable generation resources, approximately one percent through short-term PPAs, and approximately 12 percent on the spot market. 
Renewable Power Purchase Agreements. In order to meet customer preferences and requirements for cleaner and greener energy, TVA has entered into certain PPAs with renewable resource providers during 2019. These agreements are part of progressive partnerships that align the core values of TVA and the public power model with the desire of TVA's customers for renewable energy. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Changing Customer Preferences — Renewable Power Purchase Agreements.

Notes
(1) Power delivery is expected to commence in 2021.
(2) TVA's contract with Southeastern Power Administration ("SEPA") is for 405 MW of capacity; however, at September 30, 2019, TVA's capacity under the contract was 347 MW because of repairs being completed by the USACE.  TVA expects this period of reduced capacity to be in effect until January 2020.  

 Under federal law, TVA is required to purchase energy from qualifying facilities (cogenerators and small power producers) at TVA's avoided cost of either generating this energy itself or purchasing this energy from another source. TVA fulfills this requirement through the Dispersed Power Production Program. As of September 30, 2019, there were 55 generation sources, with a combined qualifying capacity of 263 MW, whose power TVA purchases under this program.
Fuel Supply
General
TVA's consumption of various types of fuel depends largely on the demand for electricity by TVA's customers, the availability of various generating units, and the availability and cost of fuel. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Financial Results — Operating Expenses.
16

Nuclear Fuel
Current Fuel Supply. Converting uranium to nuclear fuel generally involves four stages: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas; the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and the fabrication of the enriched uranium hexafluoride into fuel assemblies.  For its forward four-year (2020-2023) requirements, TVA currently has 100 percent of its uranium mining and milling, conversion services, enrichment services, and fabrication services requirements either in inventory or under contract with various suppliers.  TVA anticipates being able to fill its needs beyond this period by normal contracting processes as market forecasts indicate that the fuel cycle components will be readily available. The net book value of TVA's nuclear fuel was $1.5 billion at both September 30, 2019 and 2018. See Note 15 — Risk Management Activities and Derivative Transactions — Counterparty Risk.
TVA, the DOE, and certain nuclear fuel contractors have entered into agreements providing for surplus DOE highly enriched uranium (uranium that is too highly enriched for use in a nuclear power plant) to be blended with other uranium.  The enriched uranium that results from this blending process, which is called blended low-enriched uranium ("BLEU"), is fabricated into fuel that can be used in a nuclear power plant.  This blended nuclear fuel was first loaded in a Browns Ferry reactor in 2005, and the last fuel under this program is currently being utilized. Under the terms of the interagency agreement between the DOE and TVA, the DOE participated in the savings generated by TVA's use of the BLEU. See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Blended Low-Enriched Uranium Program for a more detailed discussion of the BLEU project.
TVA, the DOE, and certain nuclear fuel contractors have entered into agreements, referred to as the Down-blend offering for Tritium ("DBOT"), that provide for the production, processing, and storage of low-enriched uranium that is to be made using surplus DOE highly enriched uranium and other uranium.  Low-enriched uranium can be fabricated into fuel for use in a nuclear power plant.  Production of the low-enriched uranium began in the summer of 2019 and is contracted to continue through October 2027.  Beginning October 2027, contract activity will consist of storage and flag management.  Flag management ensures that the uranium is of U.S. origin, free from foreign obligations, and unencumbered by policy restrictions, so that it can be used in connection with the production of tritium. Under the terms of the interagency agreement between the DOE and TVA, the DOE will reimburse TVA for a portion of the costs of converting the highly enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium. See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Down-blend Offering for Tritium for a more detailed discussion of the DBOT project.
Low-Level Radioactive Waste.  Certain materials and supplies used in the normal operation of nuclear electrical generating units are potentially exposed to low levels of radiation. TVA sends shipments of low-level radioactive waste to burial facilities in Clive, Utah and Andrews, Texas.  TVA is capable of storing some low-level radioactive waste at its own facilities for an extended period of time, if necessary.
Spent Nuclear Fuel.  All three nuclear sites have dry cask storage facilities.  Sequoyah will need additional capacity by 2028.  Watts Bar will need additional capacity by 2041.  Browns Ferry will need additional storage capacity by the end of 2020.  A project is underway at Browns Ferry to build another independent spent fuel storage installation pad and is scheduled for completion by January 2020. To recover the cost of providing long-term, onsite storage for spent nuclear fuel, TVA filed a breach of contract suit against the U.S. in the Court of Federal Claims in 2001. As a result of this lawsuit and related agreements, TVA has collected approximately $304 million through 2019. 
Tritium-Related Services.  TVA and the DOE are engaged in a long-term interagency agreement under which TVA will, at the DOE's request, irradiate tritium-producing burnable absorber rods ("TPBARs") to assist the DOE in producing tritium for the Department of Defense ("DOD").  This agreement, which ends in 2035, requires the DOE to reimburse TVA for the costs that TVA incurs in connection with providing irradiation services and to pay TVA an irradiation services fee at a specified rate per TPBAR over the period when irradiation occurs.
 In general, TPBARs are irradiated for one operating cycle, which lasts about 18 months.  At the end of the cycle, TVA removes the irradiated rods and loads them into a shipping cask.  The DOE then ships them to its tritium-extraction facility.  TVA loads a fresh set of TPBARs into the reactor during each refueling outage.  Irradiating the TPBARs does not affect TVA's ability to safely operate the reactors to produce electricity.
TVA has provided irradiation services using only Watts Bar Unit 1 since 2003. Although the interagency agreement provides for irradiation services to be performed at Watts Bar and Sequoyah, TVA expects the Watts Bar site to provide sufficient capacity to fulfill this agreement in the near term. The DOE notified TVA of future increased needs for tritium requiring the use of a second reactor. TVA submitted a license amendment to the NRC in December 2017 to authorize the irradiation of TPBARs in Watts Bar Unit 2. The NRC approved the license amendment request in May 2019.

Natural Gas and Fuel Oil
During 2019, TVA purchased a significant amount of its natural gas requirements from a variety of suppliers under contracts with terms of up to three years and purchased substantially all of its fuel oil requirements on the spot market. The net book value of TVA's natural gas inventory was $15 million and $18 million at September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The net book value of TVA's fuel oil inventory was $82 million and $84 million at September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At September 30, 2019, 80 of the combustion turbines that TVA operates were dual-fuel capable, and TVA has fuel oil stored on each of these sites as a backup to natural gas.
TVA purchases natural gas from multiple suppliers on a daily, monthly, seasonal, and term basis.  During 2019, daily, monthly, seasonal, and term contracts accounted for 21 percent, five percent, 30 percent, and 44 percent of purchases, respectively.  TVA plans to continue using contracts of various lengths and terms to meet the projected natural gas needs of its natural gas fleet.  During 2019, TVA transported natural gas on eight separate pipelines, with approximately 31 percent being transported on a single pipeline. During 2019, TVA maintained a total of approximately 1,405,000 million British thermal unit(s) ("mmBtu") per day of firm transportation capacity on six major pipelines, with approximately 33 percent of total firm transportation capacity being maintained on a single pipeline.
TVA utilizes natural gas storage services at seven facilities with a total capacity of 8.35 billion per cubic feet ("Bcf") of firm service and 2.30 Bcf of interruptible service to manage the daily balancing requirements of the eight pipelines used by TVA, with approximately 42 percent of the total storage capacity being maintained at a single facility. During 2019, storage levels were generally maintained at between 40 and 80 percent of the maximum contracted capacity at each facility. As TVA's natural gas requirements grow, it is anticipated that additional storage capacity may need to be acquired to meet the needs of the generating assets.  In 2020, TVA does not expect to add a significant amount of firm capacity to its storage portfolio.
Coal
Coal consumption at TVA's coal-fired generating facilities during 2019 and 2018 was approximately 15 million tons and 17 million tons, respectively.  At September 30, 2019 and 2018, TVA had 33 days and 30 days of system-wide coal supply at full burn rate, respectively, with net book values of $197 million and $164 million, respectively. 
TVA utilizes both short-term and long-term coal contracts.  During 2019, long-term contracts made up 82 percent of coal purchases, and short-term contracts accounted for the remaining 18 percent.  TVA plans to continue using contracts of various lengths, terms, and coal quality to meet its expected consumption and inventory requirements.  During 2019 and 2018, TVA purchased coal by basin as follows:
18

The following charts present the proportion of each delivery method TVA utilizes for its coal supply for the periods indicated:
Generally, total system coal inventories were at or below target levels for 2019. TVA began 2019 with low coal inventories due to higher than expected utilization during the summer of 2018. Inventory balances were restored throughout the year to meet winter and summer peak demands.
Transmission
The TVA transmission system is one of the largest in North America.  TVA's transmission system has 69 interconnections with 13 neighboring electric systems, and delivered nearly 158 billion kWh of electricity to TVA customers in 2019.  In carrying out its responsibility for transmission grid reliability in the TVA service area, TVA has operated with 99.999 percent reliability since 2000 in delivering electricity to customers. See Item 2, Properties — Transmission Properties.
Pursuant to its Transmission Service Guidelines, TVA offers transmission services to eligible customers to transmit wholesale power in a manner that is comparable to TVA's own use of the transmission system. TVA has also adopted and operates in accordance with its published Transmission Standards of Conduct and separates its transmission function from its power marketing function.
TVA is subject to federal reliability standards that are set forth by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation ("NERC") and approved by FERC. These standards are designed to maintain the reliability of the bulk electric system, including TVA's generation and transmission system, and include areas such as maintenance, training, operations, planning, modeling, critical infrastructure, physical and cyber security, vegetation management, and facility ratings. TVA recognizes that reliability standards and expectations for transmission systems continue to become more complex and stringent. 
Additional transmission upgrades may be required to maintain reliability.  Upgrades may include enhancements to existing lines and substations or new installations as necessary to provide adequate power transmission capacity, maintain voltage support, and ensure generating plant and transmission system stability. 
In May 2017, the TVA Board approved a $300 million, multi-year, strategic fiber optic initiative that will expand TVA's fiber capacity and improve the reliability and resiliency of the transmission system.  The network expansion is designed to help meet the power system's growing need for bandwidth as well as accommodate the integration of new DER. As of September 30, 2019, TVA had installed 483 miles of fiber optic lines and spent $79 million on installation of the fiber optic lines. TVA expects to spend an additional $221 million to complete the project.

The TVA Board approved $245 million for the construction of a new system operations center. The new secured facility is being built to accommodate a new energy management system and to adapt to new regulatory requirements.  The facility is expected to be constructed by 2021 and fully operational by 2023. As of September 30, 2019, TVA had spent approximately $14 million on the project and expects to spend an additional $231 million.
Weather and Seasonality
Weather affects both the demand for and the market prices of electricity. TVA's power system is generally a dual-peaking system in which the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs. TVA uses degree days to measure the impact of weather on its power operations. Degree days measure the extent to which the TVA system 23-station average temperatures vary from 65 degrees Fahrenheit. During 2019, TVA transitioned degree 
19

day calculation methodologies, moving from the average temperatures of the five largest cities in TVA's service area to the average temperatures of 23 stations throughout TVA's service area. This transition provides TVA with increased geographic granularity throughout its service territory and improves modeling accuracy. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Sales of Electricity.
Competition
TVA provides electricity in a service area that is largely free of competition from other electric power providers based on the provisions of the TVA Act. This service area is defined primarily by provisions of law and long-term contracts. The fence limits the region in which TVA or LPCs that distribute TVA power may provide power. The anti-cherrypicking provision limits the ability of others to use the TVA transmission system for the purpose of serving customers within TVA's service area.  State service territory laws limit unregulated third parties' ability to sell electricity to consumers. All TVA wholesale power contracts are all requirements contracts. However, other utilities may use their own transmission lines to serve customers within TVA's service area, and third parties are able to avoid the restrictions on serving end-use customers by selling or leasing generating assets to a customer rather than selling electricity. These threats underscore the need for TVA to strategically price its products and services and design rates to be competitive.  There have also been some efforts in the past to erode the anti-cherrypicking provision, and the protection of the anti-cherrypicking provision could be limited and perhaps eliminated by federal legislation at some time in the future.  
TVA also faces competition in the form of emerging technologies.  Improvements in energy efficiency technologies, smart technologies, and energy storage technologies may reduce the demand for centrally provided power. The growing interest by customers in generating their own power through DER has the potential to lead to a reduction in the load served by TVA as well as cause TVA to re-evaluate how it operates the overall grid system to continue to provide highly reliable power at affordable rates.  See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Distributed Energy Resources.
Finally, TVA and other utility companies are facing an evolving marketplace of increased competition driven by customer choice and behavior. As technology develops, consumers' demands for access to diverse products and services may increase, creating opportunities for growth with new products and services resulting from emerging technologies.
Research and Development
Investments in TVA's research portfolio are supported through partnership and collaboration with LPCs, EPRI, DOE, federal agencies, national labs, peer utilities, universities, industry vendors, participation in professional societies, and other research consortiums.
Annual investments made in science and technological innovation help meet future business and operational
challenges. Each year, TVA's annual research portfolio is updated based on a broad range of operational and industry drivers to assess key technology gaps, performance issues, or other significant issues, addressed through research and development. Core research activities directly support optimization of TVA's generation and transmission assets, air and water quality, energy utilization, and distributed/clean energy integration. TVA has launched a research program focused on evaluating the potential to deploy grid-scale battery energy storage technology to optimize the existing TVA generation assets and improve the resiliency of the transmission system. This research will guide future application of battery storage as part of the evolving bulk power system in the region.
TVA evaluates emerging energy efficiency and load management technologies for market and program readiness. Efforts are directed towards demonstrating and validating the performance, reliability, and consumer acceptance of new efficiency technologies, as well as the value of energy efficiency and load management technologies for the consumer, LPCs, and TVA.
TVA is assessing potential electrification programs that improve resource use and reduce environmental impacts (especially in the transportation sector). Assessments include a multi-stakeholder vision and roadmap effort aimed at identifying the path forward for electric vehicles in Tennessee. The approach provides for broad engagement from industry, government, and utilities that could be applied in other states in the TVA service territory. In addition, TVA is continuing its evaluation of potential electric vehicle adoption strategies through coordination of activities with EPRI and industry stakeholders related to operational fleet requirements. Additional areas of focus include LPC engagement on plug-in electric vehicle grid integration and readiness for various transportation electrification technologies. In addition, research in electrification applications on charging stations, impacts from charging stations to the power grid, refinement of power-system control processes, and development of smart charging strategies to maximize the potential of electricity to replace petroleum as the transportation fuel of choice.
TVA and LPCs engage in several initiatives related to grid modernization. Research includes technologies and applications advancement in intelligent transmission and distribution systems. Smart meter technology has the potential to shift usage patterns away from peak demand times which could change costs significantly. Additionally, intelligent transmission systems would give TVA the ability to nearly instantaneously diagnose problems, make corrections, and engage transmission and generation resources quickly so that power would keep flowing. This could promote reduced emissions, lower energy costs, 
20

and add greater flexibility to accommodate the new consumer-generated sources under TVA's renewable energy programs. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources — Distributed Energy Resources.
Finally, TVA is evaluating small clean power resources that can be aggregated to meet regular demand. Research efforts into clean DER seek to understand the scope and impact on operations and business economics and to develop strategies for adapting to the evolving electricity landscape in the Tennessee Valley. Battery storage and solar power models deployed in the Tennessee Valley are also being evaluated to better understand their impacts to the grid. Initial economic analyses have been conducted to identify the value of DER (particularly photovoltaic solar generation) to both TVA and the LPC system. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Distributed Energy Resources.
Flood Control Activities
The Tennessee River watershed has one of the highest annual rainfall totals of any watershed in the U.S., averaging 51 inches per year. During 2019, approximately 67 inches of rain fell in the Tennessee Valley. TVA manages the Tennessee River system in an integrated manner, balancing hydroelectric generation with navigation, flood damage reduction, water quality and supply, and recreation. TVA spills or releases excess water through its dams in order to reduce flood damage to the Tennessee Valley. TVA typically spills only when all available hydroelectric generating turbines are operating at full capacity and additional water still needs to be moved downstream.
Significant flooding occurred in portions of the Tennessee Valley in February 2019. During this time, the Tennessee Valley received 11.6 inches of rainfall, which was 269 percent of normal. Although many locations along the Tennessee River reached or exceeded flood stage, TVA's efforts, including storing water in large tributary reservoirs, accounted for approximately $1.6 billion in avoided damages in areas such as Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Environmental Stewardship Activities
TVA's mission includes managing the Tennessee River, its tributaries, and federal lands along the shoreline to provide, among other things, year-round navigation, flood damage reduction, affordable and reliable electricity, recreational opportunities, adequate water supply, improved water quality, and natural resource protection.  There are 49 dams that comprise TVA's integrated reservoir system. Each dam may also have ancillary structures used to support or assist the main dam's function. The reservoir system provides approximately 800 miles of commercially navigable waterways and also provides significant flood reduction benefits both within the Tennessee River system and downstream on the lower Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The reservoir system also provides a water supply for residential and industrial customers, as well as cooling water for TVA's coal-fired plants, combined cycle plants, and nuclear power plants. TVA's Environmental Policy provides objectives for an integrated approach related to providing cleaner, reliable, and low-cost energy, supporting sustainable economic growth, and engaging in proactive environmental stewardship in a balanced and ecologically sound manner. The Environmental Policy provides additional direction in several environmental stewardship areas, including water resource protection and improvements, sustainable land use, and natural resource management.
TVA serves the people of the TVA region through the integrated management of the Tennessee River system and public lands, which include approximately 11,000 miles of shoreline; 650,000 surface acres of reservoir water; and 293,000 acres of reservoir lands.  TVA accomplishes this mission and supports the objectives of the TVA Environmental Policy through implementation of its natural resources stewardship strategy.  Within this strategy, TVA confirms a desire to remain agile, balance competing demands, and be a catalyst for collaboration in order to protect and enhance biological, cultural, and water resources as well as create and sustain destinations for recreation and opportunities for learning and research.  As part of the strategy, TVA intends to assist water-based community development with issuing permits, technical support, and land agreements using planning, clear regulations, meaningful guidelines, and consistent enforcement. Additional guidance for carrying out many of TVA's essential stewardship responsibilities is provided in TVA's Natural Resource Plan ("NRP"). TVA is currently updating its NRP. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Natural Resource Plan.
Economic Development Activities
Economic development, along with energy production and environmental stewardship, is one of the primary statutory purposes of TVA. TVA works with its LPCs; regional, state, and local agencies; and communities to showcase the advantages available to businesses locating or expanding in TVA's service area. TVA's primary economic development goals are to recruit companies to locate in the Tennessee Valley, encourage expansion of existing business and industry that provide quality jobs, and assist communities in the Tennessee Valley with economic growth opportunities. TVA seeks to meet these goals through a combination of initiatives and partnerships designed to provide financial assistance, technical services, industry expertise, and site-selection assistance to new and existing businesses.
Economic development programs developed by TVA include those which focus on supporting all communities, including rural and economically distressed communities, across the Tennessee Valley by working in close partnership with other federal and state organizations. TVA also jointly offers incentive programs with participating LPCs. These programs offer competitive incentives to existing and potential power customers in certain business sectors that make multi-year commitments to invest in 
21

the Tennessee Valley. In addition to financial support for these programs, TVA offers resources to communities and economic developers in the areas of recruitment, leadership development, industrial product preparedness (sites and buildings), planning, and project assistance.
TVA's economic development efforts helped recruit or expand 215 companies into the TVA service area during 2019. These companies announced capital investments of over $8.9 billion and the expected creation and/or retention of approximately 66,500 jobs.
Regulation
Congress
TVA exists pursuant to the TVA Act as enacted by Congress and carries on its operations in accordance with this legislation.  Congress can enact legislation expanding or reducing TVA's activities, change TVA's structure, and even eliminate TVA.  Congress can also enact legislation requiring the sale of some or all of the assets TVA operates or reduce the U.S.'s ownership in TVA.  To allow TVA to operate more flexibly than a traditional government agency, Congress exempted TVA from all or parts of certain general federal laws that govern other agencies, such as federal labor relations laws and the laws related to the hiring of federal employees, the procurement of supplies and services, and the acquisition of land.  Other federal laws enacted since the creation of TVA that are applicable to other agencies have been made applicable to TVA, including those related to paying employees overtime and protecting the environment, cultural resources, and civil rights.
Securities and Exchange Commission
Section 37 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") requires TVA to file with the SEC such periodic, current, and supplementary information, documents, and reports as would be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act if TVA were an issuer of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act.  Section 37 of the Exchange Act exempts TVA from complying with Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act, which requires each member of a listed issuer's audit committee to be an independent member of the board of directors of the issuer.  Since TVA is an agency and instrumentality of the U.S., securities issued or guaranteed by TVA are "exempted securities" under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and may be offered and sold without registration under the Securities Act.  In addition, securities issued or guaranteed by TVA are "exempted securities" and "government securities" under the Exchange Act.  TVA is also exempt from Sections 14(a)-(d) and 14(f)-(h) of the Exchange Act (which address proxy solicitations) insofar as those sections relate to securities issued by TVA, and transactions in TVA securities are exempt from rules governing tender offers under Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act.  Also, since TVA securities are exempted securities under the Securities Act, TVA is exempt from the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 insofar as it relates to securities issued by TVA, and no independent trustee is required for these securities.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
Under the FPA, TVA is not a "public utility," a term which primarily refers to investor-owned utilities.  Therefore, TVA is not subject to the full jurisdiction that FERC exercises over public utilities under the FPA.  TVA is, however, an "electric utility" and a "transmitting utility" as defined in the FPA and, thus, is directly subject to certain aspects of FERC's jurisdiction. Under the FPA, for example, TVA (1) must comply with certain standards designed to maintain transmission system reliability, (2) can be ordered to interconnect its transmission facilities with the electrical facilities of independent generators and of other electric utilities that meet certain requirements, (3) can be ordered to transmit wholesale power provided that the order (a) does not impair the reliability of the TVA or surrounding systems and (b) meets the applicable requirements concerning terms, conditions, and rates for service, as well as the anti-cherrypicking provision, (4) is subject to FERC review of the transmission rates and the terms and conditions of service that TVA provides, and (5) is prohibited from (a) reporting false information on the price of electricity sold at wholesale or the availability of transmission capacity to a federal agency with intent to fraudulently affect the data being compiled by the agency and (b) using manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances in connection with the purchase or sale of power or transmission services subject to FERC's jurisdiction.

In addition, the FPA provides FERC with authority (1) to order refunds of excessive prices on short-term sales (transactions lasting 31 days or less) by all market participants, including TVA, in price gouging situations if such sales are through an independent system operator or regional transmission organization under a FERC-approved tariff, (2) to issue regulations requiring the reporting, on a timely basis, of information about the availability and prices of wholesale power and transmission service by all market participants, including TVA, (3) to investigate electric industry practices, including TVA's operations that are subject to FERC's jurisdiction, and (4) to impose civil penalties of up to $1 million per day for each violation of the provisions of the FPA discussed in the prior paragraph that are applicable to TVA. Criminal penalties may also result from such violations. 
Finally, while not required to do so, TVA has elected to implement various FERC orders and regulations pertaining to public utilities on a voluntary basis to the extent that they are consistent with TVA's obligations under the TVA Act. 

22

Nuclear Regulatory Commission
TVA operates its nuclear facilities in a highly regulated environment and is subject to the oversight of the NRC, an independent federal agency that sets the rules that users of radioactive materials must follow.  The NRC has broad authority to impose requirements relating to the licensing, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear generating facilities.  In addition, if TVA fails to comply with requirements promulgated by the NRC, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down units, or modify, suspend, or revoke TVA's operating licenses.
Environmental Protection Agency
TVA is subject to regulation by the EPA in a variety of areas, including air quality control, water quality control, and management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.  See Environmental Matters below.
States
The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states, without federal legislative consent, from regulating the manner in which the federal government conducts its activities.  As a federal agency, TVA is exempt from regulation, control, and taxation by states except in certain areas where Congress has clearly made TVA subject to state regulation. See Environmental Matters below.
Other Federal Entities
TVA's activities and records are also subject to review to varying degrees by other federal entities, including the Government Accountability Office and the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB").  There is also an Office of the Inspector General which reviews TVA's activities and records.
Taxation and Tax Equivalents
TVA is not subject to federal income taxation.  In addition, neither TVA nor its property, franchises, or income is subject to taxation by states or their subdivisions.  The TVA Act, however, does require TVA to make tax equivalent payments to states and counties in which TVA conducts power operations or in which TVA has acquired properties previously subject to state and local taxation.  The total amount of these payments is five percent of gross revenues from the sale of power during the preceding year excluding sales or deliveries to other federal agencies and off-system sales with other utilities, with a provision for minimum payments under certain circumstances.  Except for certain direct payments TVA is required to make to counties, distribution of tax equivalent payments within a state is determined by individual state legislation.
Environmental Matters
TVA's activities, particularly its power generation activities, are subject to comprehensive regulation under environmental laws and regulations relating to air pollution, water pollution, and management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, among other issues. Emissions from all TVA-owned and operated units (including small combustion turbine units of less than 25 MW) have been reduced from historic peaks. Emissions of nitrogen oxide ("NOx") have been reduced by 96 percent below peak 1995 levels and emissions of sulfur dioxide ("SO2") have been reduced by 99 percent below 1977 levels through CY 2018. For CY 2018, TVA's emission of carbon dioxide ("CO2") from its sources was 52 million tons, a 51 percent reduction from 2005 levels. This amount includes 5,037 tons from units rated at less than 25 MW. To remain consistent and to align with the EPA's reporting requirements, TVA intends to continue reporting CO2 emissions on a calendar year basis.
Clean Air Act
The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation's air quality and control sources of air pollution. The major CAA programs that affect TVA's power generation activities are described below.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The CAA requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") for certain air pollutants. The EPA has done this for ozone, particulate matter ("PM"), SO2, nitrogen dioxide ("NO2"), carbon monoxide, and lead. Over the years, the EPA has made the NAAQS more stringent. Each state must develop a plan to be approved by the EPA for achieving and maintaining NAAQS within its borders. These plans impose limits on emissions from pollution sources, including TVA fossil fuel-fired plants. Areas meeting a NAAQS are designated as attainment areas. Areas not meeting a NAAQS are designated as non-attainment areas, and more stringent requirements apply in those areas, including stricter controls on industrial facilities and more complicated permitting processes. TVA fossil fuel-fired plants can be impacted by these requirements. All TVA generating units are located in areas designated as in attainment with NAAQS.
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The EPA issued the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR") in July 2011 requiring several states in the eastern U.S. to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that contribute to pollution in other states.  In 2016, the EPA issued an update to CSAPR to address cross-state air pollution (the "CSAPR Update Rule"). The EPA subsequently issued an additional rule to resolve any remaining cross-state air pollutant issues ("CSAPR Close-Out Rule"). The 
23

U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("D.C. Circuit") has remanded a portion of the CSAPR Update Rule back to the EPA to address its failure to require upwind states to eliminate substantial contributions to downwind nonattainment by the statutory deadline. The D.C. Circuit also vacated the CSAPR Close-Out Rule. TVA has not had and does not currently anticipate significant changes to its operations based on the CSAPR Update Rule and CSAPR Close-Out Rule in its current form.
Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for Electric Utility Units. Following litigation over the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ("MATS") and the question of whether the EPA was required to consider cost before deciding whether the regulation of hazardous air pollutants ("HAP") emitted from steam electric utilities was appropriate and necessary, the EPA released a proposed finding that it is not appropriate and necessary to regulate HAP emissions from steam electric utilities. However, the EPA also proposed that notwithstanding this new finding, it would not remove electric generating units from the source categories listed under Section 112 of the CAA and it would not rescind the MATS requirements. Additionally, the EPA proposed to find that further restrictions on HAP emissions are not warranted upon conducting a residual risk and technology review for this source category. Until a final rule is issued, specific impacts to TVA cannot be determined; however, as proposed, the rule is not expected to change TVA's MATS compliance requirements or strategy.
Environmental Agreements. See Note 22 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings — Environmental Agreements for a discussion of the Environmental Agreements, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. 
Acid Rain Program. The Acid Rain Program is intended to help reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx, which are the primary pollutants implicated in the formation of acid rain. The program includes a cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO2 emissions from power plants. TVA continues to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions from its coal-fired plants, and the SO2 allowances allocated to TVA under the Acid Rain Program are sufficient to cover the operation of its coal-fired plants. In the TVA service area, the limitations imposed on SO2 and NOx emissions by the CSAPR program are more stringent than the Acid Rain Program. Therefore, TVA forecasts that the Acid Rain Program will not impose any additional material requirements on TVA.
Regional Haze Program. The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule, which required certain older sources to install best available retrofit technology. No additional controls or lower operating limits are required for any TVA units to meet best available retrofit technology requirements. In January 2017, the EPA published the final rule that changed some of the requirements for Regional Haze State Implementation Plans ("SIPs"). TVA does not expect significant impacts to its operations from these changes, but specific impacts cannot be determined until future Regional Haze SIPs are developed.
Opacity. Opacity, or visible emissions, measures the denseness (or color) of power plant plumes and has traditionally been used by states as a means of monitoring good maintenance and operation of particulate control equipment. Under some conditions, retrofitting a unit with additional equipment to better control SO2 and NOx emissions can adversely affect opacity performance, and TVA and other utilities have addressed this issue. The evaluation of utilities' compliance with opacity requirements is coming under increased scrutiny, especially during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. Historically, SIPs developed under the CAA typically excluded periods of startup, shutdowns, and malfunctions, but in June 2015, the EPA finalized a rule to eliminate such exclusions. The EPA rule required states to modify their implementation plans by November 2016. Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi submitted implementation plans, but Alabama has not. Environmental petitioners and several states filed petitions for judicial review of the EPA final rule before the D.C. Circuit. In April 2017, the D.C. Circuit, at the request of the new EPA Administrator, ordered this litigation to be suspended pending the EPA's review to determine whether to reconsider all or part of the rule. TVA does not expect significant impacts from these rule changes. 
Petition to Expand the Ozone Transport Region. In December 2013, eight of the twelve states that make up the Ozone Transport Region ("OTR") submitted a petition requesting the EPA to add nine states, including Kentucky and Tennessee, to the OTR. If states within TVA's service territory were included in the OTR, TVA would be required to further reduce NOx emissions. Six of the states filed suit when the EPA failed to act on the petition. In January 2017, the EPA subsequently published a notice in the Federal Register proposing to deny the petition on the basis that the CAA provides other options. The EPA then denied the petition in October 2017. In December 2017, the eight petitioning states filed in the D.C. Circuit a petition for judicial review of the EPA's denial of the petition to add states to the OTR. On April 23, 2019, the D.C. Circuit denied the petition for judicial review of the EPA's refusal to expand the OTR to include nine additional states.
Kentucky Startup/Shutdown Regulations. In April 2018, the Kentucky Division for Air Quality published final revised startup/shutdown regulations for new and existing indirect heat exchangers. Shawnee Fossil Plant ("Shawnee") and Paradise have boilers which will be subject to these rules when incorporated into their air permits. The revised rules do not significantly impact operations at Shawnee or Paradise.
Kentucky State Implementation Plan to Address Downwind Ozone Impacts. Emissions from utility units in Kentucky that contribute to ozone are already limited by the CSAPR Update Rule and are declining. In February 2018, Kentucky submitted a proposed revision to its SIP to address downwind state ozone impacts. The proposed SIP did not require emission reductions beyond current requirements, and in July 2018, the EPA issued a final rule approving Kentucky's revised SIP. No additional emission reductions are required by the SIP for TVA's Kentucky generating units.

New York Petition to Address Impacts from Upwind High Emitting Sources. In March 2018, the State of New York filed a petition with the EPA under Section 126(b) of the CAA to address ozone impacts on New York from the NOx emissions from sources emitting at least 400 tons of NOx in CY 2017 from nine states including Kentucky. The New York petition requests that the EPA require daily NOx limits for utility units with SCRs such as Paradise Unit 3 and emission reductions from utility units without SCRs such as Shawnee Units 2, 3 and 5-9. Kentucky utility unit NOx emissions are already limited by the CSAPR Update Rule and are declining, and current EPA modeling projects no additional requirements to reduce Kentucky NOx emissions are necessary. During its February 2019 meeting, the TVA Board approved the retirement of Paradise Unit 3 by December 2020. On September 20, 2019, the EPA finalized its denial of New York's petition because the state did not demonstrate, and the EPA could not independently establish, that sources in the states listed in the petition contribute to exceedances of the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS in New York. On October 29, 2019, the state of New York filed a petition in the D.C. Circuit for judicial review of the EPA's denial of the petition. Specific impacts to TVA as a result of the filing of the petition for judicial review cannot be determined at this time.

Affordable Clean Energy Rule. On June 19, 2019, the EPA finalized the final Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule and repealed the EPA's previous regulation addressing greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired units. The ACE rule establishes guidelines for GHG emissions from existing coal-fired units based on efficiency improvements that can be achieved at those units at reasonable cost. States are required to apply the emission guidelines to coal-fired units within their respective jurisdictions and take into account the remaining useful lives of those units. The impact of the ACE rule on TVA's coal-fired units cannot be determined until Tennessee and Kentucky submit to the EPA their SIPs implementing guidelines in the ACE rule and the EPA approves these SIPs. The ACE rule allows states three years to submit their SIPs and allows the EPA 18 months for approval.

New Source Performance Standards. On December 6, 2018, the EPA proposed revisions to the GHG emission standards for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units that were finalized by the EPA in October 2015. For coal-fired units, the EPA proposes to revise the current new source standards such that carbon capture and sequestration technology is no longer necessary to meet the standards of performance that reflect the best system of emission reduction. The resulting limits are less stringent than limits under the current rule and can be met by modern coal-fired units (e.g., supercritical steam generators) in combination with best operating practices, but without carbon capture and sequestration. The EPA is not proposing to revise the new source performance standard for GHG emission from gas-fired units. If finalized as proposed, the revisions are not expected to significantly impact TVA since TVA does not currently plan to construct, modify, or reconstruct any coal-fired units.
Maryland Petition to Address Impacts from Upwind Electric Generating Units. In September 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit against the EPA for failing to act within 60 days on Maryland's petition under Section 126 of the CAA to address ozone impacts on Maryland from the NOx emissions of 36 electric generating units, including TVA's Paradise coal-fired Unit 3. Paradise coal-fired Unit 3 is equipped with a SCR that TVA continuously operates to the greatest extent technically practicable in order to minimize NOx emissions. The EPA has denied the petition because existing regulations already address emissions from the generating units at issue. On October 15, 2018, the State of Maryland filed a petition for judicial review with the D.C. Circuit asking the court to review the EPA's decision.
Climate Change
Executive Actions. In March 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order ("EO") 13783, "Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth."  The EO reversed or altered many actions taken by the federal government in the last four years of the Obama Administration to address climate change and mandates that federal agencies review existing regulations and actions that potentially burden energy development and use.  Several EOs, policy statements, and reports that established climate change objectives were rescinded or revoked.  EO 13783 did not mandate that the EPA reconsider its finding under the CAA that GHG emissions cause climate change and therefore endanger public health and the environment. 
While EO 13783 requires review of all agency actions that potentially burden the safe, efficient development of domestic energy resources, the final specific requirements and impacts from implementation of this EO are not possible to predict at this time. It is likely that there will be some delay in the development of future GHG reduction requirements. 
In May 2018, EO 13834, "Efficient Federal Operations," was signed. EO 13834 emphasizes meeting statutory requirements and gives agencies greater flexibility and discretion to decide how best to improve operations in order to "optimize energy and environmental performance, reduce waste, and cut costs." It also calls on the White House Council of Environmental Quality to streamline pre-existing environmental orders by "refocusing agencies on cost-effectively meeting mandates and goals" established by law. The order seeks to consolidate requirements related to energy and water efficiency, high performance buildings, renewable energy consumption, and federal vehicle fleet management. TVA consistently seeks to improve its operations in order to optimize energy and environmental performance and does not anticipate significant changes in its planning or operations as a result of the new EO.
International Accords. In September 2016, the U.S. formally accepted the Paris Agreement. The agreement met the threshold of at least 55 countries that account for at least 55 percent of global GHG emissions and formally entered into force in November 2016. The durability of the Paris Agreement commitments is uncertain after President Trump's announcement in 
25

June 2017 that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement. On November 4, 2019, the United States formally notified the United Nations that it would withdraw from the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the effective date for the withdrawal will be November 4, 2020. Specific impacts to TVA cannot be determined at this time.
In response to President Trump's Paris withdrawal announcement, 25 states have formed the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of governors committed to reducing GHG emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. North Carolina and Virginia are the only states in the TVA region that are U.S. Climate Alliance members. Among other commitments, each state commits to implement policies that advance the goals of the Paris Agreement, aiming to reduce GHG emissions by at least 26-28 percent below CY 2005 levels by CY 2025 and to accelerate new and existing policies to reduce carbon pollution and promote clean energy deployment at the state and federal level. In June 2017, America's Pledge was announced as a collaborative opportunity for these states to work with U.S. cities and businesses representing more than half of the U.S. economy. In September 2018, America's Pledge released its economy-wide policy analysis with recommendations of how states, cities, businesses, and other stakeholders can influence U.S. decarbonization. It is premature to determine potential impacts to TVA.
Litigation. In addition to legislative activity, climate change issues have been the subject of a number of lawsuits, including lawsuits against TVA. See Note 22 for additional information.
Indirect Consequences of Regulation or Business Trends. Legal, technological, political, and scientific developments regarding climate change may create new opportunities and risks. The potential indirect consequences could include an increase or decrease in electricity demand, increased demand for generation from alternative energy sources, and subsequent impacts to business reputation and public opinion. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources above.
Physical Impacts of Climate Change. TVA manages the potential effects of climate change on its mission, programs, and operations within its environmental management processes. The goal of the adaptation planning process is to ensure TVA continues to achieve its mission and program goals and to operate in a secure, effective, and efficient manner in a changing climate by integrating climate change adaptation efforts in coordination with state and local partners, tribal governments, and private stakeholders. TVA's Climate Change Adaptation Plan was last updated in June 2018.
Actions Taken by TVA to Reduce GHG Emissions. TVA has reduced GHG emissions from both its generation stations and its operations.  As discussed earlier in this Item 1, Business, recent TVA Board actions have focused on TVA's plan to balance its coal-fired generation by increasing its nuclear capacity, modernizing its hydroelectric generation system, increasing natural gas-fired generation, installing emission control equipment on certain of its coal-fired units, increasing its purchases of renewable energy, building solar facilities, and investing in energy efficiency initiatives to reduce energy use in the Tennessee Valley.  Additionally, TVA has invested to reduce energy use in its operations.  The combination of more stringent environmental regulations, lower natural gas prices, and lower demand for energy across the Tennessee Valley has reduced the utilization of coal-fired generation.  These factors have resulted in lower CO2 emissions from the TVA system.
Renewable/Clean Energy Standards
Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have established enforceable or mandatory requirements for electric utilities to generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources.  One state within the TVA service area, North Carolina, has a mandatory renewable standard that, while not applying directly to TVA, does apply to TVA's LPCs serving retail customers in that state.  TVA's policy is to provide compliance assistance to any distributor of TVA power, and TVA is providing assistance to the covered LPCs that sell TVA power in North Carolina.  Likewise, the Mississippi Public Service Commission adopted an energy efficiency rule applying to electric and natural gas providers in the state, and TVA is supplying information on participation in TVA's energy efficiency programs to support the covered Mississippi LPCs.  
Water Quality Control Developments
Cooling Water Intake Structures. In May 2014, the EPA released a final rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act relating to cooling water intake structures ("CWIS") for existing power generating facilities. The rule requires changes in CWIS used to cool the vast majority of coal, gas, and nuclear steam-electric generating plants and a wide range of manufacturing and industrial facilities in the U.S.  The final rule requires CWIS to reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts, primarily by reducing the amount of fish and shellfish that are impinged or entrained at a cooling water intake structure. These new requirements will potentially affect a number of TVA's fossil- and nuclear-fueled facilities and will likely require capital upgrades to ensure compliance. Most TVA facilities are projected to require retrofit of CWIS with "fish-friendly" screens and fish return systems to achieve compliance with the new rule. The rule is being implemented through permits issued under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") in Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. State agencies administer the NPDES permit program in most states including those in which TVA's facilities are located.  In addition, the responsible state agencies must provide all permit applications to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service for a 60-day review prior to public notice and an opportunity to comment during the public notice. As a result, the permit may include requirements for additional studies of threatened and endangered species arising from U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service comments and may require additional measures be taken to protect threatened and endangered species and critical habitats directly or indirectly related to the plant cooling water intake. TVA's review of the final rule indicates that the rule offers adequate 
26

flexibility for cost-effective compliance.  The required compliance timeframe is linked to plant specific NPDES permit renewal cycles (i.e., technology retrofits), and compliance is expected to be required in the CYs 2022-2024 timeframe.
Hydrothermal Discharges. The EPA and many states continue to focus regulatory attention on potential effects of hydrothermal discharges. Many TVA plants have variances from thermal standards under Section 316(a) of the Clean Water Act that are subject to review as NPDES permits are renewed. Specific data requirements in the future will be determined based on negotiations between TVA and regulators. If plant thermal limits are made more stringent, TVA may have to install cooling towers at some of its plants and operate installed cooling towers more often. This could result in a substantial cost to TVA.
Steam-Electric Effluent Guidelines. In 2015, the EPA revised existing steam-electric effluent limitation guidelines ("ELGs"), which regulate water discharge pollutants and require the application of certain pollutant control technologies. The 2015 ELGs establish more stringent performance standards for existing and new sources and will require major upgrades to wastewater treatment options at all coal-fired plants. Compliance with new requirements was originally required in the CYs 2018-2023 timeframe, but the EPA delayed the compliance for flue gas desulfurization ("FGD") wastewater and bottom ash transport water until CYs 2020-2023 to allow the EPA time to review and potentially revise the ELGs with regard to these waste streams.
In August 2017, the EPA Administrator announced his decision to conduct a rulemaking to potentially revise the new, more stringent effluent limitations that apply to bottom ash transport water and FGD wastewater in the CY 2015 ELG rule. In April 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ("Fifth Circuit") remanded portions of the 2015 ELG because it determined that some of the standards did not comply with statutory requirements. The EPA proposed revised ELGs for bottom ash transport water and FGD wastewater on November 4, 2019, but did address the portions of the ELG that were remanded by the Fifth Circuit.
The primary impact for TVA is on the operation of existing coal-fired generation facilities. The proposed revised ELGs could impact long-term investment decisions being made relative to the long-term compliance and operability of these plants. The proposed revisions may require TVA to install additional wastewater treatment systems for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water and TVA could incur substantial costs to comply with the new rule.  The proposed revision also includes a subcategory for which the Cumberland Fossil Plant (“Cumberland”) would qualify that provides TVA greater flexibility in meeting the ELGs. However, given that these are proposed rules, it is unclear what the final impact to TVA will be.  The proposed revisions may require TVA to install additional wastewater treatment systems for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water and TVA could incur substantial costs to comply with the new rule.

Other Clean Water Act Requirements. As is the case in other industrial sectors, TVA and other utilities are also facing more stringent requirements related to the protection of wetlands, reductions in storm water impacts from construction activities, new water quality criteria for nutrients and other pollutants, new wastewater analytical methods, and regulation of pesticide discharges. 
Cleanup of Solid and Hazardous Wastes
Liability for releases and cleanup of hazardous substances is imposed under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), and other federal and parallel state statutes. In a manner similar to many other industries and power systems, TVA has generated or used hazardous substances over the years.
TVA Sites.  TVA operations at some of its facilities have resulted in contamination that TVA is addressing including at TVA's Environmental Research Center at Muscle Shoals, Alabama. At September 30, 2019, TVA's estimated liability for cleanup and similar environmental work for those sites for which sufficient information was available to develop a cost estimate is approximately $15 million and was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, the ERC has an active groundwater monitoring program as part of a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") Corrective Action Permit.
Non-TVA Sites. TVA is aware of alleged hazardous-substance releases at certain non-TVA areas for which it may have some liability. See Note 22 — Commitments and Contingencies — Environmental Matters.
Coal Combustion Residuals. The EPA published its final rule governing CCR in April 2015. The rule regulates CCR as nonhazardous waste under Subtitle D of the RCRA. While states may adopt the rule's requirements into their regulatory programs, the rule does not require states to adopt the requirements. The initial version of the rule provided for self-implementation by utilities and allows enforcement through citizen suits in federal court. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act ("WIIN Act") subsequently allowed state or federal-based permitting to implement the CCR rule as an alternative to self-implementation and citizen suits. The rule, which became effective in October 2015, has later effective dates for certain provisions. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Generation Resources — Coal Combustion Residual Facilities for a discussion of the impact on TVA's operations, including the cost and timing estimates of related projects.

  In July 2018, the EPA issued a final rule which provided additional flexibility and an extension of certain deadlines. On March 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's request to remand this final rule to allow the EPA to reconsider the amendments to the CCR Rule. The remand also allows the EPA additional time to complete a new rulemaking to establish revised timelines for unlined impoundments to initiate closure and to reexamine the October 2020 deadline for closing some unlined impoundments. On August 14, 2019, the EPA issued a proposed rule to amend portions of the CCR Rule regarding beneficial use, temporary piles, and public access to information. As a result of these developments, it is not possible to predict potential impacts on TVA.
On November 4, 2019, the EPA announced a proposed rule that will revise portions of the CCR Rule requiring closure of unlined surface impoundments. This proposal, if finalized, will require all unlined CCR surface impoundments to stop receiving CCR and non-CCR wastestreams and to initiate closure by no later than August 31, 2020. The proposed rule would allow a utility to demonstrate the need for a short-term extension to continue to use the unlined CCR surface impoundment until November 30, 2020 if the alternative disposal capacity (i.e., new landfills or non-CCR water management systems) is not complete. Additionally, the proposed rule provides a process for a utility to seek site-specific approval from the EPA to continue to use the unlined CCR surface impoundment until no later than October 15, 2023. TVA does not currently anticipate the proposed rule will have a significant impact because TVA is already planning to close its unlined CCR surface impoundments.
In August 2015, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation ("TDEC") issued an order that (1) allowed TDEC to oversee TVA's implementation of the EPA's CCR rule and (2) required TVA to assess CCR contamination risks at seven of TVA's eight coal-fired plants in Tennessee and to remediate any unacceptable risks.  The TDEC order does not allege that TVA is violating any CCR regulatory requirements nor does it assess TVA penalties.  The TDEC order sets out an iterative process through which TVA and TDEC will identify and evaluate any CCR contamination risks and, if necessary, respond to such risks. 
TVA has been involved in two lawsuits concerning CCR facilities at Gallatin. These lawsuits have been resolved. See Note 22 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings — Lawsuit Brought by TDEC Involving Gallatin Fossil Plant CCR Facilities and Lawsuit Brought by TSRA and TCWN Involving Gallatin Fossil Plant CCR Facilities for additional information. 
Groundwater Contamination. Environmental groups and state regulatory agencies are increasing their attention on alleged groundwater contamination associated with CCR management activities. As a result, TVA may have to change how it manages CCR at some of its plants, potentially resulting in higher costs. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Generation Resources — Coal Combustion Residual Facilities, Note 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations, and Note 22 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings — Lawsuit Brought by TDEC Involving Gallatin Fossil Plant CCR Facilities and Lawsuit Brought by TSRA and TCWN Involving Gallatin Fossil Plant CCR Facilities. 
Environmental Investments
From 1970 to 2019, TVA spent approximately $6.8 billion on controls to reduce emissions from its coal-fired power plants. In addition, TVA has reduced emissions by idling or retiring coal-fired units and relying more on cleaner energy resources including natural gas and nuclear generation.
TVA currently anticipates spending significant amounts on environmental projects through 2024, including investments in new clean energy generation including renewables to reduce TVA's overall environmental footprint.  TVA environmental project expenditures also result from coal-fired plant decommissioning and from effective ash management modernization. Based on TVA's decisions regarding certain coal-fired units, the amount and timing of expenditures could change.  See Power Supply and Load Management Resources — Coal-Fired above and Estimated Required Environmental Expenditures below.
SO2 Emissions and NOx Emissions.  To reduce SO2 emissions, TVA operates scrubbers on 19 of its coal-fired units and switched to lower-sulfur coal at 13 coal-fired units. To reduce NOx emissions, TVA operates SCRs on 19 coal-fired units, operates low-NOx burners or low-NOx combustion systems on 19 units, operates over-fire air on one cyclone unit, optimized combustion on six units, and operates NOx control equipment year round when units are operating (except during start-up, shutdown, and maintenance periods). TVA has also retired 33 of 59 coal-fired units. Except for seven units at Shawnee, the remaining coal-fired units have scrubbers and SCRs. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources — Coal-Fired above.
Particulate Emissions. To reduce particulate emissions of air pollutants, TVA has equipped all of its coal-fired units with scrubbers, mechanical collectors, electrostatic precipitators, and/or bag houses.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions. There could be additional material costs if further reductions of GHGs, including CO2, are mandated by legislative, regulatory, or judicial actions and if more stringent emission reduction requirements for conventional pollutants are established. These costs cannot reasonably be predicted at this time because of the uncertainty of these actions. The EPA may issue regulations establishing more stringent air, water, and waste requirements, and these requirements could result in significant changes in the structure of the U.S. power industry, especially in the eastern half of the country.

TVA is continuing to evaluate the rules and their impact on its operations, including the cost and timing estimates of related projects. See Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Generation Resources — Coal Combustion Residual Facilities and Note 12 — Asset Retirement Obligations.
(6)  Includes air quality projects that TVA is currently performing to comply with existing air quality regulations, but does not include any projects that may be required to comply with potential GHG regulations or transmission upgrades.
(7)  Includes projects that TVA is currently planning to comply with revised rules under the Clean Water Act regarding CWIS and ELGs for steam electric power plants.
Employees
On September 30, 2019, TVA had 10,009 employees, of whom 3,415 were trades and labor employees.  Neither the federal labor relations laws covering most private sector employers nor those covering most federal agencies apply to TVA.  However, the TVA Board has a long-standing policy of acknowledging and working with recognized representatives of its employees, and that policy is reflected in long-term agreements to recognize the unions (or their successors) that represent TVA employees.  Federal law prohibits TVA employees from engaging in strikes against TVA.
