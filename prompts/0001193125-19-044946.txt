Item 1 | Business
-------+---------

 When we use the terms Innospec, the Corporation, the Company, Registrant, we, us and our, we are referring to Innospec Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. 
 General 
 Innospec develops, manufactures, blends, markets and supplies specialty chemicals for use as fuel additives, ingredients for personal care, home care, agrochemical, metal extraction and other applications and oilfield chemicals. Our products are sold primarily to oil and gas exploration and production companies, oil refiners, fuel manufacturers and users, formulators of personal care, home care, agrochemical and metal extraction formulations, and other chemical and industrial companies throughout the world. Our Fuel Specialties business helps improve fuel efficiency, boost engine performance and reduce harmful emissions. Our Oilfield Services business supplies drilling, completion and production chemicals which make exploration and production more effective, cost-efficient and environmentally friendly. Our performance chemicals provide effective technology-based solutions for our customers processes or products focused in the personal care, home care, agrochemical and metal extraction markets. Our Octane Additives business manufactures a fuel additive for use in automotive gasoline. 
Segment Information 
 The Company reports its financial performance based on the four reportable segments described as follows: 
 

 | Fuel Specialties
--+-----------------


 | Performance Chemicals
--+----------------------


 | Oilfield Services
--+------------------


 | Octane Additives
--+-----------------

 The Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Oilfield Services segments operate in markets where we actively seek growth opportunities although their ultimate customers are different. The Octane Additives segment is expected to further decline in the next twelve months as our one remaining refinery customer transitions to unleaded fuel. 
 For financial information about each of our segments, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Fuel Specialties 
 Our Fuel Specialties segment develops, manufactures, blends, markets and supplies a range of specialty chemical products used as additives to a wide range of fuels. These fuel additive

  products help improve fuel efficiency, boost engine performance and reduce harmful emissions; and are used in the efficient operation of automotive, marine and aviation engines, power station generators, and heating oil. 
 The segment has grown organically through our development of new products to address what we believe are the key drivers in demand for fuel additives. These drivers include increased demand for fuel, focus on fuel economy, changing engine technology and legislative developments. We have also devoted substantial resources towards the development of new and improved products that may be used to improve combustion efficiency. 
 Our customers in this segment include national oil companies, multinational oil companies and fuel retailers. 
 Performance Chemicals 
 Our Performance Chemicals segment provides effective technology-based solutions for our customers processes or products focused in the Personal Care, Home Care, Agrochemical and Metal Extraction markets. 
 This segment has grown through acquisitions, and the development and marketing of innovative products. The focus for our Performance Chemicals segment is to develop high performance products from its technology base in a number of targeted markets. 
 Our customers in this segment include large multinational companies, manufacturers of personal care and household products and specialty chemical manufacturers operating in agrochemical, metal extraction and other industrial applications. 
 Oilfield Services 
 Our Oilfield Services segment develops and markets products to prevent loss of mud in drilling operations, chemical solutions for fracturing, stimulation and completion operations and products for oil and gas production which aid flow assurance and maintain asset integrity. 
 This segment has recently been growing strongly, driven by increased customer activity, as the industry recovers from the significant declines of the last two years. 
 Our customers in this segment include multinational public and independent companies operating currently principally in the Americas. 
 Octane Additives 
 Our Octane Additives segment, which we believe is the worlds only producer of tetra ethyl lead (TEL), comprises sales of TEL for use in automotive gasoline and provides services in respect of environmental remediation. We are continuing to responsibly manage the decline in the demand for TEL for use in automotive gasoline in line with the transition plans to unleaded gasoline for our one remaining refinery customer. Cost improvement measures continue to be taken to respond to declining market demand.

 Sales of TEL for use in automotive gasoline are principally made to state-owned refineries located in North Africa. Our environmental remediation business manages the cleanup of redundant TEL facilities as refineries complete the transition to unleaded gasoline. 
 Strategy 
 Our strategy is to develop new and improved products and technologies to continue to strengthen and increase our market positions within our Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Oilfield Services segments. We also actively continue to assess potential strategic acquisitions, partnerships and other opportunities that would enhance and expand our customer offering. We focus on opportunities that would extend our technology base, geographical coverage or product portfolio. We believe that focusing on the Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Oilfield Services segments, in which the Company has existing experience, expertise and knowledge, provides opportunities for positive returns on investment with reduced operating risk. We also continue to develop our geographical footprint, consistent with the development of global markets. 
Geographical Area Information 
 Financial information with respect to our domestic and foreign operations is contained in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Working Capital 
 The nature of our customers businesses generally requires us to hold appropriate amounts of inventory in order to be able to respond quickly to customers needs. We therefore require corresponding amounts of working capital for normal operations. We do not believe that this is materially different to what our competitors do, with the exception of cetane number improvers, in which case we maintain high enough levels of inventory, as required, to retain our position as market leader in sales of these products. 
 The purchase of large amounts of certain raw materials across all our segments can create some variations in working capital requirements, but these are planned and managed by the business. 
 We do not believe that our terms of sale, or purchase, differ markedly from those of our competitors. 
 Raw Materials and Product Supply 
 We use a variety of raw materials and chemicals in our manufacturing and blending processes and believe that sources for these are adequate for our current operations. Our major purchases are cetane number improvers, ethylene, various solvents, amines, alcohols, olefin and polyacrylamides.

 These purchases account for a substantial portion of the Companys variable manufacturing costs. These materials are, with the exception of ethylene for one of our operations in Germany, readily available from more than one source. Although ethylene is, in theory, available from several sources, it is not permissible to transport ethylene by road in Germany. As a result, we source ethylene via a direct pipeline from a neighboring site, making it effectively a single source. Ethylene is used as a primary raw material in products representing approximately 5% of Innospecs sales. 
 We use long-term contracts (generally with fixed or formula-based costs) and advance bulk purchases to help ensure availability and continuity of supply, and to manage the risk of cost increases. From time to time, for some raw materials, the risk of cost increases is managed with commodity swaps. 
 We continue to monitor the situation and adjust our procurement strategies as we deem appropriate. The Company forecasts its raw material requirements substantially in advance, and seeks to build long-term relationships and contractual positions with supply partners to safeguard its raw material positions. In addition, the Company operates an extensive risk management program which seeks to source key raw materials from multiple sources and to develop suitable contingency plans. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents and licenses, forms a significant part of the Companys competitive advantage, particularly in the Fuel Specialties, Oilfield Specialties and Performance Chemicals segments. The Company does not, however, consider its business as a whole to be dependent on any one trademark, patent or license. 
 The Company has a portfolio of trademarks and patents, both granted and in the application stage, covering products and processes in several jurisdictions. The majority of these patents were developed by the Company and, subject to maintenance obligations including the payment of renewal fees, have at least 10 years life remaining. 
 The trademark Innospec and the Innospec device in Classes 1, 2 and 4 of the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks are registered in all jurisdictions in which the Company has a significant market presence. The Company also has trademark registrations for certain product names in all jurisdictions in which it has a significant market presence. 
 We actively protect our inventions, new technologies, and product developments by filing patent applications and maintaining trade secrets. In addition, we vigorously participate in patent opposition proceedings around the world where necessary to secure a technology base free from infringement of our intellectual property. 
 We have sales contracts with customers in some markets using fixed or formula-based prices, as appropriate, to maintain our gross profits.

 Competition 
 Certain markets in which the Company operates are subject to significant competition. The Company competes on the basis of a number of factors including, but not limited to, product quality and performance, specialized product lines, customer relationships and service, and regulatory expertize. 
 Fuel Specialties: Within the Fuel Specialties segment, the market is generally characterized by a small number of competitors, none of which hold a dominant position. We consider our competitive edge to be our proven technical development capacity, independence from major oil companies and strong long-term customer relationships. 
 Performance Chemicals: Within the Performance Chemicals segment we operate in the Personal Care, Home Care, Agrochemical and Metal Extraction markets which are highly fragmented, and the Company experiences substantial competition from a large number of multinational and specialty chemical suppliers in each geographical market. Our competitive position in these markets is based on us supplying a superior, diverse product portfolio which solves particular customer problems or enhances the performance of new or existing products. In a number of specialty chemicals markets, we also supply niche product lines, where we enjoy market-leading positions. 
 Oilfield Services: Our Oilfield Services segment is very fragmented and although there are a small number of very large competitors, there are also a large number of smaller players focused on specific technologies or regions. Our competitive strength is our proven technology, broad regional coverage and strong customer relationships. 
 Octane Additives: We believe our Octane Additives segment is the worlds only producer of TEL and accordingly is the only supplier of TEL for use in automotive gasoline. The segment therefore competes with marketers of products and processes that provide alternative ways of enhancing octane performance in automotive gasoline. 
 Research, Development, Testing and Technical Support 
 Research, product/application development and technical support (R&D) provide the basis for the growth of our Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Oilfield Services segments. Accordingly, the Companys R&D activity has been, and will continue to be, focused on the development of new products and formulations. Our R&D department provides technical support for all of our reporting segments. Expenditures to support R&D services were $33.4 million, $31.4 million and $25.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 We believe that our proven technical capabilities provide us with a significant competitive advantage. In the last five years, the Fuel Specialties segment has developed new detergents, cold flow improvers, stabilizers, lubricity and combustion improver products, in addition to the introduction of many new cost effective fuel additive packages. This proven technical capability has also been instrumental in enabling us to produce innovative products including Iselux and Statsafe®.

 Health, Safety and Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to environmental laws in the countries in which we operate and conduct business. Management believes that the Company is in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and has made the necessary provisions for the continued costs of compliance with environmental laws. 
 Our principal site giving rise to environmental remediation liabilities is the Octane Additives manufacturing site at Ellesmere Port in the United Kingdom. There are also environmental remediation liabilities on a much smaller scale in respect of our other manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Europe. At Ellesmere Port there is a continuing asset retirement program related to certain manufacturing units that have been closed. 
 We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when they are probable and costs can be reasonably estimated, and asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation and costs can be reasonably estimated. This involves anticipating the program of work and the associated future expected costs, and so involves the exercise of judgment by management. We regularly review the future expected costs of remediation and the current estimate is reflected in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The European Union legislation known as the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemical Substances Regulations (REACH) requires most of the Companys products to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency. Under this legislation the Company has to demonstrate that its products are appropriate for their intended purposes. During this registration process, the Company incurs expense to test and register its products. The Company estimates that the cost of complying with REACH will be approximately $3 million over the next three years based on the current regulatory environment. However, should the United Kingdom exit the European Union under certain terms, these costs may increase. 
 Employees 
 The Company had approximately 2000 employees in 23 countries as at December 31, 2018.
