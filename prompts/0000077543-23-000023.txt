ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Tutor Perini Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Tutor Perini,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” unless the context indicates otherwise) is a leading construction company, based on revenue as ranked by Engineering News-Record (“ENR”), offering diversified general contracting, construction management and design-build services to private customers and public agencies throughout the world. The Company was formed through the 2008 merger between Tutor-Saliba Corporation and Perini Corporation (“Perini”) and our legacy dates to 1894, when Perini's predecessor businesses began providing construction services. Our corporate headquarters are in Los Angeles (Sylmar), California, and we have various other principal offices throughout the United States and its territories (see Item 2. Properties for a listing of our major facilities). Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “TPC.” We are incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
We have established a strong reputation within our markets for executing large, complex projects on time and within budget while adhering to strict quality control measures. We offer general contracting, pre-construction planning and comprehensive project management services, including the planning and scheduling of the manpower, equipment, materials and subcontractors required for a project. We also offer self-performed construction services including site work; concrete forming and placement; steel erection; electrical; mechanical; plumbing; heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); and fire protection. During 2022, we performed work on more than 1,300 construction projects.
In 2022, ENR ranked Tutor Perini as the 13th largest domestic contractor. We are recognized as one of the leading civil contractors in the United States, as evidenced by our performance on several of the country’s largest mass-transit and transportation projects, such as Newark Liberty International Airport Terminal A (“Newark Airport Terminal A”), the East Side Access project in New York City, the California High-Speed Rail System, the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement (the “SR 99”) project in Seattle, major portions of the Red Line and Purple Line segments of the Los Angeles Metro subway system, and the San Francisco Central Subway extension to Chinatown. We are also recognized as one of the major building contractors in the United States, as evidenced by our performance on several of the country’s largest building development projects, including Hudson Yards in New York City and CityCenter and the Cosmopolitan Resort and Casino, both in Las Vegas.
Our strengths and expertise in the construction of civil and building infrastructure projects have been augmented by our vertical integration capabilities, which we established more than 10 years ago through the acquisitions of various business entities specializing in electrical, mechanical, plumbing, HVAC and other services that enhanced our market capabilities and expanded our geographic presence. Our vertical integration is a competitive advantage that allows us to self-perform a greater amount of work than our competitors. It also increases our competitiveness in bidding and our efficiency in managing and executing large, complex projects, and provides us with significant cross-selling opportunities across a broad geographic footprint.
Business Segment Overview
Our business is conducted through three segments: Civil, Building and Specialty Contractors.
Civil Segment
Our Civil segment specializes in public works construction and the replacement and reconstruction of infrastructure across several major geographic regions of the United States. Our civil contracting services include construction and rehabilitation of highways, bridges, tunnels, mass-transit systems, military defense facilities, and water management and wastewater treatment facilities.
The Civil segment is comprised of the heavy civil construction operations of our predecessors, Tutor-Saliba Corporation, its subsidiary Black Construction, and Perini, as well as our acquired companies, Frontier-Kemper, Lunda Construction and Becho. Our heavy civil units operate primarily on the West and East Coasts of the United States and are engaged in a variety of large mass-transit, tunneling, bridge and highway projects. Black Construction is the largest contractor in Guam and provides a variety of heavy civil, building, mechanical and electrical construction services throughout the Western Pacific region and in other strategic military locations. Frontier-Kemper is a heavy civil contractor engaged in the construction of tunnels for highways, railroads, subways and rapid transit systems; the construction of shafts and other facilities for water supply, wastewater transport and hydroelectric projects; and the development and equipping of mines with innovative hoisting, elevator and vertical conveyance systems. Lunda Construction is a heavy civil contractor specializing in the construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of bridges, railroads and other civil structures throughout the United States. Becho is engaged in drilling, foundation and excavation support for shoring, bridges, piers, roads and highway projects, primarily in the southwestern United States.
In its 2022 rankings, ENR ranked us as the nation’s third largest contractor in the transportation market and third largest domestic heavy contractor.
Our Civil segment’s customers primarily award contracts through one of two methods: the traditional public “competitive bid” method, in which price is the major determining factor, or through a best value proposal, where contracts are awarded based on a combination of technical qualifications, proposed project team, schedule, past performance on similar projects and price.
Traditionally, our Civil segment’s customers require each contractor to pre-qualify for construction business by meeting criteria that include technical capabilities and financial strength. Our financial strength, outstanding record of performance on challenging civil works projects, and vertical integration capabilities often enable us to pre-qualify for projects in situations where smaller, less diversified contractors are unable to meet the qualification requirements. We believe this is a competitive advantage that allows us to self-perform a greater amount of work and makes us an ideal lead contractor for the largest, most complex infrastructure projects and on prestigious design-build, design-build-operate-maintain and public-private partnership projects.
We have been active in civil construction since 1894 and believe we have a particular expertise in large, complex civil construction projects. We have completed, or are currently working on, some of the most significant civil construction projects in the United States. For example, we are currently nearing completion on the Newark Airport Terminal A project and the East Side Access project in New York City, and we have substantially completed the San Francisco Central Subway extension to Chinatown. Additionally, we are working on the first phase of the California High-Speed Rail project, the Purple Line Segments 2 and 3 expansion projects in Los Angeles and the Minneapolis Southwest Light Rail Transit project. We have also completed other major projects such as the SR 99 project in Seattle; the platform over the eastern rail yard at Hudson Yards in New York City; the rehabilitation of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York; and multiple runway reconstruction projects at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Los Angeles International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, among others.
We believe the Civil segment provides us with significant opportunities for growth due to the condition of existing infrastructure coupled with large government funding sources dedicated to the replacement and reconstruction of aging U.S. infrastructure. In addition, infrastructure programs generally garner popular, bipartisan support from the public and elected officials due to their favorable long-term economic impacts, including significant job creation. Funding for major Civil segment infrastructure projects is typically provided through a combination of one or more of the following: local, regional, state and federal loans and grants; other direct allocations sourced through tax revenue; bonds; user fees; and, for certain projects, private capital. 
On November 15, 2021, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (the “Bipartisan Infrastructure Law” or “BIL”) was enacted into law, providing $1.2 trillion of federal infrastructure funding, including $550 billion in new spending 
for improvements to the country’s surface-transportation network and enhancements to core infrastructure. The BIL marks the largest federal investment in public transit ever, the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system and the largest federal investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak, all in addition to providing for regular annual spending for numerous infrastructure projects. This significant incremental funding is already being allocated to numerous major projects and is anticipated to be spent over approximately 10 years from the BIL’s passage, with much of it targeted toward end markets that are directly aligned with our market focus. Accordingly, we believe that this significant level of sustained, incremental funding will favorably impact our current work and prospective opportunities over the next decade.
Building Segment
Our Building segment has significant experience providing services to several specialized building markets for private and public works customers, including hospitality and gaming, transportation, health care, commercial offices, government facilities, sports and entertainment, education, correctional facilities, biotech, pharmaceutical, industrial and technology. We believe the success of the Building segment results from our proven ability to manage and perform large, complex projects with aggressive fast-track schedules, elaborate designs, and advanced mechanical, electrical and life safety systems, while providing accurate budgeting and strict quality control. Although price is a key competitive factor, we believe our strong reputation, long-standing customer relationships and significant level of repeat and referral business have enabled us to achieve a leading position in the marketplace.
We are a recognized leader in the hospitality and gaming market, specializing in the construction of high-end resorts and casinos. We work with hotel operators, Native American tribal councils, developers and architectural firms to provide diversified construction services to meet the challenges of new construction and renovation of hotel and resort properties. We believe that our reputation for completing projects on time is a significant competitive advantage in this market, as any delay in project completion could result in significant loss of revenue for the customer.
The Building segment is comprised of several operating units that provide general contracting, design-build, preconstruction and construction services in various regions of the United States. Rudolph and Sletten, one of our general contracting firms, focuses on large, complex projects in California in the health care, commercial office, technology, industrial, education, and government facilities markets. Tutor Perini Building Corp. focuses on large, complex building projects nationwide, including significant projects in the hospitality and gaming, commercial office, education, government facilities, and multi-unit residential markets. Roy Anderson Corp. provides general contracting services, including major disaster response and reconstruction support, to public and private customers primarily throughout the southeastern United States. Perini Management Services provides diversified construction and design-build services internationally to U.S. government agencies, as well as to surety companies and multi-national corporations.
We have completed, or are currently working on, various large private and public building projects across a wide array of end markets. Specific projects include Newark Airport Terminal A; the LAX Airport Metro Connector Transit Station in Los Angeles, California; three large corporate office buildings in northern California for distinct confidential technology customers; a commercial office tower and a multi-unit residential tower, both at Hudson Yards in New York City; the new Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Marina Del Rey, California; Kaiser Hospital buildings in San Leandro, Redwood City and Roseville, California; the Choctaw Casino and Resort in Durant, Oklahoma; the Pechanga Resort and Casino expansion in Temecula, California; the O Street Government Office Building in Sacramento, California; and courthouses in San Bernardino and San Diego, California and Broward County, Florida. As a result of our reputation and track record, we were previously awarded and completed contracts for several marquee hospitality and gaming projects in Las Vegas, including CityCenter, the Cosmopolitan Resort and Casino and the Wynn Encore Hotel. These projects span a wide array of building end markets and illustrate our Building segment’s résumé of successfully completed large-scale public and private projects.
Specialty Contractors Segment
Our Specialty Contractors segment specializes in electrical, mechanical, plumbing, HVAC and fire protection systems for a full range of civil and building construction projects in the industrial, commercial, hospitality and gaming, and mass-transit end markets. This segment provides unique strengths and vertically integrated service capabilities that position us as a full-service contractor with greater control over project bids and costs, scheduled work, project delivery and risk management. The majority of work performed by the Specialty Contractors segment is contracted directly with state and local municipal agencies, real estate developers, school districts and other commercial and industrial customers. A significant portion of the segment's work has been, and is expected to continue to be, performed for our Civil and Building segments.
The Specialty Contractors segment is comprised of several operating units that provide unique services in various regions of the United States. Five Star Electric Corp. (“Five Star”) is an industry leader and one of the largest electrical contractors in New 
York City. Five Star provides construction services, including power, lighting, fire alarm, security, telecommunications, low voltage and wireless systems to both the public and private sectors. These services are provided across end markets that include multi-unit residential, hotels, commercial offices, industrial, mass transit, education, retail, sports and entertainment, health care and water treatment. Fisk Electric (“Fisk”) covers many of the major commercial, transportation and industrial electrical construction markets in California and the southern United States, with the ability to cover other attractive markets nationwide. Fisk’s expertise is in the design and development of electrical and technology systems for major projects spanning a broad variety of project types, including commercial office buildings, sports arenas, hospitals, research laboratories, hotels and casinos, convention centers, manufacturing plants, refineries, and water and wastewater treatment facilities. WDF, Nagelbush and Desert Mechanical each provide mechanical, plumbing, HVAC and fire protection services to a range of customers in a wide variety of markets, including transportation, commercial/industrial, schools and universities and residential. WDF is one of the largest mechanical contractors serving the New York City metropolitan region. Nagelbush operates primarily in Florida and Desert Mechanical operates primarily in the western United States.
Our Specialty Contractors business units have completed, or are currently working on, various portions of the East Side Access project in New York City, various projects at the World Trade Center and at Hudson Yards in New York City, and upgrades and rehabilitations at various New York City public housing facilities. The Specialty Contractors segment has also supported, or is currently supporting, several large projects in our Civil and Building segments, including the SR 99 project in Seattle; the San Francisco Central Subway extension to Chinatown; the Purple Line Segments 2 and 3 expansion projects in Los Angeles; Newark Airport Terminal A; the California High Speed Rail project in central California; McCarran International Airport Terminal 3 in Las Vegas; and several marquee hospitality and gaming projects in Las Vegas, including CityCenter, the Cosmopolitan Resort and Casino, and the Wynn Encore Hotel.

In addition, financial information about geographic areas is discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Backlog
Backlog in our industry is a measure of the total value of work that is remaining to be performed on projects that have been awarded. We include a construction project in our backlog when a contract is awarded or when we have otherwise received written definitive notice that the project has been awarded to us and there are no remaining major uncertainties that the project will proceed (e.g., adequate funding is in place). As a result, we believe our backlog is firm, and although cancellations or scope adjustments may occur, historically they have not been material. We estimate that approximately $4 billion, or 45%, of our backlog as of December 31, 2022 will be recognized as revenue in 2023. Our backlog by segment, end market, customer type and contract type is presented in the following tables:

Competition
While the construction markets include numerous competitors, especially for small to mid-sized projects, much of the work that we target is for larger, more complex projects where there are typically fewer active market participants due to the greater capabilities and resources required to perform the work. In addition to domestic competitors, we have seen certain foreign competitors attempting to grow their presence in the United States over the past several years, particularly through the pursuit of large Civil segment projects. Evolving changes in the construction industry, such as the trend toward an increased use of the progressive design-build project delivery method that may reduce project risks for both owners and contractors, could result in increased competition and potentially lower margins on certain projects in the future. We believe price, experience, reputation, responsiveness, customer relationships, project completion track record, schedule control, risk management and quality of work are key factors customers consider when awarding contracts.
In our Civil segment, we compete principally with large civil construction firms, including (alphabetically) Dragados USA; Fluor Corporation; Granite Construction; Kiewit Corporation; OHL USA; Skanska USA; and The Walsh Group. In our Building segment, we compete with a variety of national and regional contractors, including (alphabetically) AECOM (through its acquisitions of Tishman Construction and Hunt Construction Group); Balfour Beatty Construction; Clark Construction Group; DPR Construction; Gilbane, Inc.; Hensel Phelps Construction Co.; Lendlease Corporation; McCarthy Building Companies, Inc.; M. A. Mortenson Company; PCL Constructors, Inc.; Skanska USA; Suffolk Construction; Swinerton, Inc; Turner Construction Company; and The Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. In our Specialty Contractors segment, we compete principally with various regional and local electrical, mechanical and plumbing subcontractors.
Construction Costs
We strive to eliminate or minimize exposure to labor and material price increases in our project bids and the manner in which we execute our work. Generally, if prices for materials, labor or equipment increase excessively, provisions in certain types of contracts often shift all or a major portion of any adverse impact to the customer. In our fixed price contracts, we attempt to insulate ourselves from the unfavorable effects of inflation, when possible, by incorporating escalating wage and price assumptions into our construction cost estimates, by obtaining firm fixed price quotes from major subcontractors and material suppliers, by securing purchase commitments for materials early in the project schedule and by including contingency for these risks in our bid price. Construction and other materials used in our construction activities are generally available locally from multiple sources. Despite the widespread adverse supply chain impacts that resulted from the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, we did not experience significant supply chain issues broadly across our portfolio of projects, but we cannot be certain that such issues may not arise in the future if there are new outbreaks or variants of COVID-19 or other public health crises. Labor resources for our domestic projects are largely obtained through various labor unions. We have not experienced significant labor shortages in recent years, nor do we expect to in the near future. However, longer-term, the anticipated significant increase in demand for large complex projects driven by the BIL could lead to labor shortages.
Seasonality
We experience seasonal trends in our business. Our revenue and operating income are typically higher in the second half of the year. Our first fiscal quarter of the year is typically our lowest revenue quarter, as the harsher winter weather conditions that often occur during this period can negatively impact our ability to execute work and our productivity in parts of North America. Our revenue typically increases during the high construction seasons of the summer and fall months in the United States. Within the United States, as well as in other parts of the world, our business generally benefits from milder weather conditions during our third fiscal quarter, which allows for more productivity from our on-site construction operations. For these reasons, it is not unusual for us to experience seasonal changes or fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.
Government Contracts 
Most of our federal, state and local government customers can terminate, renegotiate, or modify any of their contracts with us at their election, and many of our federal government contracts are subject to renewal or extension periodically. Revenue derived from federal, state and local government customers was 68%, 66% and 63% of our total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
Environmental, health and safety regulations and requirements materially affect our business. We are firmly committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for our employees and to working in a manner that ensures the safety of our subcontractors, customers and the general public, as well as the protection of facilities, equipment and the environment. Compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and other health and safety regulations, in particular, is essential to procure business and to attract and retain our workforce. Accordingly, we make considerable investments in our environmental, health and safety programs, and we factor costs associated with compliance into our project bids and proposals. 
We provide construction and construction management services at various project sites, and sometimes perform work in and around sensitive environmental areas, such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. We also handle small quantities of hazardous materials on occasion. Significant fines, penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, and some laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances. 
Contaminants have been detected at some of the sites that we own and where we have worked as a contractor in the past, and we have incurred costs for the investigation and remediation of hazardous substances. However, we do not own the job sites 
upon which we perform our work. We have pollution liability insurance coverage for such matters, and if applicable, we seek indemnification from customers to cover the risks associated with environmental remediation. Accordingly, we believe that our environmental liabilities are not material. In addition, we continually evaluate our compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with those laws and regulations.
Insurance and Bonding
All of our properties and equipment, as well as those of our joint ventures, are covered by insurance in amounts that we believe are consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice. Our wholly owned subsidiary, PCR Insurance Company, issues policies for default insurance for our subcontractors, automobile liability, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance, allowing us to centralize our claims and risk management functions to reduce our insurance-related costs.
As a normal part of the construction business, we are often required to provide various types of surety bonds as an additional level of security for our performance. We also require many of our higher-risk subcontractors to provide surety bonds as security for payment of subcontractors and suppliers and to guarantee their performance. As an alternative to traditional surety bonds, we also have purchased subcontractor default insurance for certain construction projects to insure against the risk of subcontractor default.
Human Capital Resources
The foundation of our continuing success as a leading construction services business is our ability to attract and retain the industry’s best talent by providing a culture of opportunity, development, accountability and empowerment. This understanding guides our approach to managing our human capital resources.
Employees. Our principal asset is our employees, many of whom have technical and professional backgrounds and undergraduate and/or advanced degrees. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 8,100 employees (including union employees), of which approximately 1,900 were salaried and 6,200 were hourly employees. The number of employees at any given time depends on the volume and types of active projects in progress, as well as our position within the lifecycle of those projects. We believe that we have strong relationships with our employees and that the quality and level of service that our employees deliver to our customers are among the highest in our industry.
Diversity and Inclusion. A diverse workforce provides a broader perspective on the challenges our customers look to us to solve. To excel as a business, we must continue to hire the best talent and secure the full participation and commitment of all employees. Our culture is to always treat people with respect, dignity and fairness. Historically, women have represented a small percentage of workers in the construction industry. This sometimes presents challenges, as well as opportunities, in attracting and recruiting women to our workforce. Women made up 11.3% of our U.S. workforce as of December 31, 2022, which is in line with the representation of women in the U.S. construction workforce at large of 10.9%, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”). Racial and ethnic minorities represented about half of our U.S. construction workforce as of December 31, 2022, which is generally in line with BLS data. 
Union Workforce. We are signatory to numerous local and regional collective bargaining agreements, both directly and through trade associations, as a union contractor. These agreements cover all necessary union crafts and are subject to various renewal dates. As of December 31, 2022, our workforce included a total of approximately 3,700 union employees. Estimated amounts for wage escalation related to the expiration of union contracts are included in our bids on various projects; accordingly, the expiration of any union contract in the next year is not expected to have any material impact on us. During the past several years, we have not experienced any significant work stoppages caused by our union employees.
Talent Recruitment, Training and Retention. Our business relies upon an adequate supply of management, supervisory and field personnel. Recruiting, training and retaining key personnel have been and will remain primary goals of our human capital initiatives. Through the use of management information systems, on-the-job training and educational seminars, employees are trained to understand the importance of project execution. We place a strong emphasis on training employees in accurate and comprehensive project estimating, project management and project cost control. As is common in our industry, we experience some recurring employee turnover each year, which we believe is comparable to the industry average. Historically, we have successfully attracted and retained sufficient numbers of personnel, including union personnel, to support our operational needs. We strive to ensure a fully competent project management team that includes long-term successors to our current project leaders by investing significant resources to build strong and highly competent project managers. We regularly hire construction management and engineering staff, including interns and recent graduates, and provide them with engaging projects and development programs. On the occasion when we have a need for senior project executives, the broad professional network of our leadership team often provides strong candidates to fill those needs. We also utilize internal and external 
recruiting specialists to help fill our open job positions. To support retention and motivation of our top talent, we provide very competitive compensation, which may include performance incentives.
Workplace Safety. We place a strong emphasis on the safety of our employees, our customers and the public. Accordingly, we conduct extensive safety training programs that have allowed us to maintain a high safety level at our worksites. All newly hired employees that will be working at project job sites undergo an initial safety orientation, and for certain types of projects or processes we conduct specific hazard training programs. Our project supervisors regularly conduct on-site safety meetings, and our safety managers make random site safety inspections and perform daily assessments. In addition, operational employees are required to complete an OSHA 30-hour training program and project-specific courses on various safety topics. Moreover, we promote a culture of safety by encouraging employees to recognize, immediately correct and report all unsafe conditions. To underscore the importance of safety, a portion of annual performance bonus compensation for certain executive management is directly linked to the achievement of a key safety metric. Our strong overall safety performance also helps to reduce our insurance-related costs.
