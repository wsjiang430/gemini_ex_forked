Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

COMPANY OVERVIEW
 Unless the context otherwise indicates or requires, as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “ADS” and the “Company” refer to Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. and its directly- and indirectly-owned subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where it is clear that the terms mean only Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. exclusive of its subsidiaries. 
 We are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the underground construction and infrastructure marketplace. Our broad product line includes corrugated high-density polyethylene (or “HDPE”) pipe, polypropylene (or “PP”) pipe and related water management products. Our products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe has been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In the United States, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and broad product offering make us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the ADS brand has long been associated with quality products and market-leading performance. Our trademarked green stripe, which is prominently displayed on many of our products, serves as clear identification of our commitment to the customers and markets we serve. 
 We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $11 billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity. We believe our extensive national footprint in the United States creates a cost and service advantage versus our HDPE pipe producing competitors, the largest of which has only 9 HDPE pipe manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Canada and, according to the December 24, 2018 ranking by Plastics News of Pipe, Profile & Tubing Extruders, recently had estimated sales of $140 million, or approximately ten times less than our net sales in fiscal 2019.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
 For a discussion of segment and geographic information, see “Note 21. Business Segment Information” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
OUR MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION PLATFORM
 We have a leading domestic and international manufacturing and distribution infrastructure, serving customers in all 50 U.S. states as well as approximately 80 other countries through 56 manufacturing plants and 32 distribution centers, including 8 manufacturing plants and 5 distribution centers owned or leased by our joint ventures. We manufacture our corrugated pipe products in 17 different diameters ranging from 2” to 60” using a continuous extrusion process, where molten polyethylene or polypropylene is pushed through a die into a moving series of corrugated U-shaped molds. Blown air and vacuum are used to form the corrugations of the pipe which is pulled through a corrugator and then cut to length. We utilize customized and proprietary production equipment, which we believe is faster and more cost efficient than other pipe making equipment generally available in the market.
 Domestically, we are capable of producing more than one billion pounds of pipe annually on a standard five-day per week schedule. Additional capacity is in place to support seasonal production needs and expected growth. Our production equipment is built to accept transportable molds and die tooling over a certain range of sizes so each plant is not required to house the full range of tooling at any given time. This transportability provides us with the flexibility to optimize our capacity through centrally coordinated production planning, which helps to adapt to shifting sales demand patterns while reducing the capital needed for tooling. With our large manufacturing footprint in place, we can support rapid seasonal growth in demand, focusing on customer service while minimizing transportation costs.
 The standard fittings products (tees, wyes, elbows, etc.) that we produce and sell to connect our pipe on jobsites are blow molded or injection molded at three domestic plants. In addition, customized fabricated fittings (e.g., more complex dual wall pipe reducers, bends or structures) are produced in 20 of our North American plants. 
 4


Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
 
In addition to the extrusion of pipe, and blow molding and injection molding of fittings, we also use a variety of other processes in our manufacturing facilities. These processes include thermoforming, compression molding, and custom plastic welding and fabrication. The wide variety of production processes and expertise allow us to provide cost-effective finished goods at competitive prices delivered in a timely fashion to our customers.
 Our manufacturing plants have no process-related by-products released into the atmosphere, waterways, or solid waste discharge. During pipe production start-ups and size changeovers, non-compliant scrap and any damaged finished goods pipe are recycled through a grinder for internal re-use.
 International Presence – We own manufacturing facilities in Canada to produce our products for sale in the Canadian markets. We serve international markets primarily in Mexico and South America through joint ventures with local partners. Our joint venture strategy has provided us with local and regional access to key markets such as Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Peru. Our international joint ventures produce pipe and related products to be sold in their respective regional markets. We also have wholly-owned subsidiaries that distribute our pipe and related products in Europe and the Middle East. Combining local partners’ customer relationships, brand recognition and local management talent, with our world-class manufacturing and process expertise, broad product portfolio and innovation creates a powerful platform and exciting opportunities for continued profitable international expansion.
 Quality Control - We have two internal quality control laboratory facilities equipped and staffed to evaluate and confirm incoming raw material and finished goods quality in addition to the quality testing that is done at our manufacturing facilities. We conduct annual safety, product and process quality audits at each of our facilities, using centralized internal resources in combination with external third-party services. In the quality area, various national agencies such as National Transportation Product Evaluation Program (“NTPEP”), International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (“IAPMO”), Bureau de normalisation du Québec (“BNQ”), Intertek for Canadian Standards Association (“CSA”), Entidad Mexicana de Acreditacion A.C. (“EMA”) and NSF International and numerous state Departments of Transportation (“DOT”) and municipal authorities conduct both scheduled and unscheduled inspections of our plants to verify product quality and compliance to applicable standards.
 Training - Core to our commitment and enablement of a safe and productive manufacturing environment are our operational and management training programs. Through our ADS Academy, we deliver targeted role-specific training to our operations team members through a blended curriculum of online and hands-on training experiences covering safety, quality, product knowledge and manufacturing process. Our learning management system, which hosts over 600 custom modules, serves as the foundation of our operational training programs and provides us with appropriate scale, efficiency, and governance to support our growth. We have a strong commitment to the training of our manufacturing supervisors and managers in technical, management, and leadership subjects through intense role-based assimilation plans, e-learning and classroom-based development experiences.
 Fleet - We also operate an in-house fleet of approximately 700 tractors. Our effective shipping radius is between approximately 300 to 350 miles from one of our manufacturing plants or distribution centers. The combination of a dedicated fleet and team of company drivers allows greater flexibility and responsiveness in meeting dynamic customer jobsite delivery expectations. We strive to achieve less than three-day lead-time on deliveries and have the added benefit of redeploying fleet and driver assets to respond to short-term regional spikes in sales activity. For deliveries that are outside an economic delivery radius of our truck fleet, common carrier deliveries are tendered using a customized software platform to ensure that lowest delivered freight costs are achieved. In addition, in the United States and Canada, approximately 11% of our pipe volume is sold on a pick-up or walk-in basis at our plant and yard locations, further leveraging our footprint and lowering freight cost per pound and per revenue dollar.
 Our North American truck fleet incorporates approximately 1,250 trailers that are specially designed to haul our lightweight pipe and fittings products. These designs maximize payload versus conventional over the road trailers and facilitate unassisted unloading of our products at the jobsites by our drivers. The scope of fleet operations also includes backhaul of purchased raw materials providing a lower delivered cost to our plant locations.
 Facility Network - Our scale and extensive network of facilities provide a critical cost advantage versus our competitors, as we are able to more efficiently transport products to our customers and end users and to promote faster product shipments due to our proximity to the delivery location.

Pipe | | 72 | % | | 72 | % | 72 | %
Allied Products | | 28 | % | | 28 | % | 28 | %

Pipe
 Dual Wall Corrugated Pipe - Our N-12 pipe is a dual wall HDPE pipe with a corrugated exterior for strength and a smooth interior wall for hydraulics and flow capacity. Our N-12 pipe competes in the storm sewer and drainage markets that are also served by concrete pipe.
 Our N-12 pipe is available in 17 different diameters ranging from 2” to 60” and in sections ranging from 10’ to 30’ in length. N-12 provides joint integrity, with integral bell and spigot joints for fast push-together installation, and is sold either with watertight or soil-tight coupling and fitting systems.
 Our corrugated polyethylene pipe offers many benefits including ease of installation, job-site handling and resistance to corrosion and abrasion. Corrugated pipe can easily be cut or coupled together, providing precise laying lengths while minimizing installation waste and difficulty.
 HP Storm Pipe and SaniTite HP Pipe - Our HP Storm pipe utilizes polypropylene resin, which provides (i) increased pipe stiffness relative to HDPE; (ii) higher Environmental Stress Crack Resistance (“ESCR”); and (iii) improved thermal properties, which improves joint performance. These improved physical characteristics result in a reduced need for select backfill, which creates installation savings for customers and expands the range of possible product applications.
 Our SaniTite HP pipe utilizes the same polypropylene resins as our HP Storm pipe but includes a smooth third exterior wall in 30” to 60” pipe. The highly engineered polypropylene resin along with the triple wall design enables SaniTite HP to surpass the 46 pounds per square inch (“psi”), stiffness requirement for sanitary sewer applications. SaniTite HP offers cost and performance advantages relative to reinforced concrete pipe (such as improved hydraulics and better joint integrity) and PVC pipe (such as impact resistance).
 Single Wall Corrugated Pipe - Our single wall corrugated HDPE pipe is ideal for drainage projects where flexibility, light weight and low cost are important. Single wall HDPE pipe products have been used for decades in agricultural drainage, highway edge drains, septic systems and other construction applications. In the agricultural market, improved technology has highlighted the favorable impact of drainage on crop yields. For homeowners, it is an economical and easily installed solution for downspout run-off, foundation drains, driveway culverts and general lawn drainage. Single wall pipe is also used for golf courses, parks and athletic fields to keep surfaces dry by channeling away excess underground moisture.
 Standard single wall products are available in 2” to 24” diameters and sold in varying lengths. Pipe with 2” to 6” diameters is typically sold in coils ranging from 25’ to over 3,000’ in length, while larger diameter pipe is typically sold in 20’ lengths. Pipe can be either perforated or non-perforated depending on the particular drainage application.
 Triple Wall Corrugated Pipe and Smoothwall HDPE Pipe - Our ADS-3000 Triple Wall pipe, small diameter triple wall corrugated pipe, consists of a corrugated polyethylene core molded between a smooth white outer wall and a 
 6


Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
 
smooth black inner wall. This combination of the three wall design adds strength and stiffness, while reducing weight as compared to PVC 2729. Triple Wall is produced in two sizes, 3” and 4”, and sold through our distribution network. We also manufacture smoothwall HDPE pipe in 3”, 4”, and 6” diameters that are sold into the residential drainage and on-site septic systems markets.
Allied Products
 We produce a range of Allied Products that are complementary to our pipe products. Our Allied Products offer adjacent technologies to our core Pipe offering, presenting a complete drainage solution for our clients and customers. This combination of Pipe and Allied Products is a key strategy in our sales growth, profitability and market share penetration. The practice of selling a drainage system is attractive to both distributors and end users, by providing a broad package of products that can be sold on individual projects and strengthens our competitive advantage in the marketplace. We aggressively seek and evaluate new products, technologies and regulatory changes that impact our customers’ needs for Allied Products.
 Using the strength of our overall sales and distribution platform, our Allied Product strategy allows us to more deeply penetrate our end markets and anticipate the evolving needs of our customers. The underground construction industry has historically been project (not product) driven, creating the impetus for owners, engineers and contractors to seek manufacturers that deliver solution-based product portfolios. Many of the components of underground construction are related and require linear compatibility of function, regulatory approval and technology.
 Storm and Septic Chambers - Our StormTech chambers are used for stormwater retention, detention and “first flush” underground water storage on non-residential site development and public projects. These highly engineered chambers are injection molded from HDPE and PP resins into a proprietary design which provides strength, durability, and resistance to corrosion. The chambers allow for the efficient storage of stormwater volume, reducing the underground construction footprint and costs to the contractors, developers, and property owners. Our StormTech chambers offer great flexibility in design and layout of underground water storage systems. They are an attractive alternative to open ponds by reducing ongoing maintenance and liability and providing more useable land for development. Stormwater runoff is collected and stored in rows of chambers and gradually reenters the water system base, reducing erosion and protecting waterways. The chambers are open bottom, which allows for high density stacking in both storage and shipment. This freight-efficient feature drives favorable cost-competitiveness in serving long-distance export markets. These chamber systems typically incorporate our other product lines such as corrugated pipe, fabricated fittings, water quality units and geotextiles.
 Our ARC and BioDiffuser products are chambers that are used in septic systems for residential and small volume non-residential wastewater treatment and disposal. Rural homes and communities that do not have access to central sewer lines require an on-site septic solution. Our ARC and BioDiffuser chamber products are installed and perform their septic treatment function without gravel, reducing costs to the contractor and homeowner over traditional pipe and stone systems. States and municipalities have different sizing criteria for on-site septic treatment systems based on soil and site conditions. The innovative design of our ARC chamber is generally approved for a footprint reduction, further reducing the cost of the septic system. Injection-molded from HDPE, these products are strong, durable, and chemical-resistant. These interconnecting chambers are favored by septic contractors because they are lightweight, easy to install and offer articulating features which increase site-specific design flexibility.
 Structures - Our Nyloplast PVC drainage structures are used in non-residential, residential and municipal site development, road and highway construction, as well as landscaping, recreational, industrial and mechanical applications. The product family includes inline drains, drain basins, curb inlets and water control structures which move surface-collected stormwater vertically down to pipe conveyance systems. These custom structures are fabricated from sections of PVC pipe using a thermo-forming process to achieve exact site-specific hydraulic design requirements. Our Nyloplast products are a preferred alternative to heavier and larger concrete structures, by offering greater design flexibility and improved ease of installation which reduces overall project costs and timelines. The structures incorporate rubber gaskets to ensure watertight connections, preventing soil infiltration which plagues competitive products.

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
 
Our Inserta Tee product line consists of a PVC hub, rubber sleeve and stainless steel band. Inserta Tee is compression fit into the cored wall of a mainline pipe and can be used with all pipe material types and profiles. This product offers an easy tap-in to existing sanitary and storm sewers by limiting the excavation needed for installation compared to competitive products.
 Fittings - We produce fittings and couplings utilizing blow molding, injection molding and custom fabrication on our pipe products. Our innovative coupling and fitting products are highly complementary to our broader product suite, and include both soil-tight and water-tight capabilities across the full pipe diameter spectrum. Our fittings are sold in all end markets where we sell our current pipe products.
 Water Quality - Our BaySaver product line targets the removal of sediment, debris, oils and suspended solids throughout a stormwater rain event by separating and/or filtering unwanted pollutants. Our BaySeparators can be fabricated into multiple sizing combinations to fit a variety of applications and customer requirements. These products assist owners, developers and design engineers in remaining compliant with discharge requirements set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) as well as state and local regulatory agencies. Our BaySaver product line coupled with our pipe, StormTech chambers, fabricated fittings, Nyloplast structures, FleXstorm inlet protection systems and geotextiles make up a comprehensive stormwater management solution. Our Barracuda separator removes sediment and other debris from storm water run-off, further protecting water resources. The Barracuda separator is designed to be used in a single manhole configuration and offers multiple pipe configurations.
 Construction Fabrics & Geotextiles - We purchase and distribute construction fabrics and other geosynthetic products for soil stabilization, reinforcement, filtration, separation, erosion control, and sub-surface drainage. Constructed of woven and non-woven PP, geotextile products provide permanent, cost-efficient site-development solutions. Construction fabrics and geotextiles have applications in all of our end markets.
RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS
 Virgin HDPE and PP resins are derivatives of ethylene and propylene, respectively. Ethylene and propylene are derived from natural gas liquids or crude oil derivatives in the U.S. We currently purchase in excess of 825 million pounds of virgin and recycled resin annually from over 425 suppliers in North America. As a high-volume buyer of resin, we are able to achieve economies of scale to negotiate favorable terms and pricing. Our purchasing strategies differ based on the material (virgin resin versus recycled material) ordered for delivery to our production locations. The price movements of the different materials also vary, resulting in the need to use a number of strategies to reduce volatility and successfully pass on cost increases to our customer through timely selling price increases when needed.
 We have developed relationships with most of the North American producers of virgin high-density polyethylene and impact copolymer polypropylene producers that manufacture the grades we need to produce our products, including Braskem Americas, Inc., Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. LP, The Dow Chemical Company, Equistar Chemicals, LP, ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Formosa Plastics Corporation, U.S.A., Ineos Olefins & Polyolefins, USA, Sasol USA, and Nova Chemical. The North American capacity for ethylene derivatives has been expanded primarily as a result of the new supplies of natural gas liquids being produced through sustained oil and gas exploration and production.
 We leverage our raw material blending and processing technologies to produce an HDPE pipe that incorporates recycled resin. These products, which meet an ASTM International standard and an American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials standard, replaces a majority of the virgin resin that is used with optimized recycled materials. To further develop our recycled material strategies, we established Green Line Polymers, Inc. (“GLP”), as our wholly-owned recycling subsidiary in 2012. GLP procures and processes recycled raw materials that can be used in products we produce and sell. Our first production facilities were established in Ohio and Georgia and are focused on processing post-industrial HDPE recycled materials. Based on the success of this strategy, we acquired a business that could supply clean, post-consumer recycled HDPE to our upper Midwest plants and established a second post-consumer processing plant, in Pennsylvania, to support our plants in Ohio, Michigan and the eastern and southern U.S. In fiscal 2019, 91% of our non-virgin HDPE raw material needs were internally processed (enhanced) through our GLP operations.

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
 
We maintain relationships with several of the largest environmental companies such as Waste Management, Inc., Republic Services, Inc., and Rumpke, Inc., which provide us with post-consumer HDPE recycled materials. We also maintain relationships with several key post-industrial HDPE suppliers, including Performance Materials NA, Inc. (formerly E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company), Silgan Plastics, Consolidated Container Company and Alpla, Inc., which provide us with materials that cannot otherwise be utilized in their respective production processes.
 We are one of the largest domestic recyclers of HDPE. We believe that we are well positioned for future growth as we add additional recycled material processing facilities, add capacity to existing facilities, and expand our supplier base for virgin resin. We anticipate continued growth in the availability of ethylene and propylene which are used to manufacture HDPE and PP, respectively.
 CUSTOMERS
 We have a large, active customer base of approximately 20,000 customers, with two customers representing 10% or more of fiscal 2019 net sales. Ferguson Enterprises (“Ferguson”) accounted for 13.8% and Core and Main accounted for 11.6% of fiscal 2019 net sales. Our customer base is diversified across the range of end markets that we serve.
 A majority of our sales are made through distributors, including many of the largest national and independent waterworks distributors, with whom we have long-standing distribution relationships. These include Ferguson and Core and Main who sell primarily to the storm sewer and sanitary sewer markets. We also utilize a network of hundreds of small to medium-sized independent distributors across the United States. We have strong relationships with major national retailers that carry drainage products, including The Home Depot, Lowe’s, Ace Hardware and Do it Best. We offer the most complete line of HDPE products in the industry and are the only national manufacturer that can service the “Big-Box” retailers from coast-to-coast. We also sell to buying groups and co-ops in the United States that serve the plumbing, hardware, irrigation and landscaping markets. Selling to buying groups and co-ops provides us a further presence on a national, regional and local basis for the distribution of our products. Our preferred vendor status with these groups allows us to reach thousands of locations in an effective manner. Members of these groups and co-ops generally are independent businesses with strong relationships and brand recognition with smaller contractors and homeowners in their local markets. The combination of our large sales force, long-standing retail and contractor customer relationships and extensive network of manufacturing and distribution facilities complements and strengthens our broad customer and market coverage.
 Our customer service organization of more than 130 employees is supplemented by the employees of our manufacturing plants, distribution centers and drivers of our tractor-trailers. We staff and operate three regional customer service call centers. In conjunction with our field sales and engineering team, this highly trained and competent staff allows us to maintain more customer touch points and interaction than any of our competitors.
 SALES AND MARKETING
 We have one of the largest and most experienced sales and engineering forces in the industry, with more than 400 sales and engineering professionals. Offering the broadest product line in the industry enables our sales force to source the greatest number of new opportunities and more effectively cross-sell products than any of our competitors. We consistently maintain thousands of touch points with customers, civil engineers and municipal authorities, continuously educating them on new product innovations and their advantages relative to traditional products. We believe we are the industry leader in these efforts, and we view this work as an important part of our marketing strategy, particularly in promoting N-12 and SaniTite HP for storm and sanitary sewer systems, as regulatory approvals are essential to the specification and acceptance of these product lines.
 Our sales and marketing strategy is divided into four components — comprehensive market coverage, diverse product offerings, readily-available local inventory and specification efforts. Our goal is to provide the distributor/owner with the most complete, readily available product line in our industry. We strive to use our manufacturing footprint, product portfolio and market expertise to efficiently service our customers.
 Our sales and engineering objective is to influence, track and quote all selling opportunities as early in the project life cycle as possible. We strive to be meaningfully involved in all phases of the project cycle, including

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
 
design, bidding, award and installation. Conceptual project visibility allows sales and engineering professionals the ability to influence design specifications and increase the probability of inclusion of our products in bid documents. The inclusion of our products in bid documents improves the probability of completing the sale. On-demand installation support allows us to maintain customer relationships and ensure positive installation experience. In addition to direct channel customers, we also maintain and develop relationships with federal agencies, municipal agencies, national standard regulators, private consulting engineers and architects. Our consistent interaction with these market participants enables us to continue our market penetration. This ongoing dialogue has positioned us as an industry resource for design guidance and product development and as a respected expert in water management solutions.
SEASONALITY
 Historically, sales of our products have been higher in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions accelerating construction activity during these periods. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay projects.
 In the non-residential, residential and infrastructure markets in the northern United States and Canada, construction activity typically begins to increase in late March and is slower in December, January and February. In the southern and western United States, Mexico, Central America and South America, the construction markets are less seasonal. The agricultural drainage market is concentrated in the early spring just prior to planting and in the fall just after crops are harvested prior to freezing of the ground in winter.

 In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and use of our proprietary and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, distributors and others. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, or we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our ability to compete could be negatively impacted.”
 EMPLOYEES
 As of March 31, 2019, in our domestic and international operations the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 4,400 employees, consisting of approximately 3,000 hourly personnel and approximately 1,400 salaried employees. As of March 31, 2019, approximately 250 hourly personnel in our Mexican joint venture were covered by collective bargaining agreements.
REGULATION
 Our operations are affected by various statutes, regulations and laws in the markets in which we operate, which historically have not had a material effect on our business. We are subject to various laws applicable to businesses generally, including laws affecting land usage, zoning, the environment, health and safety, transportation, labor and employment practices, competition, immigration and other matters. Additionally, building codes may affect the products our customers are allowed to use, and, consequently, changes in building codes may affect the salability of our products. The transportation and disposal of many of our products are also subject to federal regulations. The U.S. Department of Transportation (“U.S. DOT”) regulates our operations in domestic interstate commerce. We are subject to safety requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the U.S. DOT. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also remain subject to both federal and state regulation.
 We have been able to consistently capitalize on changes in both local and federal regulatory statutes relating to storm and sanitary sewer construction, repair and replacement. Most noteworthy is the Federal Clean Water Act of 1972 and the subsequent EPA Phase I, II and sustainable infrastructure regulations relating to storm sewer construction, storm water quantity, storm water quality, and combined sewer separation. Our diversity of products offering a solution-based selling approach coupled with detailed market knowledge makes us an integral industry resource in both regulatory changes and compliance.
 An important element of our growth strategy has been our focus on industry education efforts to drive regulatory approvals for our core HDPE products at national, state and local levels. We employ a team of approximately 60 field-based engineers who work closely with government agencies to obtain regulatory approvals for our products, and also with civil engineering firms to specify our products on non-residential construction and road-building projects. With the introduction of our HP storm and sanitary pipe, we have refocused our efforts calling on state departments of transportation to enhance their approval of our pipe products. Additional state and local regulatory approvals will continue to present new growth opportunities in new and existing geographic markets for us. The trend of substituting traditional materials for HDPE and PP is expected to continue as more states and municipalities recognize the benefits of our HDPE N-12 pipe and our polypropylene HP pipe by approving it for use in a broader range of applications.
