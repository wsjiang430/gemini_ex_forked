Overview
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on August 22, 2016 as BioLabMart Inc. and changed our name to Qrons Inc. on August 8, 2017.
 
We are a preclinical stage biotechnology company developing advanced stem cell synthetic hydrogel-based solutions to combat neuronal injuries and achieve a breakthrough in the treatment of traumatic brain injuries ("TBIs") for both concussions and penetrating injuries, an unmet medical need. We believe that our approach is pushing the boundaries of science by using the latest advances in molecular biology and chemistry. The Company collaborates with universities and scientists in the fields of regenerative medicine, tissue engineering and 3D printable hydrogels to develop a treatment that integrates proprietary, engineered mesenchymal stem cells, 3D printable implant, smart materials and a novel delivery system.
 
To date, the Company has two products candidates for treating TBIs, both integrating proprietary, modified mesenchymal stem cells (“MSCs”) and smart synthetic material. QS100TM is an injury specific, 3D printable, implantable MSCs-synthetic hydrogel, to treat penetrating brain injuries and QS200TM is an injectable MSCs-synthetic hydrogel for the treatment of diffused injuries commonly referred to as concussions. 
 
As described below, while continuing research under the Company’s sponsored research agreement (the “Sponsored Research Agreement”) with the Trustees of Dartmouth College (“Dartmouth”) to develop innovative 3D printable, biocompatible advanced materials, the Company is currently engaged in discussions with Dartmouth to finalize terms of a worldwide, royalty bearing, exclusive license for such 3D printable materials in the field of human and animal health. In addition, the Company is engaged in laboratory research relating to neuronal tissue regeneration and/or repair in Israel in connection with service agreements with Ariel University R&D Co., Ltd., now known as Ariel Scientific Innovations Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Ariel University, in Ariel, Israel (“Ariel”).


Messrs. Meer and Merfeld, our Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively, as the holders of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of the Company's Class A Preferred Stock collectively have 66 2/3% of the voting rights of the Company. Acting together, they will be able to influence the outcome of all corporate actions requiring approval of our stockholders.
 
The Company's common stock was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") for quotation on the OTC pink sheets under the symbol "BLMB" as of July 3, 2017. On July 6, 2017, the Company's board of directors and shareholders approved an amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation changing the name of the Company from "BioLabMart Inc." to "Qrons Inc. The Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming approved the Company's Amendment to its Articles of Amendment reflecting the change of the Company's name from BioLabMart Inc. to Qrons Inc., effective August 8, 2017.  FINRA announced the Company's name change to Qrons Inc. on its Daily List on August 9, 2017. The new name and symbol change to "QRON" for the OTC market became effective on August 10, 2017.

Option Agreement with Dartmouth
 
On October 17, 2017, the Company entered into an option agreement (the "Option Agreement") with Dartmouth which provides for, among other things, the grant to the Company of a one-year exclusive option to negotiate a worldwide, royalty bearing, exclusive license with Dartmouth for 3D printable materials in the field of human and animal health. During the option period, the Company agreed to use all commercially reasonable resources to evaluate the intellectual property and provide quarterly milestone reports and a commercialization plan upon exercise of the option. Pursuant to the Option Agreement, the Company agreed to finance the prosecution of patents by Dartmouth to protect its intellectual property.  Further, the Agreement provides for the payment by the Company of an option fee and certain license fees and royalty payments based upon the Company's product sales, as part of a final negotiated license agreement. The Company exercised its option on March 26, 2018 to negotiate definitive license terms, as it continues further evaluation and research. The Company and Dartmouth are engaged in discussions to finalize terms of the license.
Sponsored Research Agreement with Dartmouth
 
On July 12, 2018, the Company entered into a one-year sponsored research agreement (the "Sponsored Research Agreement"), with Dartmouth pursuant to which the Company will fund research conducted by Dartmouth of mutual interest to the parties in accordance with the Agreement. Intellectual property invented or developed solely by a party shall be owned by such party and intellectual property jointly invented or developed shall be jointly owned. Dartmouth shall retain an irrevocable worldwide right to use intellectual property owned by it resulting from its research under the Sponsored Research Agreement on a non-exclusive royalty-free basis for research and education purposes.
 
If either party desires to obtain patent and copyright protection for intellectual property created under the Sponsored Research Agreement, such party shall notify the other party and the parties shall agree upon intellectual property protection strategy and cost allocation. Each party shall have the right to grant licenses under jointly-owned patents to third parties, subject to the Company's option to the exclusive right to license Dartmouth intellectual property and/or Dartmouth's ownership in jointly-owned intellectual property upon notification to Dartmouth in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and at the Company's cost. If the Company exercises its option to license intellectual property, Dartmouth shall negotiate exclusively with the Company for 180 days (or such additional period as agreed upon by the parties) for such licenses. The Company will be required to reimburse Dartmouth for the costs of patent prosecution and maintenance in the United States and any foreign country and demonstrate reasonable efforts to commercialize the technology.
 
The Sponsored Research Agreement may be terminated earlier than one year upon written agreement of the parties, a material breach which is not cured within 30 days of notice thereof, if Professor Ke no longer conducts the research under the Agreement and a successor acceptable to both parties is not available, or in the event of an unauthorized assignment of the Company's rights and obligations under the Agreement.
 
License Agreement with Ariel
 
On December 14, 2016, the Company entered into a license and research funding agreement (the "License Agreement") with Ariel under which the Company paid Ariel $100,000 to fund research for 12 months (with an option to extend such research financing and research period). In consideration therefor, the Company received an exclusive worldwide royalty-bearing license in Ariel patents and know-how to develop and commercialize products based on or incorporating coral-based conditioned medium for neuronal tissue regeneration and/or repair, resulting from Ariel's research or technology or the Company's research funding in accordance with milestones set forth in the Agreement.

The License Agreement provides that the Company make royalty payments of 4% of net sales (which may be increased if any patent is challenged by the Company or its affiliates or decreased if there is a valid patent claim) within 30 days of each calendar quarter for the later of (i) 15 years from the date of the first sale in a country and (ii) until the last to expire of Ariel's patents in a country. The Company may provide a sublicense for cash in a bonafide arm's length transaction. The Company agreed to pay Ariel 15% of any consideration received by the Company in connection with any such sublicense (except royalties on net sales) within 30 days of receipt. The Company is also required to make milestone payments of (i) $130,000 upon the successful completion of clinical U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") Phase II trials and (ii) $390,000 upon the successful completion of clinical FDA Phase III trials, within 6 months of completion. Any late payments under the License Agreement will bear interest at 3% plus LIBOR.
 
Patent expenses incurred by Ariel under the License Agreement will be reimbursed by the Company. Any infringement action instituted by a party to the License Agreement that results in a recovery in excess of such party's expenses will belong 85% to the party bringing such action and 15% to the other party.
 
Under the License Agreement, at the Company's discretion, Ariel will transfer its technology to the Company upon the earliest to occur of (i) a successful Phase II FDA trial of a product developed under the Agreement; (ii) the acquisition of the Company by a third party of at least 45% of the share capital of the Company in a bonafide transaction valued at least at $100 million and the assumption of the License Agreement by such third party, or (iii) Ariel's written consent.
 
The License Agreement provides that each of the Company and Ariel are required to keep the other party's proprietary information confidential for the longer of (i) the term of the License Agreement and seven years from the date of disclosure. The License Agreement shall continue in effect until all of the Company's payment obligations under the Agreement have been made. After the expiration of the License Agreement, the Company will have a non-exclusive worldwide license to the Ariel technology. The Company can terminate the License Agreement for any reason upon 60 days prior written notice in which event Ariel will be required to reimburse the Company for any unused research funds. The License Agreement will terminate upon a material breach of either party that is not cured in 30 days from notice thereof, or by bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or the discontinuance of business. Ariel may immediately terminate the License Agreement upon a challenge to its patent validity by the Company or an affiliate of the Company. Without Ariel's prior written consent, the Company may not assign the License Agreement except to an affiliate or to a successor entity in a merger or acquisition provided the assignee assumes the License Agreement obligations.
 
Upon the earliest occurrence of (i) an underwritten public offering with proceeds of at least $25 million, (ii) the consolidation, merger or reorganization, or (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of its shares or assets of the Company or its affiliates, the Company is required to issue to Ariel an immediately exercisable warrant for that number of shares equal to 4% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company at the time of issuance (the “Ariel Warrant”). The License Agreement also provides that the Company register shares exercised pursuant to the warrant by Ariel within 6 months of a request by Ariel by either "piggyback" or a demand registration.
 
The Company and Ariel entered into Addendum #1, effective December 13, 2017 (the "Addendum") to the License Agreement pursuant to which Ariel was permitted to exercise a portion of the Ariel Warrant On December 13, 2017, the Company issued 119,950 shares of common stock to Ariel, representing 1% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company on such date. The right to the balance of the shares subject to the Ariel Warrant remains subject to the terms of the License Agreement and the occurrence of an Exit Event (as described in the License Agreement). In addition, the Addendum provides that Ariel may not request a demand registration until the balance of the shares subject to the Ariel Warrant is exercised.
 
The issuance of shares upon exercise of the balance of the Ariel Warrant in the future will result in dilution to the interests of other stockholders.

Services Agreement with Ariel
 
In lieu of extending the research financing and research period under the License Agreement beyond the initial 12 months, on December 14, 2017, the Company entered into a 12-month services agreement with Ariel (the "Services Agreement") pursuant to which a team at Ariel University under the direction of Prof. Danny Baranes will conduct molecular biology research activities involving the testing of implant materials for the Company. If Prof. Baranes ceases to provide services, the Company must be notified and a replacement acceptable to the Company must be found within 30 days or the Company may terminate the Services Agreement. As compensation for such services, the Company paid Ariel (i) $17,250 on December 19, 2017 and (ii) $17,250 on April 26, 2018. On April 12, 2018, the Services Agreement was amended to provide for the payment by the Company of an additional monthly fee, commencing March 2018, of up to 8,000 Israeli shekels as compensation for additional costs which the Company may request.
 
The Services Agreement may be terminated by a non-breaching party upon a material breach that is not cured within 30 days by the other party. The Services Agreement may also be terminated by the Company upon thirty days' written notice to Ariel. Ariel must keep confidential information of the Company confidential for five years after the term of the Services Agreement.
 
On March 6, 2018, the Company entered into an additional service agreement with Ariel for the services of Professor Gadi Turgeman and his neurobiology research team in their lab pursuant to which the Company paid Ariel $20,580 on each of March 19, 2018 and August 22, 2018.
 
Business Description
 
Traumatic brain injury ("TBI") is a severe form of neuronal damage caused by powerful head impacts. Patients can experience transient symptoms, profound disability or death. TBI is generally caused by violent acts, motor vehicle accidents, falls and sports-related concussions.
 
TBI can be caused by penetrating injuries, in which an object pierces the skull and directly damages the brain, or non-penetrating blows that push the brain against the skull, inflicting neuronal damage, commonly referred to as concussions.
 Neuronal cells interconnect to create the gigantic network that drives core brain functions. Unfortunately, neurons rarely regenerate after an injury. As a result, following a severe brain injury, neural connectivity is lost and brain function compromised.
 
TBI patients can become blind, deaf, paralyzed and experience cognitive and psychological issues. There is also evidence that TBI patients may be more likely to develop Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases.
 
There are no effective treatments to help patients regain function of which we are aware. Current treatments focus on reducing secondary injuries. They can partially reduce further damage but do little or nothing to heal the brain. Most strategies are rehabilitative, helping patients adjust to their impaired cognitive state by creating workarounds, such as taking notes to compensate for lost short-term memory.
 
Our Mission and Product Candidates 
 
Our mission is to develop and license novel stem cell synthetic hydrogel-based solutions and systems to repair and regenerate neuronal damage. We are focused on finding a treatment for TBI. We believe that to repair TBIs, each injured site must receive a continuous flow of neuro-protective and neuro-regenerative agents in order to prevent further neuronal damage and have the potential to stimulate neurons to migrate to the injury site, regrow axonal processes and regenerate brain tissue.

Research by the Company is currently on course with internally established timelines. The Company has also been conducting research under the Sponsored Research Agreement with Professor Chenfeng Ke of the Chemistry Department at Dartmouth to develop innovative 3D printable, biocompatible advanced materials. The Company is working to produce and deliver a proprietary modified stem cell system that would be implanted at the target site and will induce neuronal recovery and/or slowdown of degenerative damage. 
 
To date, we have identified two product candidates, QS100TM for treating penetrating brain injuries and QS200TM, for treating concussions and other diffused axonal injuries. Both QS100TM and QS200TM integrate proprietary, modified mesenchymal stem cells and smart synthetic material. QS100TM uses an injury specific, 3D printable, implantable MSCs-synthetic compound to treat penetrating brain injuries (such as gunshot wounds, motor vehicle accidents and falls) and QS200TM uses an injectable MSCs-synthetic compound to treat diffused injuries commonly referred to as concussions.
 
QS100TM has demonstrated astrogliosis inhibition and induction of neuronal differentiation in an in-vivo animal experiments penetrating injury animal model. QS200TM research is near completion with further pre-clinical experiments scheduled to determine its efficacy for concussions and diffused brain injuries.
 
We believe that our latest advances provide a superior stem cells/synthetic hydrogel integration which will enable the unleashing of a precise, effective and controlled delivery of our proprietary MSCs.
 
While our research is progressing, there can be no assurance however that the research in which we are engaged will continue to progress or be successful in achieving its goals.
 
Our Market
 
Our market is the treatment of TBI. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (the "CDC"), TBI is a major cause of death and disability in the United States and TBI contributes to about 30% of all injury deaths According to the CDC, every day, 153 people in the United States die from injuries that include TBI. In 2013, about 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department ("ED") visits, hospitalizations, and deaths occurred in the United States. TBI contributed to the deaths of nearly 50,000 people. TBI was a diagnosis in more than 282,000 hospitalizations and 2.5 million ED visits.  These consisted of TBI alone or TBI in combination with other injuries. CDC data indicates that the economic cost of TBI in 2010, including direct and indirect medical costs, is estimated to be approximately $76.5 billion.
 
Market Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products, and any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that our novel multi- disciplinary approaches and scientific expertise will enable us to produce and deliver a treatment by integrating proprietary, engineered MSCs, synthetic hydrogels, 3D printable implants, smart materials and a novel delivery system to reduce neuronal loss and functional impairment and possibly regenerate brain tissue and function for TBI patients which will provide us with competitive advantages. We face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions that may develop potentially competitive products or technologies. To the extent that we develop product candidates for indications with larger patient populations, we expect to experience particularly intense competition from larger and better funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Any product candidate that we may develop will compete with such larger and better funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, established drugs or solutions and new drug candidates being developed by others, that may currently be in clinical trials.

Currently there are no approved products for our two product candidates. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we will strive to protect it, including by seeking, obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our product candidates, novel discoveries and technology, including new targets and applications, and other inventions that are important to our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company has an exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing license in Ariel patents and know-how for the development and commercialization of products based on or incorporating coral-based conditioned medium for neuronal tissue regeneration and/or repair, resulting from Ariel's research or technology or the Company's research funding. Under the License Agreement, Ariel will be responsible for the preparation, filing, prosecution and protection of the Ariel patents. Such preparation shall be done in consultation with the Company, provided expenses in excess of $1,000 will require Company pre-approval. The Company shall reimburse Ariel for all documented patent-related expenses.
 
On January 9, 2017, Ariel filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) a U.S. provisional patent application related to neural cell development research entitled “Methods, compositions and devices related to neural cell development”. Ariel refiled such provisional patent application on January 15, 2018 and January 17, 2019. A U.S. provisional patent application provides the means to establish an early effective filing date for a later filed nonprovisional patent application but does not mature into an issued patent unless the applicant files a regular non-provisional patent application within one year.
 
On April 9, 2018, the Company filed a provisional patent application with the USPTO entitled 'Techniques for Promoting Neuronal Recovery” and on January 22, 2019, filed a second application that included further technological developments and data.
 
The Company intends to file additional patents as research increases in order to protect its intellectual property.
 
On March 26, 2018, the Company exercised its exclusive option to negotiate a worldwide, royalty bearing, exclusive license with Dartmouth as it continues further evaluation and research for 3D printable materials in the field of human and animal health. During the option period, the Company agreed to use all commercially reasonable resources to evaluate the intellectual property and provide quarterly milestone reports and a commercialization plan upon exercise of the option. Pursuant to the Option Agreement, the Company agreed to finance the prosecution of patents by Dartmouth to protect its intellectual property.  Further, the Agreement provides for the payment by the Company of an option fee and certain license fees and royalty payments based upon the Company's product sales, as part of a final negotiated license agreement. The Company and Dartmouth are engaged in discussions to finalize terms of the license.

On November 15, 2017, Dartmouth filed a utility patent application with the USPTO for “Mechanically Interlocked Molecules-Based Materials” for 3-D printing, which the Company financed by reimbursing Dartmouth for the patent filing costs.
 
We cannot guarantee that our pending patent applications, or any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, will result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the scope of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not be able to maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates.
 
Government Regulation
 
The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing, and distribution of drug products, including biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States. We are not permitted to market any biological drug product in the United States until we receive a Biologics License from the FDA. We have not previously submitted a Biologics License Application ("BLA") to the FDA, or similar approval filings to comparable foreign authorities. A BLA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish that the product candidate is safe, pure, and potent for each desired indication. The BLA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls for the product, and the manufacturing facilities must complete a successful pre- license inspection. We expect the novel nature of our product candidates to create further challenges in obtaining regulatory approval. The FDA may also require a panel of experts, referred to as an Advisory Committee, to deliberate on the adequacy of the safety and efficacy data to support licensure. The opinion of the Advisory Committee, although not binding, may have a significant impact on our ability to obtain licensure of the product candidates based on the completed clinical trials. Accordingly, the regulatory approval pathway for our product candidates may be uncertain, complex, expensive, and lengthy, and approval may not be obtained.
 
We will also be required to comply with costly and time-consuming compliance by foreign regulatory authorities if we want to sell our products outside of the United States.
 
Ethical, social and legal concerns about research regarding stem cells, could result in regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 
FDA Review, Clearance and Approval Process
 
In the US, an investigational new drug application ("IND") is required for nearly all new drugs or biologics entering clinical trials. The IND comprises three sections: chemistry and manufacturing controls ("CMC"), clinical study design, and nonclinical studies. The nonclinical studies section mainly concerns safety and toxicity in animals using the clinically intended route of administration and a product very similar, if not identical, to that which will be used in the clinic. This section typically includes a description of efficacy studies in relevant disease models. The CMC section pertains to manufacturing processes and quality control systems for ensuring consistency and the absence of potentially deleterious agents in the final product. Each of the sections of the IND must provide reviewers with a sufficient amount of detail to determine the potential safety of any product before allowing evaluation in humans.

10
--

 

The regulatory route for licensure of an eventual product based on MSCs will likely require a BLA as opposed to a New Drug Application ("NDA"), the latter which generally pertains to drugs of well-defined composition. Within the FDA there are two centers responsible for oversight and approval of new drugs, The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ("CBER") and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research ("CDER"). Jurisdictional oversight of biologics generally falls to CBER: with important exceptions for less complex entities, such as monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins. Therefore, the complexity of MSCs whether wholly or partially fractioned, likely will place it under the review of CBER.
 
Clinical Trials
 
The first step, a preclinical phase, is to find a promising agent, which involves taking advantage of the advances made in understanding a disease, pharmacology, computer science, and chemistry. Breaking down a disease process into its components can provide clues for targeting drug development. For example, if an enzyme is determined to be a key component of a disease process, a researcher might seek ways to inhibit this enzyme. Advances in basic science might help by ascertaining the active enzyme site. Numerous compounds might be synthesized and tested before a promising agent emerges. Computer modeling often helps select what compounds might be the most promising.
 
The next step before attempting a clinical trial in humans is to test the drug in living animals, usually rodents. The FDA requires that certain animal tests be conducted before humans are exposed to a new molecular entity. The objectives of early in vivo testing are to demonstrate the safety of the proposed medication. For example, tests should prove that the compound does not cause chromosomal damage and is not toxic at the doses that would most likely be effective. The results of these tests are used to support the IND application that is filed with the FDA. The IND application includes chemical and manufacturing data, animal test results, including pharmacology and safety data, the rationale for testing a new compound in humans, strategies for protection of human volunteers, and a plan for clinical testing. If the FDA is satisfied with the documentation, the stage is set for phase 1 clinical trials.
 
Phase 1 studies focus on the safety and pharmacology of a compound. During this stage low doses of a compound are administered to a small group of healthy volunteers who are closely supervised. In cases of severe or life-threatening illnesses, volunteers with the disease may be used. Generally, 20 to 100 volunteers are enrolled in a phase 1 trial. These studies usually start with very low doses, which are gradually increased. On average, about two thirds of phase 1 compounds will be found safe enough to progress to phase 2.
 
Phase 2 studies examine the effectiveness of a compound. To avoid unnecessarily exposing a human volunteer to a potentially harmful substance, studies are based on an analysis of the fewest volunteers needed to provide sufficient statistical power to determine efficacy. Typically, phase 2 studies involve 100 to 300 patients who suffer from the condition the new drug is intended to treat. During phase 2 studies, researchers seek to determine the effective dose, the method of delivery (e.g., oral or intravenous), and the dosing interval, as well as to reconfirm product safety. Patients in this stage are monitored carefully and assessed continuously. A substantial number of these drug trials are discontinued during phase 2 studies. Some drugs turn out to be ineffective, while others have safety problems or intolerable side effects.

Phase 3 trials are the final step before seeking FDA approval. During phase 3, researchers try to confirm previous findings in a larger population. These studies usually last from 2 to 10 years and involve thousands of patients across multiple sites. These studies are used to demonstrate further safety and effectiveness and to determine the best dosage. Despite the intense scrutiny, a product receives before undergoing expensive and extensive phase 3 testing, approximately 10% of medications fail in phase 3 trials.
 
If a drug or biologic survives the clinical trials, an NDA or BLA is submitted to the FDA. An NDA or BLA contains all the preclinical and clinical information obtained during the testing phase. The application contains information on the chemical makeup and manufacturing process, pharmacology and toxicity of the compound, human pharmacokinetics, results of the clinical trials, and proposed labeling. An NDA can include experience with the product from outside the United States as well as external studies related to the drug.
 
After receiving an NDA or BLA, the FDA completes an independent review and makes its recommendations. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (“PDUFA”) was designed to help shorten the review time. This act allowed the agency to collect user fees from pharmaceutical companies as financial support to enhance the review process. The 1992 act specifies that the FDA reviews a standard drug or biologic application within 12 months and a priority application within 6 months. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process may be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Application for drugs or biologics similar to those on the market are considered standard, whereas priority applications represent drugs or biologics offering important advances in addition to existing treatments. If during the review the FDA staff feels there is a need for additional information or corrections, they will make a written request to the applicant. During the review process it is not unusual for the FDA to interact with the applicant staff.
 
Once the review is complete, the NDA or BLA might be approved or rejected. If the drug or biologic is not approved, the applicant is given the reasons why and what information could be provided to make the application acceptable. Sometimes the FDA makes a tentative approval recommendation, requesting that a minor deficiency or labeling issue be corrected before final approval. Once a drug or biologic is approved, it can be marketed.
 
Some approvals contain conditions that must be met after initial marketing, such as conducting additional clinical studies. For example, the FDA might request a post-marketing, or phase 4, study to examine the risks and benefits of the new drug or biologic in a different population or to conduct special monitoring in a high-risk population. Alternatively, a phase 4 study might be initiated by the sponsor to assess such issues as the longer-term effects of exposure, to optimize the dose for marketing, to evaluate the effects in pediatric patients, or to examine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for additional indications. Post-marketing surveillance is important, because even the most well-designed phase 3 studies might not uncover every problem that could become apparent once a product is widely used. Furthermore, the new product might be more widely used by groups that might not have been well studied in the clinical trials, such as elderly patients. A crucial element in this process is that physicians report any untoward complications. The FDA has set up a medical reporting program called Medwatch to track serious adverse events. The manufacturer must report adverse reactions at quarterly intervals for the first 3 years after approval including a special report for any serious and unexpected adverse reactions.
 
Employees
 
As of March 22, 2019, we had three full-time employees and two part-time employees. In addition, our two executive officers, Jonah Meer and Ido Merfeld, who are our sole officers and directors, are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our company. We currently outsource all professional services to third parties in an effort to maintain lower operational costs.
Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred research and development costs of $919,706 and $1,179,777, respectively.
