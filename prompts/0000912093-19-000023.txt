(“VIAVI,” also referred to as “the Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”), is a global provider of network test, monitoring and assurance solutions to communications service providers, enterprises, network equipment manufacturers, civil government, military and avionics customers, supported by a worldwide channel community including VIAVI Velocity Partners. Our Velocity program (“Velocity”) allows us to optimize the use of direct or partner sales depending on application and sales volume. Velocity expands our reach into new market segments as well as expands our capability to sell and deliver solutions. We deliver end-to-end visibility across physical, virtual and hybrid networks, enabling customers to optimize connectivity, quality of experience and profitability. We are also a leader in high performance thin film optical coatings, providing light management solutions to anti-counterfeiting, 3D sensing, electronics, automotive, defense and instrumentation markets.
To serve our markets, during fiscal 2019 we operated in the following business segments:

• | Network Enablement (“NE”);


• | Service Enablement (“SE”); and


• | Optical Security and Performance Products (“OSP”)

Industry Trends
NE and SE
NE and SE are collectively referred to as Network and Service Enablement (“NSE”)
The telecommunications (“Telecom”) and cable industries are experiencing a major evolution in technology that is likely to last for the next decade as wireless communications shift from 4G to 5G technology and its promise of greater bandwidth capacity, faster transmission speeds and lower latency response time. 5G is a disruptive technology that is expected to be deployed by late calendar 2019 using millimeter wave and sub-6 Ghz technologies versus the current and legacy radio wave technology that has been in place for more than 30 years beginning with 1G wireless technology. 
Wireless communications connectivity at the edge, or the “last mile” or “last hundred yards”, will bring gigahertz speeds and capacity to the home as well as to “all devices” and to “all connected cars”. The 5G transition is expected to be deployed globally and is expected to be disruptive to businesses, consumers and potentially create new applications and new industries. The adoption of 5G also requires increased bandwidth and speed backhaul capability from the network edge to the network core. This requires optical fiber upgrade or buildout as legacy copper line networks are decommissioned. 100GbE optical fiber is being deployed in many metropolitan networks, with the leading-edge networks installing 400GbE optical fiber. In the labs, 800GbE fiber technology is being evaluated for the future next generation optical network. These investments will extend fiber connectivity beyond the office and home and permeate “fiber-to-the-everywhere” (“FTTX”).
While new networks are expected to deploy 5G wireless and advanced optical fiber technology, existing network infrastructure that is not otherwise being upgraded is still expected to be modernized with new cable and access technologies. Cable service providers are investing in DOCSIS 3.1 to enhance existing cable networks with higher speed connectivity and bandwidth capacity. Some telecom operators with legacy copper digital subscriber line (“DSL”) have chosen to extend the useful life of these legacy networks by upgrading to Gfast technology. Many operators, however, have decided to run these networks until no longer operable and then replace them with new fiber.
5G Wireless has broader applications beyond smart mobile devices. 5G’s increased bandwidth capacity and speed, as well as lower latency, this should enable numerous devices, referred to as the “Internet of Things” (“IOT”), to have greater device-to-device connectivity to enable smart homes, smart cities, smart and autonomous cars and other applications that are yet to be conceptualized.
The convergence of network technologies requires significant investments from both the traditional carriers (telecom and cable) and cloud service providers. To achieve scale and a profitable return on investment, these communications service providers (“CSPs”) in recent years have consolidated and are expected to continue to consolidate. While traditional service provider capital spending in physical networks has been declining, and this impacts the served available market opportunity for our NSE segment. However, the new cloud service providers and virtualized networks create new NSE opportunities. Our NE and SE products and 
solutions are well positioned to meet these rapidly changing industry trends, given our technology and products, as well as customer installed base.
NE’s AvComm (or Avionics Communications) products from our acquisition of that business from Cobham plc in March 2018, further expand NSE’s Test & Measurement (T&M) opportunity into the government, civil, aerospace and military markets for communications and public safety testing. Military radio test and avionics products are a growth opportunity as defense and public safety department budgets increase significantly due to the ongoing upgrade from analog to digital communications. The Aerospace market continues to remain robust with increased commercial airline passenger traffic expected to drive demand for aircraft and aircraft testing instruments.
OSP
Counterfeiting of banknotes and other goods is rising as counterfeiters now have increasing access to a broad range of advanced but relatively low-cost imaging technologies and printing tools. This gives them the ability to create convincing simulations of actual documents and products for illicit purposes. At the same time, both the availability of investigative resources and the penalties for counterfeiting can often be relatively modest when compared to other crimes. We have decades of anti-counterfeiting expertise leveraging our Optically Variable Pigment (“OVP®”), and our Optically Variable Magnetic Pigment (“OVMP®”) technologies to protect the integrity of banknotes and other high-value documents by delivering optical effects that, on one hand, consumers can easily recognize but on the other hand, counterfeiters find very difficult to reproduce. We also provide optical technologies for government, healthcare, consumer electronics and industrial markets.
In addition to Anti-Counterfeiting solutions, we extend our optical technology expertise to solve complex problems and deliver unique solutions in other industries. For example, we manufacture and sell optical filters for 3D sensing products that separate out ambient light from incoming data to allow devices to be controlled by a person’s movements or gestures. Our proprietary low angle shift technology enables our customers to significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of their systems and deliver truly compelling system performance. Through multiple generations of increasing performance and decreasing cost, we believe we remain the industry’s leading supplier of high-performance filters for depth-sensing systems in consumer electronics. In October 2018, we acquired RPC Photonics (“RPC”), a technology leader in engineered optical diffusers which broadens the 3D Sensing product portfolio. Engineered DiffusersTM are incorporated in 3D Sensing applications within a smartphone which diffuses the transmitted infrared laser light for critical eye safety. This enables the safely transmitted infrared light to impinge on the target, i.e. human facial profile, where the light is then reflected back to the 3D Sensor on the smartphone and an image process gathers the target information for facial recognition authentication.
Sales and Marketing
CSPs make up the majority of NE and SE revenues. We also market and sell products to network equipment manufacturers (“NEMs”), original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), enterprises, governmental organizations, distributors and strategic partners worldwide. We have a dedicated sales force organized around the markets a given segment serves that works directly with customers’ executive, technical, manufacturing and purchasing personnel to determine design, performance, and cost requirements. We are also supported by a worldwide channel community, including our Velocity Solution Partners who support our NE and SE segments.
A high level of support is a critical part of our strategy to develop and maintain long-term collaborative relationships with our customers. We develop innovative products by engaging our customers at the initial design phase and continues to build that relationship as our customers’ needs change and develop. Service and support are provided through our offices and those of our partners worldwide.
Corporate Information
The Company was incorporated in California in 1979 as Uniphase Corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in 1993. Our heritage includes several significant mergers and acquisitions including, among others, the combination of Uniphase Corporation and JDS FITEL in 1999. In 2000 we acquired Optical Coatings Lab, Inc., which is currently part of our OSP business segment, and in 2005 we acquired Acterna, Inc. which is currently part of our NSE business segment(s). Following these acquisitions, we operated as a company comprised of a portfolio of businesses with a focus on optical innovation, communications network and service enablement, commercial lasers and anti-counterfeiting solutions.

Trends
Counterfeiting of banknotes and other goods has risen as counterfeiters have increased access to a broad range of advanced but relatively low-cost imaging technologies and printing tools, giving them the ability to create convincing simulations of actual documents and products for illicit purposes. At the same time, the available investigative resources and the penalties for counterfeiting can often be relatively modest when compared to other crimes. As a result, demand is increasing for sophisticated overt anti-counterfeiting features, such as our OVP® and OVMP® technologies, which consumers can easily validate without the use of special tools but are difficult to create or simulate using conventional printing technology.
The aerospace, defense, consumer electronics and medical/environmental instrumentation markets require customized, high-precision coated products and optical components that selectively absorb, transmit or reflect light to meet the performance requirements of sophisticated systems. Our custom optics products offer an array of advanced technologies and precision optics-from the UV to the far IR portion of the light spectrum to meet the specific requirements of our customers.
3D sensing is an emerging technology, where OSP’s optical filters and Engineered DiffusersTM plan to be deployed in smartphones for facial recognition biometric authentication. 3D sensing optical filters separate out ambient light from incoming data to allow devices to be controlled by a person’s movements, gestures or features. Other potential technology markets for OSP’s optical filters include augmented/virtual reality, sensors deployed in autonomous vehicles and Internet of Things (IoT). Engineered DiffusersTM optimize transmitted infrared laser light in a 3D sensing module to ensure visual eye safety. The diffuser redirects the laser light to avoid direct eye contact, a critical safety feature for 3D sensing applications.

Although we intend to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. We may not be able to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, or at all; therefore, the loss or interruption of such arrangements could impact our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
Intellectual property rights apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We do not intend to broadly license our intellectual property rights unless we can obtain adequate consideration or enter into acceptable patent cross-license agreements. As of June 29, 2019, we owned approximately 793 U.S. patents and 1,295 foreign patents and have 767 patent applications pending throughout the world.
Backlog
We consider our backlog balance to be an estimate of future revenue to be earned from contractually committed product and service arrangements. As of June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, our backlog was approximately $244.1 million and $221.9 million, respectively.
Due to possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders, and because our sales often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period.
Employees
We employed approximately 3,600 employees as of June 29, 2019, which included approximately 1,200 employees in manufacturing, 1,000 employees in research and development, 850 employees in sales and marketing, and 550 employees in 
general and administration. This compared to a workforce of approximately 3,500 as of June 30, 2018, and 2,700 as of July 1, 2017.
Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. We recognize stock-based compensation cost over the award’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis.
Similar to other technology companies, we rely upon our ability to use “Full Value Awards” (as defined below) and other forms of stock-based compensation as key components of our executive and employee compensation structure. Full Value Awards refer to restricted stock units (“RSUs”), market-based RSUs (“MSUs”) and performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) that are granted without an exercise or purchase price and are converted to shares immediately upon vesting. The MSUs have vesting requirements tied to the performance of our stock as compared to the Nasdaq telecommunications index, and could vest at a higher or lower rate or not at all, based on this relative performance. The PSUs have vesting requirements tied to our performance. Historically, these components have been critical to our ability to retain important personnel and offer competitive compensation packages. Without these components, we would be required to significantly increase cash compensation levels or develop alternative compensation structures to retain our key employees.
Outside of the United States, our businesses are subject to labor laws that differ from those in the United States. We follow statutory requirements, and in certain European countries it is common for a works council, consisting of elected employees, to represent the sites when discussing matters such as compensation, benefits or terminations of employment. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal, as is typical for our competitors and many large companies. For NSE, revenue is typically higher in the second and fourth fiscal quarter, all else being equal. There is typically a modest end of calendar year customer spending budget flush that benefits the December quarter. Telecom and cable spending budgets are typically set at the start of a new calendar year, the March quarter and thus NSE’s weakest revenue quarter, all else being equal, with spending release and benefiting the June quarter. For our OSP business, given our recent exposure to the consumer market, namely our 3D Sensing products into the smart phone market, OSP revenue is expected to be seasonally higher in the first and second fiscal quarter followed by seasonal demand declines in the third and fourth fiscal quarters.
