ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate Overview
MVB Financial Corp. (“the Company”) is a financial holding company and was organized in 2003. MVB operates principally through its wholly-owned subsidiary, MVB Bank, Inc. (“MVB Bank”). MVB Bank’s operating subsidiaries include MVB Mortgage, MVB Insurance, LLC (“MVB Insurance”), and MVB Community Development Corporation (“CDC”).
MVB Bank was chartered in 1997 and commenced operations in 1999. 
In 2012, MVB Bank acquired Potomac Mortgage Group, Inc. (“PMG” which began doing business under the registered trade name “MVB Mortgage”), a mortgage company in the northern Virginia area, and fifty percent (50%) interest in a mortgage services company, Lender Service Provider, LLC (“LSP”). In 2013, this fifty percent interest (50%) in LSP was reduced to a twenty-five percent (25%) interest and in 2017, a forfeiture of a partial interest occurred, which increased the interest owned to thirty-three percent (33%). At this time, LSP began doing business as Lenderworks. 
MVB Insurance was originally formed in 2000. In 2013, MVB Insurance became a direct subsidiary of the Company. In 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with USI Insurance Services (“USI”), in which USI purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of MVB Insurance, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $6.9 million and was reported in discontinued operations. MVB Insurance retained the assets related to, and continues to operate, its title insurance business, which is immaterial in terms of revenue. The Company reorganized MVB Insurance as a subsidiary of the Bank in 2016.
MVB CDC was formed in 2017 and was created as a means to provide opportunities for loans and investments that help to increase access to equity capital in under-served urban and rural areas of West Virginia and our market areas in Virginia. MVB CDC promotes specific bank-driven economic development strategies, provides for effective support for its CRA compliance strategy, and helps to support positive local reputation of the Bank through marketing and visible activities in the communities where we live and work.
Business Overview
The Company’s primary business activities, through its subsidiaries, are primarily community banking and mortgage banking. The Bank offers its customers a full range of products and services including:

• | Various demand deposit accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit;


• | Commercial, consumer, and real estate mortgage loans and lines of credit;


• | Debit cards;


• | Cashier’s checks;


• | Safe deposit rental facilities; and


• | Non-deposit investment services.

The Company is also involved in new innovative strategies to provide independent banking to corporate clients throughout the United States by leveraging recent investments in Fintech.
The Bank’s financial products and services are offered through its financial service locations and automated teller machines (“ATMs”) in West Virginia and Virginia, as well as telephone and internet-based banking through both personal computers and mobile devices. Non-deposit investment services are offered through an association with a broker-dealer. 
Since its opening in 1999, the Bank has experienced significant growth in assets, loans, and deposits due to strong community and customer support in Marion and Harrison counties in West Virginia, expansion into Jefferson, Berkeley, Monongalia, and Kanawha counties in West Virginia and, most recently, into Fairfax and Loudoun counties in Virginia. Since the acquisition of PMG, mortgage banking is now a much more significant focus, which has opened increased market opportunities in the Washington, DC metropolitan region and added enough volume to further diversify the Company’s revenue stream.
The Company’s business activities include three reportable segments: commercial and retail banking, mortgage banking, and a financial holding company. For a discussion of each of these reporting segments, please see Note 21, “Segment Reporting” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Primary Market Area and Customers
The Company considers its primary market area to be comprised of those counties where it has a physical branch presence and their contiguous counties. This includes Marion, Harrison, Jefferson, Berkeley, Monongalia, and Kanawha counties of West Virginia and Fairfax and Loudoun counties of Virginia. The Bank currently operates a total of fifteen full-service banking branches: twelve in West Virginia and three in Virginia. MVB Mortgage operates eleven mortgage-only offices, located in Virginia, within the Washington, DC metropolitan area, Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina. In addition, MVB Mortgage has mortgage loan originators located at select Bank locations throughout West Virginia. 
The Company originates various types of loans, including commercial and commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, home equity lines of credit, real estate construction loans, and consumer loans (loans to individuals). In general, the Company retains most of its originated loans (exclusive of long-term, fixed rate residential mortgages that are sold). However, loans originated in excess of the Bank’s legal lending limit are participated to other banking institutions and the servicing of those loans is retained by the Bank.
The current economic climate in the Company’s primary market areas reflect economic climates that are consistent with the general national climate. Unemployment in the United States was 3.7%, 3.9% and 4.5% in December 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The unemployment levels in the Company’s primary market areas were as follows for the periods indicated:

 | December 2018 | | December 2017 | | December 2016
Berkeley County, WV | 3.5 | % | | 3.6 | % | 3.0 | %
Harrison County, WV | 4.3 | % | | 4.6 | % | 4.9 | %
Jefferson County, WV | 3.0 | % | | 3.0 | % | 2.6 | %
Marion County, WV | 4.9 | % | | 5.4 | % | 5.1 | %
Monongalia County, WV | 3.7 | % | | 3.5 | % | 3.3 | %
Kanawha County, WV | 4.5 | % | | 5.1 | % | 4.7 | %
Fairfax County, VA | 2.1 | % | | 2.6 | % | 3.0 | %
Loudoun County, VA | 2.1 | % | | 2.7 | % | 3.0 | %

Segment Reporting
The Company has identified three reportable segments: commercial and retail banking; mortgage banking; and financial holding company. Insurance services was previously identified as a reportable segment until entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement with USI, as discussed above and in Note 22, “Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue from commercial and retail banking activities consists primarily of interest earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Revenue from financial holding company activities is mainly comprised of intercompany service income and dividends.
Revenue from the mortgage banking activities is comprised of interest earned on loans and fees received as a result of the mortgage origination process. The mortgage banking services are conducted by MVB Mortgage. Revenue from insurance services is comprised mainly of commissions on the sale of insurance products. None of the insurance services activity is included in continuing operations due to the sale, as discussed below and in Note 22, “Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
For more information about each of the Company’s reportable segments, please refer to Note 21, “Segment Reporting” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Commercial Loans
At December 31, 2018, the Bank had outstanding approximately $941.0 million in commercial loans, including commercial, commercial real estate, financial and agricultural loans. These loans represented approximately 72.2% of the total aggregate loan portfolio as of that date.
4

Lending Practices. Commercial lending entails significant additional risks as compared with consumer lending (i.e., single-family residential mortgage lending, and installment lending). In addition, the payment experience on commercial loans typically depends on adequate cash flow of a business and thus may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the general economy or in a specific industry. Loan terms include amortization schedules commensurate with the purpose of each loan, the source of repayment and the risk involved. The primary analysis technique used in determining whether to grant a commercial loan is the review of a schedule of estimated cash flows to evaluate whether anticipated future cash flows will be adequate to service both interest and principal due. In addition, the Bank reviews collateral to determine its value in relation to the loan in the event of a foreclosure.
The Bank evaluates all new commercial loans and the Credit Department facilitates an annual loan review process that ensures that a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio, typically a minimum of 50%, is reviewed each year under a risk-based approach. If deterioration in credit worthiness has occurred, the Bank takes prompt action designed to assure repayment of the loan. Upon detection of the reduced ability of a borrower to meet original cash flow obligations, the loan is considered a classified loan and reviewed for possible downgrading or placement on non-accrual status.
Consumer Loans
At December 31, 2018, the Bank had outstanding consumer loans in an aggregate amount of approximately $9.6 million or approximately 0.7% of the aggregate total loan portfolio.
Lending Practices: Consumer loans generally involve more risk as to collectability than mortgage loans because of the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain instances, the absence of collateral. As a result, consumer lending collections are dependent upon the borrower’s continued financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by employment loss, personal bankruptcy, or adverse economic conditions. Credit approval for consumer loans requires demonstration of sufficiency of income to repay principal and interest due, stability of employment, a positive credit record and sufficient collateral for secured loans. It is the policy of the Bank to review its consumer loan portfolio monthly and to charge-off loans that do not meet its standards and to adhere strictly to all laws and regulations governing consumer lending.
Real Estate Loans
At December 31, 2018, the Bank had approximately $353.9 million of residential real estate loans, home equity lines of credit, and construction mortgages outstanding, representing 27.1% of total loans outstanding.
Lending Practices: The Bank generally requires that the residential real estate loan amount be no more than 80% of the purchase price or the appraised value of the real estate securing the loan, unless the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance for the percentage exceeding 80%. Occasionally, the Bank may lend up to 100% of the appraised value of the real estate. Loans made in this lending category are generally one to ten-year adjustable rate, fully amortizing to maturity mortgages. MVB Bank also originates fixed rate real estate loans and generally sells these loans in the secondary market. Most real estate loans are secured by first mortgages with evidence of title in favor of the Bank in the form of an attorney’s opinion of the title or a title insurance policy. MVB Bank also requires proof of hazard insurance with the Bank named as the mortgagee and as the loss payee. Full appraisals are obtained from licensed appraisers for the majority of loans secured by real estate.
Home Equity Loans: Home equity lines of credit are generally made as second mortgages by MVB Bank. The maximum amount of a home equity line of credit is generally limited to 80% of the appraised value of the property less the balance of the first mortgage. The Bank will lend up to 89.9% of the appraised value of the property at higher interest rates which are considered compatible with the additional risk assumed in these types of loans. The home equity lines of credit are written with 10 year terms, but are subject to review upon request for renewal.
Construction Loans: Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, MVB may advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. Also, note that with respect to construction loans, the Bank generally makes loans to the homeowner and not to builders. At December 31, 2018, residential mortgage construction loans to individuals totaled approximately $93.2 million with an average life of 8 months and are generally refinanced to a permanent loan upon completion of the construction.

Competition
The Company experiences significant competition in attracting depositors and borrowers. Competition in lending activities comes principally from other commercial banks, savings associations, insurance companies, governmental agencies, credit unions, brokerage firms and pension funds. The primary factors in competing for loans are interest rate and overall lending services. Competition for deposits comes from other commercial banks, savings associations, money market funds and credit unions as well as from insurance companies and brokerage firms. The primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates paid on deposits, account liquidity, convenience of office location and overall financial condition. The Company believes that its community approach provides flexibility, which enables the Bank to offer an array of banking products and services. MVB Mortgage faces significant competition from both traditional financial institutions and other national and local mortgage banking operations.
The Company primarily focuses on the Marion, Harrison, Jefferson, Berkeley, Monongalia and Kanawha County markets in West Virginia and the northern Virginia area for its products and services. Management believes it has developed a level of expertise in serving this area.
The Company operates under a “needs-based” selling approach that management believes has proven successful in serving the financial needs of most customers. It is not the Company’s strategy to compete solely on the basis of interest rates. Management believes that a focus on customer relationships and service will promote our customers’ continued use of our financial products and services and will lead to enhanced revenue opportunities.
Supervision and Regulation
The Company, the Bank and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. The Company’s earnings are affected by general economic conditions, management policies, changes in state and federal laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities, including those referred to in this section. The following discussion describes elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies, financial holding companies, and banks and contains specific information about the Company. Regulation of banks, bank holding companies, and financial holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the stability of the financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors.
In addition to banking laws, regulations and regulatory agencies, the Company is subject to various other laws, regulations, supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect the operations and management of the Company and its ability to make distributions to shareholders. State and federal law govern the activities in which the Bank engages, the investments it makes, and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect the Company’s operations.
The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. Such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes may have on the Company is impossible to determine with any certainty. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company and its subsidiary could have a material effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations.
Financial Regulatory Reform
During the past several years, there has been a significant increase in regulation and regulatory oversight for U.S. financial services firms, primarily resulting from the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act is extensive, complicated, and comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization, representing a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes that affect financial companies, including banks, bank holding companies, and financial holding companies such as the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes new prudential regulation on depository institutions and their holding companies. As such, the Company is subject to more stringent standards and requirements with respect to (1) bank and nonbank acquisitions and mergers, (2) the “financial activities” in which it engages as a financial holding company, (3) affiliate transactions and (4) proprietary trading, among other provisions. 
On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “EGRRCPA”) was enacted, which repeals or modifies certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and eases regulations on all but the largest banks. These modifications include, among other changes: (i) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the ability-to-repay requirements for certain qualified residential mortgage loans held in portfolio; (ii) not require appraisals for certain transactions 
6

valued at less than $400,000 in rural areas; (iii) exempt banks that originate fewer than 500 open-end and 500 closed-end mortgages from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act’s expanded data disclosures; (iv) clarify that, subject to various conditions, reciprocal deposits of another depository institution obtained using a deposit broker through a deposit placement network for purposes of obtaining maximum deposit insurance would not be considered brokered deposits subject to the FDIC’s brokered-deposit regulations; (v) raise eligibility for the 18-month exam cycle from $1 billion to banks with $3 billion in assets; and (vi) simplify capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that upon the election of a bank would replace the risk-based capital requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board was required to raise the asset threshold under its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion for bank holding companies that are exempt from consolidated capital requirements, provided that such companies meet certain other conditions such as not engaging in significant nonbanking activities. 
Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other laws, such as the EGRRCPA, are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed and/or adopted that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions operating and doing business in the United States. Changes in leadership at various federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve, can also change the policy direction of these agencies. Certain of these recent proposals and changes are described below. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of any new regulations so promulgated, including changes in regulatory costs and fees, modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions, among others.
Regulatory Agencies
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. As a financial holding company and a bank holding company, the Company is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and it and its subsidiary are subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”). The BHCA provides generally for “umbrella” regulation of financial holding companies such as the Company by the Federal Reserve Board, and for functional regulation of banking activities by bank regulators, securities activities by securities regulators, and insurance activities by insurance regulators. The Company is also under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as administered by the SEC.
The Bank is a West Virginia state chartered bank. The Bank is not a member bank of the Federal Reserve System (“non-member bank”). Accordingly, the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions and the FDIC are the primary regulators of the Bank.
Bank Holding Company Activities
In general, the BHCA limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve Board in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve Board), without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. Under current federal law, as a bank holding company, the Company has elected to become a financial holding company.
Most of the financial activities that are permissible for financial holding companies also are permissible for a bank’s “financial subsidiary,” except for insurance underwriting, insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investments and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted by a financial holding company. In order for a financial subsidiary of a bank to engage in permissible financial activities, federal law requires, among other conditions, that the parent bank be well managed and have at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating, and the parent bank and all of its bank affiliates must be well capitalized.
To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable Federal Reserve Board regulations and the depository institution subsidiaries controlled by the company must have at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating. A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be “well capitalized” if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the sections captioned “Capital 
7

Requirements” and “Prompt Corrective Action,” included elsewhere in this item. A depository institution subsidiary is considered “well managed” if it received a composite rating of 1 or 2 and management rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, the Federal Reserve Board’s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Board to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the Federal Reserve Board may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve Board may require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions. Under the Riegle-Neal lnterstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, banks must be both well capitalized and well managed to merger with a bank with a different home state. If a depository institution receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the Community Reinvestment Act, the financial holding company may not commence any additional financial activity or acquire a company engaged in financial activity, until the bank subsidiary has achieved at least a rating of satisfactory under the Community Reinvestment Act.
In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHCA or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHCA, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act. See the section captioned “Community Reinvestment Act” included elsewhere in this item.
The Federal Reserve Board has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve Board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
 As required by the EGRRCPA, in August 2018, the Federal Reserve Board issued an interim final rule that expanded applicability of the Federal Reserve Board’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. The interim final rule raised the policy statement’s asset threshold from $1 billion to $3 billion in total consolidated assets for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that: (1) is not engaged in significant nonbanking activities; (2) does not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities; and (3) does not have a material amount of debt or equity securities, other than trust-preferred securities, outstanding that are registered with the SEC. The interim final rule provides that, if warranted for supervisory purposes, the Federal Reserve Board may exclude a company from the threshold increase. Management believes the Company meets the conditions of the Federal Reserve Board’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement and is therefore excluded from consolidated capital requirements and is subject to specific debt to equity ratio requirements. To be considered well capitalized, a company subject to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement must meet certain requirements, including having a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0:1 or less. Further, qualification as a small bank holding company allows the Company to file more abbreviated, and less frequent, consolidated and holding company reports with the Federal Reserve. The Bank remains subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.
Federal Securities Regulation
The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), which imposes numerous reporting, accounting, corporate governance and business practices on companies, as well as financial and other professionals who have involvement with the U.S. public markets.  We are generally subject to these requirements and applicable SEC rules and regulations.
Acquisitions 
The BHCA, the Bank Merger Act, West Virginia banking law, and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks and their parent holding companies. The BHCA requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the direct or indirect acquisition by a bank holding company of more than 5.0% of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FDIC or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for a non-member bank to merge with another bank or purchase substantially all of the assets or assume any deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act (see the section captioned “Community Reinvestment Act” included elsewhere in this item) and its compliance with consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.
8

Current federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without geographic limitation. Furthermore, a bank headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in another state, subject to market share limitations and any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of time. After a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where a bank headquartered in that state could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. These regulatory considerations are applicable to privately negotiated acquisition transactions.
Other Safety and Soundness Regulations
The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board has authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule, regulation, administrative order or written agreement with a federal regulator. These powers may be exercised through the issuance of cease and desist orders, civil money penalties or other actions.
Federal and state banking regulators also have broad enforcement powers over the Bank, including the power to impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a receiver in order to conserve the assets of the Bank for the benefit of depositors and other creditors. The West Virginia commissioner of banking also has the authority to take possession of a West Virginia state bank in certain circumstances, including, among other things, when it appears necessary in order to protect or preserve the assets of that bank for the benefit of depositors and other creditors.
Anti-Money Laundering and the USA PATRIOT Act
A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, or the USA Patriot Act, substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The USA Patriot Act contains anti-money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions. Financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. The USA Patriot Act includes the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, which grants the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions’ operations. The U.S. Treasury has issued a number of regulations to implement the USA Patriot Act under this authority requiring financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.
Incentive Compensation
The Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of this supervisory initiative will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated 
9

into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.
In June 2016, the Federal Reserve Board, other federal banking agencies, and the SEC jointly published a proposed rulemaking designed to strengthen the incentive-based compensation practices at covered institutions by better aligning the financial rewards for covered persons with an institution’s long-term safety and soundness. The proposed rule uses a tiered approach that applies provisions to covered financial institutions according to three categories of average total consolidated assets: Level 1 ($250 billion or more), Level 2 ($50 billion to $250 billion), and Level 3 ($1 billion to $50 billion). For all covered institutions, the proposed rule would (i) prohibit types and features of incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks because they are “excessive” or “could lead to material financial loss” at a covered institution, (ii) require incentive-based compensation arrangements to adhere to three basic principles: (1) a balance between risk and reward; (2) effective risk management and controls; and (3) effective governance, and (iii) require appropriate board or directors (or committee) oversight and record keeping and disclosures to the appropriate agency. For Level 1 and Level 2 institutions, the proposed rule would (i) require the following: the deferral of awards for senior executive officers and significant risk takers; the subjecting of unpaid and unvested incentive compensation to the risk of downward adjustments or forfeiture; the subjecting of paid incentive compensation to the risk of “clawback;” establishing a board compensation committee; expanded risk-management and control standards; additional record keeping requirements for senior executive officers and significant risk takers; and detailed policies and procedures to ensure rule compliance and (ii) prohibit certain inappropriate practices, including: the purchase of hedging instruments that offset decreases in the value of incentive compensation; allowing a range of payouts that might encourage risk taking; and basing compensation solely on comparison to peer and volume-driven incentives without regard to transaction quality or compliance with sound risk management. The comment period ended in July 2016.
If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to that initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our executives.
In addition, SEC regulations require public companies, like the Company, to provide various disclosures about executive compensation in annual reports and proxy statements and to present to their shareholders a non-binding vote on the approval of executive compensation.
The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on incentive compensation and SEC rulemaking with respect to executive compensation are continuing to develop.

The Volcker Rule implements section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act and prohibits insured depository institutions and affiliated companies (together, “banking entities”) from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, and commodity futures, and options on these instruments, for their own account and prohibits banking entities from investing in certain types of funds (“covered funds”). The requirements of the Volcker Rule as implemented and any proposed changes are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Volcker Rule does not significantly impact the operations of the Company and its subsidiary, as we do not have any significant engagement in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule. EGRRCPA exempts from the Volcker Rule banking entities with $10 billion or less in total consolidated assets and have total trading assets and trading liabilities that are less than 5% of total consolidated assets. Implementation of this provision is subject to a rulemaking which is in process. The Company and the Bank are below these thresholds and thus exempt from the Volcker Rule, subject to a rulemaking implementing this EGRRCPA provision. That rulemaking is in process.

Limit on Dividends
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company’s ability to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and for other cash requirements largely depends on the amount of dividends the Bank declares. However, the Federal Reserve Board expects the Company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank to reduce potential loss exposure to the Bank’s depositors and to the FDIC insurance fund in the event the Bank becomes insolvent or is in danger of becoming insolvent. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by the Company to the Bank would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the Bank. In the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
Accordingly, the Federal Reserve Board may require the Company to retain capital for further investment in the Bank, rather than pay dividends to its shareholders. The Bank may not pay dividends to the Company if, after paying those dividends, the Bank would fail to meet the required minimum levels under the risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage ratio requirements. The Bank must have the approval from the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions if a dividend in any year would cause the total dividends for that year to exceed the sum of the current year’s net earnings as defined and the retained earnings for the preceding two years as defined, less required transfers to surplus. These provisions could limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends on its outstanding common shares.
In addition, the Company and the Bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums (See “Capital Requirements”, below). The appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The appropriate federal regulatory authorities have stated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, in the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.
Transactions with Affiliates
Transactions between the Bank and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company or any other subsidiary, on the other hand, are regulated under federal banking law. The Federal Reserve Act, made applicable by section 8(j) of the FDIA, imposes quantitative and qualitative requirements and collateral requirements on covered transactions by the Bank with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates, and generally requires those transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to the Bank as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third party. Covered transactions are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve Board) from the affiliate, certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In general, any such transaction by the Bank or its subsidiaries must be limited to certain thresholds on an individual and aggregate basis and, for credit transactions with any affiliate, must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral.
Federal law also limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of non-repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate.
Capital Requirements
The Bank is required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the FDIC (“Capital Rules”). The Company is exempt from the Federal Reserve Board’s capital adequacy standards as it believes it meets the requirements of the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. State chartered banks, such as the Bank, are subject to similar capital requirements adopted by the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions.
11

The Capital Rules, among other things, (i) include a “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”) measure, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations.
Under the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios effective as of January 1, 2015 are:

• | 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;


• | 6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets;


• | 8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and


• | 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the leverage ratio”).

The Capital Rules also include a new “capital conservation buffer”, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The Capital Rules also provide for a “countercyclical capital buffer” that is only applicable to certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to the Company or the Bank. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and effectively increases the minimum required risk-weighted capital ratios. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets below the effective minimum (4.5% plus the capital conservation buffer and, if applicable, the countercyclical capital buffer) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
Since fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Capital Rules require the Bank to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%; and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. The Capital Rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1.
The Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the risk-weighting categories from the general risk-based capital rules to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.
In September 2017, the Federal Reserve Board, along with other bank regulatory agencies, proposed amendments to its capital requirements to simplify certain aspects of the capital rules for community banks, including the Bank, in an attempt to reduce the regulatory burden for such smaller financial institutions. Because the amendments were proposed with a request for comments and have not been finalized, we do not yet know what effect the final rules will have on the Bank’s capital calculations. In November 2017, the federal banking agencies extended for community banks the existing capital requirements for certain items, including mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interest, which were scheduled to change effective January 1, 2018, in light of the simplification amendments being considered.
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to the accounting standards for credit losses that included the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) methodology, which replaces the existing incurred loss methodology for certain financial assets. CECL becomes effective January 1, 2020. In December 2018, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved a final rule providing an option to phase-in, over a period of three years, the day-one regulatory capital effects resulting from the implementation of CECL.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the EGRRCPA simplifies capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for insured depository institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that such institutions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements under the Capital Rules. Such institutions that meet the community bank leverage ratio will automatically be deemed to be well-capitalized, although the regulators retain the flexibility to determine that the institution may not qualify for the community bank leverage ratio test based on the institution’s risk profile. The federal banking agencies have proposed a community bank leverage ratio of 9% with additional parameters, including limited amounts of off-balanced sheet exposure. That proposal has not been finalized, and until such time, the Capital Rules as described above remain in effect.  The effective date and specific requirements for the community bank leverage ratio are unknown.
With respect to the Bank, the Capital Rules also revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as discussed below under “Prompt Corrective Action.”
12

Prompt Corrective Action
The FDIA requires among other things, the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures, which reflect changes under the Capital Rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, are the total capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio.
A bank will be (i) “well capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) “adequately capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not “well capitalized”; (iii) “undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if the institution’s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.
As noted above, the EGRRCPA will eliminate these requirements for banks with less than $10.0 billion in assets who elect to follow the community bank leverage ratio once regulators finalize the regulation.
The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” “Undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.”
“Significantly undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.
The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution.
In addition to the “prompt corrective action” directives, failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies, including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities, termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the appointment of a conservator or receiver.

For further information regarding the capital ratios and leverage ratio of the Company and the Bank see the discussion under the section captioned “Capital/Stockholders’ Equity” included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14, “Regulatory Capital Requirements” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Safety and Soundness Standards
The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. See “Prompt Corrective Action” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.
Deposit Insurance
The Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system that determines assessment rates for an insured depository institution based on an assessment rate calculator, which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each insured depository institution poses to the FDIC insurance fund. The assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity, as defined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly.
Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
Depositor Preference
The FDIA provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the United States and the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) membership
The FHLB provides credit to its members in the form of advances. As a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, the Bank must maintain an investment in the capital stock of that FHLB in an amount equal to 0.10% of the calculated Member Asset Value (“MAV”) plus 4.00% of outstanding advances and 0.75% of outstanding letters of credit. The MAV is determined by taking line item values for various investment and loan classes and applying an FHLB haircut to each item. At December 31, 2018, the Bank held capital stock of FHLB in the amount of $11.3 million.
Federal and State Consumer Laws
The Company and the Bank are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in 
14

Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict our ability to raise interest rates and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general, and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.
Consumer Financial Protection
We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict our ability to raise interest rates and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal financial regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.
The CFPB is a federal agency responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. The CFPB also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, as well as their affiliates, which authority would not apply to the Company or the Bank. As the Bank’s principal federal regulator, the FDIC has examination and enforcement authority over the Bank.
The CFPB has concentrated much of its rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgage-related topics required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including mortgage origination disclosures, minimum underwriting standards and ability to repay, high-cost mortgage lending, and servicing practices. The CFPB issued final rules changing the reporting requirements for lenders under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The new rules expand the range of transactions subject to these requirements to include most securitized residential mortgage loans and credit lines. The rules also increase the overall amount of data required to be collected and submitted, including additional data points about the loans and borrowers. The expanded data is being collected as of January 1, 2018.
Financial Privacy
Federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions, including substantial customer privacy protections provided under the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (commonly known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act). Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions, an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer 
15

is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means. In December 2015, Congress amended the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act privacy provisions to include an exception under which if a financial institution meets certain conditions, it is not required to provide annual privacy notices to customers. In August 2018, the CFPB finalized a rule implementing this provision, and that rule became effective September 17, 2018.
Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation
Federal regulators have adopted consumer protection regulations and guidance related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions. Regulation E prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. Financial institutions must also provide consumers with a notice that explains the financial institution’s overdraft services, including the fees associated with the service and the consumer’s choices. In addition, FDIC-supervised institutions must monitor overdraft payment programs for “excessive or chronic” customer use and undertake “meaningful and effective” follow-up action with customers that overdraw their accounts more than six times during a rolling 12-month period. Financial institutions must also impose daily limits on overdraft charges, review and modify check-clearing procedures, prominently distinguish account balances from available overdraft coverage amounts and ensure board and management oversight regarding overdraft payment programs.
Community Reinvestment Act
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. The CRA requires the Bank’s primary federal bank regulatory agency, the FDIC, to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.”
In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHCA, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHCA, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the CRA. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering a request for an approval of a proposed transaction to consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an insured depository institution, or to open or relocate a branch office.
Cybersecurity
In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.
In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding our defensive measures, the threat from cyber-attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to date, we are not aware that we have experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. For further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Monetary Policy and Economic Conditions
The business of financial institutions is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board regulates money and credit conditions and interest rates to influence general economic conditions primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in the reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits. These policies and regulations significantly affect the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans, as well as the interest rates paid on deposit accounts.
The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to have significant effects in the future. In view of the changing conditions in the economy and the money markets and the activities of monetary and fiscal authorities, the Company cannot predict future changes in interest rates, credit availability or deposit levels.
Effect of Environmental Regulation
The Company’s primary exposure to environmental risk is through its lending activities. In cases when management believes environmental risk potentially exists, the Company mitigates its environmental risk exposures by requiring environmental site assessments at the time of loan origination to confirm collateral quality as to commercial real estate parcels posing higher than normal potential for environmental impact, as determined by reference to present and past uses of the subject property and adjacent sites. Environmental assessments are typically required prior to any foreclosure activity involving non-residential real estate collateral.
With regard to residential real estate lending, management reviews those loans with inherent environmental risk on an individual basis and makes decisions based on the dollar amount of the loan and the materiality of the specific credit.
The Company anticipates no material effect on anticipated capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal, state or local environmental protection laws or regulations.
Other Regulatory Matters
The Company is subject to examinations and investigations by federal and state banking regulators, as well as the SEC, various taxing authorities and various state regulators. The Company periodically receives requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state insurance commissions and state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning the Company’s business and accounting practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.
Future Legislation and Regulation
Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which we operate and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to our business strategy, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
