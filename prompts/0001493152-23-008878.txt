Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Motorsport Games is a leading racing game developer, publisher and esports ecosystem provider of official motorsport racing series throughout the world, including NASCAR, the iconic 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race (“Le Mans”) and the associated FIA World Endurance Championship (the “WEC”), INDYCAR, the British Touring Car Championship (the “BTCC”) and others. Our portfolio is comprised of some of the most prestigious motorsport leagues and events in the world. Further, in 2021 we acquired the KartKraft karting simulation game as well as Studio 397 B.V. (“Studio397”) and their rFactor 2 realistic racing simulator technology and platform, adding both games and their underlying technology to our portfolio.
 
Motorsport Games’ purpose is to make the thrill of motorsports accessible to everyone by creating the highest quality, most sophisticated and innovative experiences for racers, gamers and fans of all ages. Our products and services target a large global motorsport audience. The latest figures reported from 2021 show NASCAR, INDYCAR and Le Mans, which includes the WEC, having an estimated combined global fanbase of over 1 billion, while the global fanbase for Formula 1 was estimated to be 757 million. Motorsport Games scales its business by releasing more games on more platforms under unique licenses, while continuing to evolve scalable technology platforms to “wow” users.
 
Started in 2018 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Motorsport Network, we are currently the official developer and publisher of the NASCAR video game racing franchise and have obtained the official licenses to develop multi-platform games for the BTCC, the 24 Hours of Le Mans race and the WEC, as well as INDYCAR. We develop and publish multi-platform racing video games for consoles (such as Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch), personal computers (PCs) and mobile platforms (such as iOS and Android) through various retail and digital channels, including full-game and downloadable content. For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, a majority of our revenue was generated from sales of our NASCAR racing video games.
 
According to data from NewZoo, an industry source for games market insight and analytics, total global mobile gaming revenues were estimated to be 92.2 billion for 2022. We presently offer NASCAR Heat Mobile for iOS and Android and continue to evaluate further opportunities to add to our mobile gaming portfolio to capture this large audience.
 
We are striving to become a leader in organizing and facilitating esports tournaments, competitions, and events for our licensed racing games. 2022 was another successful year in esports, which began with the grand finale of the second running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual in January, the INDYCAR-Motorsport Games Pro Challenge in February and the continuation and re-brand of elite single seater esports rFactor 2 Formula Pro. The year concluded with the first 4 rounds of the 2022-23 Le Mans Virtual Series in September, October, November and December. In addition, we also organized competitions to drive user engagement on our rFactor 2 platform, as well as successfully delivering onsite esports activations with rFactor 2 at selected BTCC events in Autumn. For 2022, our esports events had a cumulative total of approximately 2.3 million video views with approximately 6.3 million minutes watched. Subsequently, in the first quarter of 2023, we announced our viewership figures for the 2022-23 Le Mans Virtual Series, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual, which had a global audience of 8.5 million across television (TV)/over-the-top (OTT) channels, 36 million social media impressions and over 10 million video views across the full 5-race season. We continue to leverage esports competitions to bring wider awareness to our gaming products, while creating events that are adventures for viewers.
 
We believe that connecting virtual racing gamers, motorsport and esports fans on a digital entertainment and social platform represents the greatest opportunity to enhance the way that people learn, watch, play, and experience racing video games and racing esports. To that end, we have developed Traxion, a collective of racing, esports and gaming enthusiasts building a positive community of likeminded gamers, sim racers. After launching in 2021, Traxion continues to grow across social, video and editorial channels, while feeding the community the latest news, reviews, updates, opinions, and insight from the most recognized and respected names from the world of racing games. In 2022, Traxion published over 2,000 articles and attracted nearly 10 million pageviews.

Company Background
 
Motorsport Games was formed in 2018 by Motorsport Network as a wholly-owned subsidiary in connection with the acquisition by Motorsport Games of a controlling interest in 704Games Company (“704Games”), which holds the exclusive license to be the official video game developer and publisher for the NASCAR video game racing franchise, subject to certain limited exceptions. Simultaneously with the acquisition of 704Games in 2018, we extended the NASCAR license for 10 years until December 31, 2029. In addition, we have the exclusive right to create and organize esports leagues and events for NASCAR using our NASCAR racing video games, subject to certain limited exceptions.
 
We entered into an agreement to facilitate the Le Mans Esports Series as part of a joint venture with Automobile Club de l’Ouest (“ACO”), the organizer of the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race in 2019. Through our ownership interest in this joint venture, which was increased to 51% from 45% in January 2021, we secured the rights to be the exclusive video game developer and publisher for the 24 Hours of Le Mans race and the WEC, which the 24 Hours of Le Mans race is a part of, for a ten-year period. In addition, through this joint venture with ACO, we have the right to create and organize esports leagues and events for the Le Mans Esports Series.
 
In May 2020, we secured a multi-year licensing agreement to exclusively develop and publish the video games for the BTCC racing series across console, mobile and casual gaming channels. In addition, through this license, we have the right to create and organize esports leagues and events for the BTCC racing series. The agreement expires on December 31, 2026.
 
In January 2021, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”). Prior to our IPO, Motorsport Games was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Motorsport Network and, following the completion of our IPO, Motorsport Network continues to be our majority stockholder.
 
In March 2021, we acquired all assets comprising the KartKraft computer video game from Black Delta Holdings PTY, Black Delta Trading Pty Ltd and Black Delta IP Pty Ltd (collectively, “Black Delta”). Through this acquisition, we entered the simulated kart-racing space and formed Motorsport Games Australia Pty Ltd. to support the Black Delta development team, which joined Motorsport Games Australia following the acquisition.
 
In April 2021, we acquired the remaining equity interests in 704Games Company whereby 704Games Company merged with 704Games LLC, a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company and our wholly-owned subsidiary, with 704Games LLC being the surviving entity in such merger.
 
In April 2021, we also acquired Studio397, the company behind the industry leading rFactor 2 racing simulation platform, from Luminis International BV. Following this acquisition, Studio397 continues its work on the rFactor 2 platform while also developing the physics and handling models for our other official games. We continue to utilize our resources and expertise to enhance the rFactor 2 platform, especially in areas highlighted by the racing community.
 
In July 2021, we entered into certain license agreements with INDYCAR LLC to use certain licensed intellectual property for motorsports and/or racing video gaming products and esports events related to, themed as, or containing the INDYCAR SERIES. The license agreements are long-term agreements, in connection with which the parties intend to create a relationship for the development of video games and events to be the official video games and esports events of the INDYCAR SERIES.

Esports Partnerships and Franchises
 
We recognize the growing importance and business viability of esports, especially within the racing and motorsport genres. In recognition of this importance, we manage and operate the esports platforms for numerous racing series and organizations. 2022 was another successful year in esports which began with the second running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual in January, the continuation and re-brand of elite single seater esports rFactor 2 Formula Pro as well as the INDYCAR-Motorsport Games Pro Challenge. In addition, we also organized competitions to drive user engagement on our rFactor 2 platform, as well as successfully delivering onsite esports activations with rFactor 2 at selected BTCC events in Autumn. In 2021, we organized several esports competitions, including the DiRT Rally 2.0 World Series on the popular Codemasters game, the Winter Heat and Summer Showdown on NASCAR Heat 5, and the expansion of the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual event into a part of a longer annual series towards the end of the year with professional teams and real-world racing drivers. In addition, we also organized competitions to drive user engagement on our rFactor 2 platform.

Pursuant to a promotion agreement we entered into with Motorsport Network in August 2018, Motorsport Network provides us with exclusive promotion services consisting of the use of its and its affiliates’ various media platforms to promote our business, organizations, products and services in racing video games and related esports activities. Our relationship with Motorsport Network provides us access to its highly engaged, brand-loyal and affluent audience, including in the form of editorial coverage, ad stack and special organic integrations that puts us in front of this targeted audience. We believe this allows us to cultivate a passionate fanbase to engage in our offered products and services that is similar to the target audience for our racing game products, and racing esports events and platform. We also believe this audience has a passion for everything motorsport and auto-related. This promotion agreement will remain in effect until such date that Motorsport Network no longer holds at least 20% of the voting interest in Motorsport Games, at which point we anticipate being able to extend or re-negotiate the promotion agreement on reasonable terms.
 
We have also continued to invest in and expand our audience base through traditional marketing and sales distribution channels including Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, YouTube and other online social networks, as well as our own platform – Traxion – which is a source of information and news for all things relating to virtual racing and esports.
 
Revenues
 
We currently generate revenue primarily by selling our racing video game products for video game consoles, PC, and mobile platforms through various retail and digital channels, including full-game and downloadable content. In addition, we began providing product development services to third-parties for the first time in 2022 that included the ongoing support and maintenance of developed software.
 
Our esports business generates revenues from sponsorships, advertising and media rights for events and competitions. In addition, should audience patterns continue to grow, we believe the esports business has the potential to generate incremental revenues through the further sale of media rights to the Company’s esports events and competitions, as well as merchandising and sports betting.
 
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution
 
Many of our products contain software that enables us to connect with our gamers directly, including through customized advertising and in-game messaging based on customer preferences and trends. This provides a significant marketing tool that allows us to communicate and market directly to our customers.
 
Other direct marketing efforts include activities on Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, YouTube and other online social networks, online advertising, public relations activity, print and broadcast advertising, coordinated in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase displays), participation in cooperative advertising programs, direct response vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software distributed through the Internet or the digital online services provided by our partners. Our relationship with Motorsport Network also provides us access to their highly engaged, brand-loyal and affluent audience, including in the form of editorial coverage, ad stack and special organic integrations that puts us in front of this targeted audience.
 
From time to time, we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers, producers of consumer products related to a game, and retailers in connection with their own promotional efforts, as well as co-marketing from promotional partners. For example, through our partnership with NASCAR, we benefit from having access to their extensive fanbase and social and digital media audience to market our products through email marketing campaigns, coordinated social media advertising and collaborated press releases, further expanding NASCAR and racing enthusiasts’ awareness of our products. This is similar with our other partnerships with INDYCAR, Le Mans, WEC, BTCC, Formula E and others.

Additionally, 704Games is a 50/50 joint venture partner with an affiliate of Race Team Alliance (“RTA”) to develop the eNHPL. RTA is an organization consisting of 16 NASCAR Cup Series teams and supports the promotion of eNASCAR Heat Pro League (“eNHPL”) events through their individual team social and digital platforms, among other things, including by cross-posting Facebook livestreams of race broadcasts, adding eNHPL specific pages on team/sponsor websites, displaying tune-in graphics and digital promotions, generating creative content with specific eNHPL drivers, supporting NASCAR Heat social and digital content, and integrating with existing partners and more. Most notable, the RTA teams include the eNHPL and NASCARHeat.com logos on the contingency space on each of their NASCAR Cup Series vehicles for a number of NASCAR events. The contingency space is located behind the front tire and in front of the car number, placing the logos in prime sponsorship space on the race car. These logos are clearly visible on the cars during televised race action and are also clearly seen in Victory Lane photos, leading to increased awareness about the eNHPL and the NASCAR Heat franchise through this unique promotional channel.
 
We also are able to sell directly to consumers through various digital platforms. Our products and content are available for consumers to purchase and download at their convenience directly to their video game console, PC, or mobile device through our platform partners, including Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”), Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. (“Sony”), Apple Inc. (“Apple”), Nintendo Co., Ltd. (“Nintendo”), Google and Steam.
 
Our physical gaming products are sold through a distribution network with an exclusive partner who specializes in the distribution of games through mass-market retailers (e.g., Target, Wal-Mart), consumer electronics stores (e.g., Best Buy), discount warehouses, game specialty stores (e.g., GameStop) and other online retail stores (e.g., Amazon). We expect to continue to derive significant revenues from sales of our physical gaming products to a very limited number of distribution partners. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we sold substantially all of our physical disk products for the retail channel through a single distribution partner, which represented approximately 9% and 28% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
Customer Concentration
 
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, three customers accounted for approximately 61% and four customer accounted for 83% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues in those periods. For the year ended December 31, 2022, four customers accounted for approximately 90% of our accounts receivable, and for the year ended December 31, 2021, two customers accounted for approximately 70% of our accounts receivable. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our accounts receivable in those periods. A reduction in sales from or loss of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
Digital Marketing Strategy
 
As part of our plan to maximize our revenues and product offerings, we utilize an audience-centric approach, by collecting audience data across all of our products, platforms, campaigns, attribution models, and analytics tools. These metrics are then turned into actionable insights for use in the development of our games and esports offerings.
 
We monitor audience data to improve our understanding of three key areas—consumer behavioral changes, brand perception, and location in the sales funnel—which in turn allows us to build relationships with our customers and brand partners.
 
We use this audience intelligence to personalize messaging, product positioning, and creatives based on user signals and their position in the sales funnel. We believe this strategy is designed to minimize ad spend waste, increase customer conversion and thereby increase our return on investment.

Strategic Licenses and Partnerships
 
NASCAR
 
We are currently party to a series of license agreements with NASCAR for worldwide rights to use the NASCAR brand. Through our acquisition of 704Games in 2018, we obtained the exclusive right, subject to certain limited exceptions, to use certain licensed rights (including the rights of certain NASCAR teams) to develop, promote, advertise, distribute, manufacture and package simulation-style video gaming products, which are NASCAR-branded video game products. These games have a stock car and/or truck racing theme relating to NASCAR-sanctioned events intended to replicate authentic NASCAR racing competition rules and structure. The limited exceptions to this exclusive right represent third-party NASCAR- branded casual games, which may incorporate some mix of core characteristics of simulation-style video gaming products provided they are utilized with additional distinguishing creative liberties which are not consistent with authentic NASCAR racing. We also have a non-exclusive right to use certain licensed rights (including the rights of certain NASCAR teams) to develop, promote, advertise, distribute, manufacture and package other NASCAR-branded driving or non-driving gaming products.
 
In addition, we have the exclusive right to use NASCAR-branded simulation-style video gaming products as the platform for conducting and administering esports leagues and events for NASCAR. Such exclusivity excludes esports events relating to iRacing, which is a NASCAR-sanctioned motorsport racing simulation currently available for the PC platform and designed to imitate exact NASCAR racing physics and conditions (including for certain NASCAR racing series), and certain competitive gaming events that fall outside of the exclusivity granted to us.
 
Our current license arrangement with NASCAR expires on December 31, 2029. The license arrangement provides for a commitment by both parties to participate in exclusive negotiations to renew the license, beginning March 1, 2028, with negotiations lasting for at least 90 days. The license arrangement also requires us to pay royalties, including certain minimum annual guarantees, on an ongoing basis to NASCAR and to meet certain product distribution, development, marketing and related milestones.
 
24 Hours of Le Mans
 
On March 15, 2019, we formed Le Mans Esports Series Limited as a joint venture between Motorsport Games and ACO with the primary purpose of carrying on the promotion of and running of an esports event business replicating races of the WEC and the 24 Hours of Le Mans race on an electronic gaming platform. Through our ownership interest in this joint venture, which was increased to 51% from 45% in January 2021, we secured the rights to be the exclusive video game developer and publisher for the 24 Hours of Le Mans race and the WEC through a separate license agreement. This license expires 10 years beginning from the date of our first release of a WEC or Le Mans race video gaming product with the term automatically renewing for an additional ten-year term unless ACO provides written notice of its intent not to renew. In exchange for such license, we agreed to fund up to €8,000,000 (approximately $8,530,000 USD as of December 31, 2022) as needed for development of the video game products, to be contributed on an as-needed basis during the term of the license. Additionally, we are obligated to pay ACO an annual payment beginning from the time of the launch of the first video game product and continuing on each anniversary thereof for the term of the license. In addition, through this joint venture, we have the right to create and organize esports leagues and events for the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, the WEC and the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual event through certain additional license agreements. These additional license agreements, which were granted on a royalty-free basis, each expire January 25, 2031 with the term automatically renewing for an additional ten-year term unless ACO provides written notice of its intent not to renew. This joint venture shall continue until the earlier of the date on which the parties cease to be beneficially entitled in the aggregate to 25% or more of the equity share capital of the joint venture, the parties otherwise cease to control the affairs of the joint venture or the date of the commencement of the winding-up of the joint venture. If certain events of defaults occur, the non-defaulting party has a call option pursuant to which it can force the defaulting party to sell all (but not part) of its ownership in the joint venture in accordance with the joint venture agreement.

BTCC
 
On May 29, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with BARC (TOCA) Limited (“BARC”), the exclusive promoter of the BTCC. Pursuant to the agreement, we were granted an exclusive license to use certain licensed intellectual property for motorsports and/or racing video gaming products related to, themed as, or containing the BTCC, on consoles and mobile applications, esports series and esports events (including our esports platform). In exchange for the license, the agreement required us to pay BARC an initial fee in two equal installments of $100,000 each, both of which were made prior to their respective due dates. Following the initial fee, the agreement also requires us to pay royalties, including certain minimum annual guarantees, on an ongoing basis to BARC and to meet certain product distribution, marketing and related milestones, subject to termination penalties. The agreement shall remain in effect through December 31, 2026. However, if BARC’s agreement with the Royal Automobile Club Motor Sport Association Limited to promote the BTCC is extended, BARC shall notify us and discussions for an extension of the license agreement shall take place no later than March 31, 2026. Except in the event of termination for breach, a sell off period will begin and continue until the earlier of 180 days from such termination or December 31, 2026.
INDYCAR
 
On July 13, 2021, we entered into a royalty-bearing license agreement (the “INDYCAR Gaming License”) with INDYCAR LLC. Pursuant to the INDYCAR Gaming License, INDYCAR LLC licensed us to use certain licensed intellectual property (described in the INDYCAR Gaming License) for motorsports and/or racing video gaming products related to, themed as, or containing the INDYCAR SERIES. The INDYCAR Gaming License is a long-term agreement, in connection with which the parties intend to form an exclusive relationship for the development of video games to be the official video games of the INDYCAR SERIES.
 
In exchange for the INDYCAR Gaming License, we will pay to INDYCAR an annual development fee during calendar years 2021 and 2022, after which we will pay INDYCAR a royalty fee equal to a certain percentage of sales of physical and digital video gaming products, subject to certain annual minimum royalty guarantees. We have agreed under the INDYCAR Gaming License to provide advertising and publicity to bring the INDYCAR SERIES racing video gaming products to the attention of as many purchasers and potential purchasers as possible.
 
Additionally, we and INDYCAR entered into a royalty-bearing license agreement with INDYCAR which licensed us to use certain INDYCAR intellectual property (“Licensed IP”) for motorsports and/or racing esports events related to, themed as, or containing the INDYCAR SERIES (including the rFactor 2 platform) (the “INDYCAR Esports License”). The INDYCAR Esports License is a long-term agreement, in connection with which the parties intend to form an exclusive relationship for the development of events to be the official esports events of the INDYCAR SERIES, which include the esports events related to and/or themed as or containing the Licensed IP and related features which, prior to launch, are hosted on our rFactor 2 platform and, after launch of the products, are hosted using the products.
 
RTA
 
On February 18, 2019, we formed the Racing Pro League, LLC a 50/50 partnership between our subsidiary 704Games and an affiliate of RTA, with the primary purpose to create, own and operate the eNHPL, a stock car and/or stock truck racing themed esports multiplayer competition video gaming league based on the NASCAR Heat video game series.

This partnership shall continue until dissolved by the approval of the board of Racing Pro League, LLC and each of 704Games and RTA, as members, or as required by law.

Epic Games
 
On August 11, 2020, through our wholly owned subsidiary, MS Gaming Development LLC, we entered into a licensing agreement with Epic Games International (“Epic”) for worldwide licensing rights to Epic’s proprietary computer program known as the Unreal Engine 4. This Agreement was assigned from MS Gaming Development LLC to Motorsport Games Inc. on September 3, 2021.
 
Pursuant to the agreement, we were granted a nonexclusive, non-transferable and terminable license to develop, market and sublicense (under limited circumstances and subject to conditions of the agreement) certain products using the Unreal Engine 4 for our next generation of games. In exchange for the license, the agreement requires us to pay Epic an initial license fee, royalties, support fees and supplemental license fees for additional platforms.  During a two-year support period, Epic will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide us with updates to the Unreal Engine 4 and technical support via a licensee forum. After the expiration of the support period, Epic has no further obligation to provide or to offer to provide any support services. The agreement is effective until terminated under the provisions of the agreement; however, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we can only actively develop new or existing authorized products during a five-year active development period, which terminates on August 11, 2025. 
 
Arrangements with Console Manufacturers
 
Under the terms of agreements entered into separately with Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo and their affiliates, we are authorized to develop and distribute disc-based and digitally-delivered software products and services compatible with PlayStation, Xbox and Switch consoles, respectively. Under these agreements with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, we have the non-exclusive right to use, for the specified term and in a designated territory, technology that is owned or licensed by them to publish our games on their respective consoles. With respect to our digitally delivered products and services, the console manufacturers pay us either a wholesale price or a royalty percentage on the revenue they derive from their sales of our products and services. Our transactions for packaged goods products are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, which are accepted on a case-by case basis by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo (or their designated replicators), as the case may be. For packaged goods products, we pay the console manufacturers a per-unit royalty for each unit manufactured. Many key commercial terms of our relationships with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, such as manufacturing terms, delivery times, policies and approval conditions, are determined unilaterally, and are subject to change by the console manufacturers.
 
The license agreements also require us to indemnify the console manufacturers for any loss, liability and expense resulting from any claim against the console manufacturer regarding our games and services, including any claims for patent, copyright or trademark infringement brought against the console manufacturer. Each license may be terminated by the console manufacturer or shall terminate if a breach or default by us is not cured after we receive written notice from the console manufacturer, or if we become insolvent. The console manufacturers are not obligated to enter into license agreements with us for any future consoles, products or services.
 
Product Development and Support
 
We develop and produce our titles using a model in which a group of creative, technical, and production professionals, including among others, designers, producers, programmers, artists, and sound engineers, in coordination with our marketing, finance, analytics, sales, and other professionals, has responsibility for the entire development and production process, including the supervision and coordination of, where appropriate, external resources. We believe this model allows us to deploy the best resources for a given task, by supplementing our internal expertise with top-quality external resources on an as-needed basis.
 
In addition to our experienced development team, we also rely, in part, on third-party software developers for the partial development of our titles. From time to time, we also acquire the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products. Additionally, in April 2021, we acquired Studio397, the company behind the industry leading rFactor 2 racing simulation platform, as discussed above. Following this acquisition, Studio397 continues its work on the rFactor 2 platform while also developing the physics and handling models for our other project games.
 
We also provide various forms of product support. Central technology and development teams review, assess, and provide support to products throughout the development process. Quality assurance personnel are also involved throughout the development and production of published content. We subject all such content to extensive testing before public release to ensure compatibility with appropriate hardware systems and configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and other defects found in the products. To support our content, we generally provide rapid game support to players through various means, primarily online through our social media channels.

Competition
 
The interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly introduced. We believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment industry include: product features, game quality, and playability; brand name recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; online capability and functionality; ease of use; price; marketing support; and quality of customer service.
 
We compete with other publishers of virtual racing video games for console, PC, and mobile entertainment, including Codemasters and other major video game publishers and esports companies, such as Electronic Arts. In addition to third-party software competitors, integrated video game console hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, compete directly with us in the development of game titles for their respective platforms, including titles in the motorsport racing genre, even though they generally cannot create branded NASCAR, Le Mans, INDYCAR or BTCC games for which we hold licenses. A number of software publishers have developed and commercialized, or are currently developing, online games for use by consumers, and we must compete with them for our audience base.
 
In a broad sense, we compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive entertainment companies, as well as with providers of different forms of entertainment, such as film, television, social networking, music and other consumer products.
 
Seasonality in Our Business
 
Historically, we have seen a high degree of seasonality in our business and financial results due to the introduction of seasonal video game updates. We generally aim to synchronize these yearly video game updates with the start of the new racing season and race calendars. Overall, our sales volumes are strongest around the time we launch our new products and also tend to be stronger at the start of the NASCAR racing season. We expect similar patterns for new racing series we are or may be in the process of developing and publishing in the future. We have also historically experienced a higher demand for our games during our fourth calendar quarter due to seasonal holiday demand.
Employees
 
Our business relies on our ability to attract and retain the right team to enable us to be a leading game developer, publisher and esports ecosystem provider of official motorsport racing series throughout the world. We invest heavily in hiring and retaining talented people, particularly as we grow our business. Our headcount as of December 31, 2022 was 134, of which 133 were full-time employees, including 91 developers, located primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and the Republic of Georgia. None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe that relations with our employees are generally good.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and mobile platforms, including those relating to privacy, use and protection of player and employee personal information and data (including the collection of data from minors), the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, content, advertising and marketing activities (including sweepstakes, contests and giveaways), and anti-corruption. Many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing, and the application to, and ultimate impact on, us is uncertain. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our players, and deliver products and services, and may significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations, our compliance requirements and costs will increase, and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Government regulations applicable to us may negatively impact our business” of this Report for additional information.

Intellectual Property
 
Our business is based on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, trademarks and copyrights, and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to enable them to run properly on multiple platforms. Other intellectual property we integrate includes audio-visual elements, including graphics, music and interface design.
 
While most of the intellectual property we use has been created or acquired by us, we have licensed rights to certain significant proprietary intellectual property. We have also licensed rights from third parties to use certain significant marquee racing brands and related intellectual property (See, “Strategic Licenses and Partnerships”). These agreements typically limit our use of the third party’s respective intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods, in consideration for up-front and recurring royalty payments that are typically based upon our sales of the respective products.
 
We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with third parties. We also engage in monitoring and enforcement activities with respect to infringing uses of our intellectual property by third parties.
 
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, trade dress and domain names to protect our games and other intellectual property. We typically own the copyright to the software code to our content, as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our games are marketed. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States.
 
Corporate History and Available Information
 
Motorsport Gaming US LLC was organized as a limited liability company on August 2, 2018 under the laws of the State of Florida. On January 8, 2021, Motorsport Gaming US LLC converted into a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion and changed its name to Motorsport Games Inc. in connection with our IPO. Effective as of January 8, 2021, 100% of the membership interests held by the sole member of Motorsport Gaming US LLC, Motorsport Network, converted into an aggregate of (i) 700,000 shares of Class A common stock of Motorsport Games Inc., which have 1 vote per share (the “MSN Initial Class A Shares”) and (ii) 700,000 shares of Class B common stock, which have 10 votes per share, of Motorsport Games Inc., which represented all of the outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock immediately following the corporate conversion. Motorsport Network is the only holder of shares of the Company’s Class B common stock and does not have any transfer, conversion, registration, or economic rights with respect to such shares of Class B common stock.
 
In November 2022, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to effectuate a reverse split of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10. Shares underlying outstanding equity-based awards were proportionately decreased and the respective per share exercise prices, if applicable, were proportionately increased in accordance with the terms of the agreements governing such securities. There was no change in the par value of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock as a result of the reverse stock split.
