ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Introduction
Cedar Fair, L.P. (together with its affiliated companies, the "Partnership") is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 1987 and managed by Cedar Fair Management, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "General Partner"), whose shares are held by an Ohio trust. The Partnership is one of the largest regional amusement park operators in the world and owns eleven amusement parks, two separately gated outdoor water parks, one indoor water park and four hotels. 
In 2018, the Partnership entertained approximately 26 million visitors. All of the Partnership's parks are family-oriented, with recreational facilities for people of all ages, and provide clean and attractive environments with exciting rides and entertainment. The amusement parks include: Cedar Point, located on Lake Erie between Cleveland and Toledo in Sandusky, Ohio; Knott's Berry Farm, near Los Angeles, California; Canada's Wonderland, near Toronto, Canada; Kings Island, near Cincinnati, Ohio; Carowinds, in Charlotte, North Carolina; Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom ("Dorney Park"), in Allentown, Pennsylvania; Kings Dominion, near Richmond, Virginia; California's Great America, in Santa Clara, California; Valleyfair, near Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota; Worlds of Fun, in Kansas City, Missouri; and Michigan's Adventure, in Muskegon, Michigan. The Partnership manages and operates Gilroy Gardens Family Theme Park in Gilroy, California.
The Partnership also owns and operates two separately gated outdoor water parks located adjacent to Cedar Point and Knott's Berry Farm, three hotels at Cedar Point (including the Castaway Bay Indoor Waterpark Resort in Sandusky, Ohio) and one hotel at Knott's Berry Farm. With limited exceptions, all rides and attractions at the amusement and water parks are owned and operated by the Partnership. The Partnership owns land on which Cedar Point Sports Center is located. The sports park is operated by a third party.
The Partnership's seasonal amusement parks are generally open during weekends beginning in April or May, and then daily from Memorial Day until Labor Day, after which they are open during weekends in September and, in most cases, October for Halloween events. The two separately gated outdoor water parks also operate seasonally, generally from Memorial Day to Labor Day, plus some additional weekends before and after this period. As a result, a substantial portion of the Partnership's revenues from these parks are generated during an approximate 130- to 140-day operating season with the major portion concentrated in the third quarter during the peak vacation months of July and August. In 2018, California's Great America, Carowinds, Worlds of Fun, Kings Island and Kings Dominion also hosted WinterFest, a 20 to 25 day holiday event operating during November and December showcasing holiday shows and festivities. In 2019, Canada's Wonderland will also extend its operating season by 20 to 25 days to include WinterFest. Knott's Berry Farm continues to be open daily on a year-round basis. Castaway Bay is also generally open daily from Memorial Day to Labor Day with an additional limited daily schedule for the balance of the year. Each park charges a basic daily admission price, which allows unlimited use of most rides and attractions. 
The demographic groups that are most important to the parks are families and young people ages 12 through 24. Families are believed to be attracted by a combination of rides, live entertainment and the clean, wholesome atmosphere. Young people are believed to be attracted by the action-packed rides. During their operating season, the parks conduct active television, radio, newspaper and internet advertising campaigns in their major market areas geared toward these two groups.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL
The Partnership believes that annual park attendance is influenced by annual investments in new attractions. Capital expenditures are planned on a seasonal basis with the majority of such capital expenditures made prior to the beginning of the peak operating season. Capital expenditures made in a calendar year may differ materially from amounts identified with a particular operating season because of timing considerations such as weather conditions, site preparation requirements and availability of ride components, which may result in accelerated or delayed expenditures around calendar year-end.
During the operating season, the Partnership carries significant receivables and inventories of food and merchandise, as well as payables and payroll-related accruals. Amounts are substantially reduced in non-operating periods. Seasonal working capital needs are funded from current operations and revolving credit facilities. Revolving credit facilities are established at levels sufficient to accommodate the Partnership's peak borrowing requirements in April and May as the seasonal parks complete preparations for opening. Revolving credit borrowings are reduced with the Partnership's positive cash flow during the seasonal operating period.
COMPETITION
The Partnership competes for discretionary spending with all aspects of the recreation industry within its primary market areas, including other destination and regional amusement parks. The Partnership also competes with other forms of entertainment and recreational activities, including movies, sports events, restaurants and vacation travel. 
The principal competitive factors in the amusement park industry include the uniqueness and perceived quality of the rides and attractions in a particular park, its proximity to metropolitan areas, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the park, and the quality and variety of the food and entertainment available. The Partnership believes that its amusement parks feature a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, restaurants, gift shops and family atmosphere to make them highly competitive with other parks and forms of entertainment.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
The Partnership's properties and operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Currently, the Partnership believes it is in substantial compliance with applicable requirements under these laws and regulations. However, such requirements have generally become stricter over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to its properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future.
All rides are operated and inspected daily by both the Partnership's maintenance and ride operations personnel before being placed into operation for our guests. The parks are also periodically inspected by the Partnership's insurance carrier and, at all parks except Valleyfair, Worlds of Fun, and Carowinds' South Carolina rides, by state or county ride-safety inspectors. Valleyfair, Worlds of Fun and Carowinds each contract with a third party to inspect its rides pursuant to Minnesota, Missouri, and South Carolina law, respectively, and submit the third-party report to the respective state agency. Additionally, all parks have added ride maintenance and operation inspections completed by third party qualified inspectors to make sure the Partnership's standards are being maintained.

The Partnership has approximately 2,200 full-time employees. During the operating season, the Partnership employs in aggregate approximately 45,100 seasonal and part-time employees, many of whom are high school and college students. Approximately 4,100 of Cedar Point's seasonal employees, 400 of Kings Dominion's, and 400 of Valleyfair's seasonal employees live in dormitories owned by the Partnership.
