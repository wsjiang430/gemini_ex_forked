 Business of Tri Counties Bank 
 The Bank was incorporated as a California banking corporation on June 26, 1974, and received its certificate of authority to conduct banking operations on March 11, 1975. The Bank engages in the general commercial banking business in 29 counties in Northern and Central California. 
 The Bank provides a breadth of personal, small business and commercial financial services including accepting demand, savings and time deposits and making small business, commercial, real estate, and consumer loans, as well as a range of Treasury Management Services and other customary banking services including safe deposit boxes. Brokerage services are provided at the Banks offices by the Banks arrangement with Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., an independent financial services provider and broker-dealer. 
 Over 80% of the Banks customers are personal banking customers. Less than 20% are business and commercial banking customers serving a diversity of industry types including manufacturing, real estate development, retail, wholesale, transportation, agriculture, commerce and professional services. The majority of the Banks loans are direct loans made to individuals and businesses in Northern and Central California where its branches are located. At December 31, 2018, the Banks consumer loans net of deferred fees outstanding was $418,982,000 (10.4%), commercial loans outstanding were $276,548,000 (6.9%), and real estate loans including construction loans of $183,384,000 were $3,326,484,000 (82.7%) of total loans.

 Merger with FNB Bancorp 
 On December 11, 2017, the Company and FNB Bancorp (FNBB), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Merger Agreement) pursuant to which FNBB will be merged with and into TriCo, with TriCo as the surviving corporation (the Merger). The Merger Agreement provided that immediately after the Merger, FNBBs bank subsidiary, First National Bank of Northern California (First National Bank), will merge with and into TriCos bank subsidiary, Tri Counties Bank, with Tri Counties Bank as the surviving bank (the Bank Merger). The Merger and Bank Merger are collectively referred to as the Merger Transaction. 
 The Merger Agreement provided that each share of FNBB common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger would be canceled and converted into the right to receive 0.98 shares of TriCo common stock (the Exchange Ratio), with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of TriCo common stock. 
 Based on the closing price of TriCo common stock of $41.64 on December 8, 2017, the consideration value was $40.81 per share of FNBB common stock or approximately $315.3 million in aggregate. On July 6, 2018, the Merger Transaction was completed. Based on the closing price of TriCos common stock of $38.41 on July 6, 2018, and based on the conversion of FNBB outstanding common shares to 7,405,277 shares of TCBK common shares, the share consideration value was approximately $284.4 million. The Company also paid cash of $6.7 million to settle and retire all FNBB stock options outstanding as of the acquisition date. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2018, the Company employed 1,174 persons, including six executive officers. Full time equivalent employees were 1,141. No employees of the Company are presently represented by a union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that its employee relations are good. 
Competition 
 The banking business in California generally, and in the Banks primary service area of Northern and Central California specifically, is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits. It is dominated by a relatively small number of national and regional banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area. Among the advantages such major banks have over the Bank is their ability to finance wide ranging advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment assets to regions of high yield and demand. By virtue of their greater total capitalization such institutions have substantially higher lending limits than does the Bank. 
 In addition to competing with other banks, the Bank competes with savings institutions, credit unions and the financial markets for funds. Yields on corporate and government debt securities and other commercial paper may be higher than on deposits, and therefore affect the ability of commercial banks to attract and hold deposits. Commercial banks also compete for available funds with money market instruments and mutual funds. During past periods of high interest rates, money market funds have provided substantial competition to banks for deposits and they may continue to do so in the future. Mutual funds are also a major source of competition for savings dollars. The Bank relies substantially on local promotional activity, personal contacts by its officers, directors, employees and shareholders, extended hours, personalized service and its reputation in the communities it services to compete effectively. 
 Regulation and Supervision 
 General 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state law. This regulation is intended primarily for the protection of customers, depositors, the FDIC deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of shareholders of the Company. Set forth below is a summary description of the significant laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. 
Regulatory Agencies 
 The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. As a bank holding company, the Company is regulated under the BHC Act, and is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the FRB. The Company is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each administered by the SEC. The Companys common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select market (Nasdaq) under the trading symbol TCBK and the Company is, therefore, subject to the rules of Nasdaq for listed companies.

 The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and periodic examination by the FDIC, which is the banks primary federal regulator because the bank is a state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System and the DBO, because the bank is a California state chartered bank. This regulation is broad and extends to all of the Banks operations. 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB) as an independent entity with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services. The CFPBs functions include investigating consumer complaints, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions, including the Bank. Banks with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to examination by the CFPB. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, including the Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with federal consumer laws by their primary federal banking agency. 
 The Bank Holding Company Act 
 The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the BHC Act. In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Qualified bank holding companies that elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or (ii) complementary to a financial activity, and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as determined solely by the FRB). Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and agency, and making merchant banking investments. The Company currently has not elected to become a financial holding company. 
 As a bank holding company, TriCo is required to file reports with the FRB and the FRB periodically examines the Company. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank. 
 The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks. The BHC Act requires a bank holding company to obtain the approval of the FRB prior to directly or indirectly acquiring more than 5 percent of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of an acquiring banks primary federal regulator is required before it may merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the applicants performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act, consumer compliance, fair housing laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. 
 Safety and Soundness Standards 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) implemented certain specific restrictions on transactions and required the regulators to adopt overall safety and soundness standards for depository institutions related to internal control, loan underwriting and documentation, and asset growth. Among other things, FDICIA limits the interest rates paid on deposits by undercapitalized institutions, the use of brokered deposits and the aggregate extension of credit by a depository institution to an executive officer, director, principal stockholder or related interest, and reduces deposit insurance coverage for deposits offered by undercapitalized institutions for deposits by certain employee benefits accounts. 
 Under FDICIA, the federal ban regulatory agencies have establish safety and soundness standards for insured financial institutions covering: 
 

 | Internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Loan documentation;
--+--------------------


 | Credit underwriting;
--+---------------------


 | Interest rate exposure;
--+------------------------


 | Asset growth;
--+--------------

 
4 


 
 | Compensation, fees and benefits;
--+---------------------------------


 | Asset quality, earnings and stock valuation; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | Excessive compensation for executive officers, directors or principal shareholders which could lead to material financial loss.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If an agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard established by the guidelines, the agency may require the financial institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If the agency requires submission of a compliance plan and the institution fails to timely submit an acceptable plan or to implement an accepted plan, the agency must require the institution to correct the deficiency. An institution must file a compliance plan within 30 days of a request to do so from the institutions primary federal regulatory agency. The agencies may elect to initiate enforcement actions in certain cases rather than relying on a plan, particularly where failure to meet one or more of the standards could threaten the safe and sound operation of the institution. 
 Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions 
 A California corporation such as TriCo may make a distribution to its shareholders to the extent that either the corporations retained earnings meet or exceed the amount of the proposed distribution or the value of the corporations assets exceed the amount of its liabilities plus the amount of shareholders preferences, if any, and certain other conditions are met. It is the FRBs policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs and financial condition. In addition, a bank holding company may be unable to pay dividends on its common stock if it fails to maintain an adequate capital conservation buffer under the new capital rules. See Regulatory Capital Requirements. 
 The primary source of funds for payment of dividends by TriCo to its shareholders has been and will be the receipt of dividends and management fees from the Bank. TriCos ability to receive dividends from the Bank is limited by applicable state and federal law. Under the California Financial Code, funds available for cash dividend payments by a bank are restricted to the lesser of: (i) retained earnings or (ii) the banks net income for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to shareholders made during such period). However, with the prior approval of the Commissioner of the DBO, a bank may pay cash dividends in an amount not to exceed the greatest of the: (1) retained earnings of the bank; (2) net income of the bank for its last fiscal year; or (3) net income of the bank for its current fiscal year. However, if the DBO finds that the shareholders equity of the bank is not adequate or that the payment of a dividend would be unsafe or unsound, the Commissioner may order the bank not to pay a dividend to shareholders. 
 The new Capital Rules may restrict dividends by the Bank if the additional capital conservation buffer is not achieved. See Regulatory Capital Requirements. 
 The FRB, FDIC and the DBO have authority to prohibit a bank holding company or a bank from engaging in practices which are considered to be unsafe and unsound. Depending on the financial condition of TriCo and the Bank and other factors, the FRB, FDIC or the DBO could determine that payment of dividends or other payments by TriCo or the Bank might constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. 
 The Community Reinvestment Act 
 The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to periodically assess a banks record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA also requires the agencies to consider a financial institutions record of meeting its community credit when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches and mergers or acquisitions. The federal banking agencies rate depository institutions compliance with the CRA. The ratings range from a high of outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance. A less than satisfactory rating could result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved. As of its most recent CRA examination, the Banks CRA rating was Satisfactory.

 Consumer Protection Laws 
 The Bank is subject to many federal consumer protection statues and regulations, some of which are discussed below. 
 

 | The Equal Credit Opportunity Act generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Truth-in-Lending Act is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Fair Housing Act regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which includes a fair lending aspect, requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the CFPB has taken a number of actions that may affect the Banks operations and compliance costs, including the following: 
 

 | The issuance of final rules for residential mortgage lending, which became effective January 10, 2013, including definitions for qualified mortgages and detailed standards by which lenders must satisfy themselves of the borrowers ability to repay the loan and revised forms of disclosure under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The issuance of a policy report on arbitration clauses which could result in the restriction or prohibition of lenders including arbitration clauses in consumer financial services contracts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Actions taken to regulate and supervise credit bureaus and debt collections.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Positions taken by CFPB on fair lending, including applying the disparate impact theory in auto financing, which could make it harder for lenders, such as the Bank, to charge different rates or apply different terms to loans to different customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Penalties for violations of the above laws may include fines, reimbursements, injunctive relief and other penalties. 
 Data Privacy and Cyber Security Regulation 
 The Company is subject to many U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect the non-public confidential information of customers and employees. The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally prohibit financial institutions, including the Company, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure. Other laws and regulations, at the international, federal and state level, limit the Companys ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information.

 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements of the FRB and FDIC, respectively. Capital requirements may have an effect on the Companys and the Banks profitability and ability to pay dividends. If the Company or the Bank lacks adequate capital to increase its assets without violating the minimum capital requirements or if it forced to reduce the level of its assets in order to satisfy regulatory capital requirements, its ability to generate earnings would be reduced. 
 For a discussion of the regulatory capital requirements, see Note 25  Regulatory Matters to the consolidated financial statements at Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
 We believe that we were in compliance with the requirements of the new capital rules applicable to us as of December 31, 2018. 
 Prompt Corrective Action 
 Prompt Corrective Action regulations of the federal bank regulatory agencies establish five capital categories in descending order (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized), assignment to which depends upon the institutions total risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and leverage ratio. The new capital rules revised the prompt corrective action framework. Under the current prompt corrective action framework, insured depository institutions will be required to meet the following minimum capital level requirements in order to qualify as well capitalized: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 10%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. Institutions classified in one of the three undercapitalized categories are subject to certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions, which include increased monitoring and review, implementation of capital restoration plans, asset growth restrictions, limitations upon expansion and new business activities, requirements to augment capital, restrictions upon deposit gathering and interest rates, replacement of senior executive officers and directors, and requiring divestiture or sale of the institution. The Banks capital levels have exceeded the minimums necessary to be considered well capitalized under the current regulatory framework for prompt corrective action since adoption. 
Deposit Insurance 
 Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments as determined by the FDIC. The amount of the deposit insurance assessment for institutions with less than $10.0 billion in assets, such as the Bank, is based on its risk category, with certain adjustments for any unsecured debt or brokered deposits held by the insured bank. Institutions assigned to higher risk categories (that is, institutions that pose a higher risk of loss to the FDICs deposit insurance fund (the DIF)) pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk. An institutions risk classification is assigned based on a combination of its financial ratios and supervisory ratings, reflecting, among other things, its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern that the institution poses to the regulators. In addition, the FDIC can impose special assessments in certain instances. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act changed the way that deposit insurance premiums are calculated. The assessment base is no longer the institutions deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. The Dodd-Frank Act also increased the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits by 2020, eliminates the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC each year, and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. Continued action by the FDIC to replenish the DIF, as well as the changes contained in the Dodd-Frank Act, may result in higher assessment rates, which could reduce our profitability or otherwise negatively impact our operations. 
 The Bank is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines, the Bank may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on the Companys earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of, or market for, the Companys common stock. 
 The FDIC may terminate a depository institutions deposit insurance upon a finding that the institutions financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the banks depositors. The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would also result in the revocation of the Banks charter by the DBO.

 Anti-Money Laundering Laws 
 A series of banking laws and regulations beginning with the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970 requires banks to prevent, detect, and report illicit or illegal financial activities to the federal government to prevent money laundering, international drug trafficking, and terrorism. Today, the Bank Secrecy Act requires that all banking institutions develop and provide for the continued administration of a program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements regarding both domestic and international currency transactions. These programs must, at a minimum, provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance, provide for independent testing of such systems and compliance, designate individuals responsible for such compliance and provide appropriate personnel training. 
 Under the USA Patriot Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, requirements regarding the Customer Identification Program, as well as enhanced due diligence and know your customer standards in their dealings with high risk customers, foreign financial institutions, and foreign individuals and entities. The act also requires financial institutions, including banks, to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements, meet minimum standards specified by the act, follow minimum standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and regularly compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations and money launderers. 
 Transactions with Affiliates 
 Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders (including the Company) or any related interest of such persons. Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, including its holding company, be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies. 
Impact of Monetary Policies 
 Banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials. In general, the difference between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rate earned by banks on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets comprises the major source of banks earnings. Thus, the earnings and growth of banks are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the FRB. The FRB implements national monetary policy, such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession, by its open-market dealings in United States government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements and through adjustments to the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks which are members of the FRB. The actions of the FRB in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates. The nature and timing of any future changes in such policies and their impact on the Company cannot be predicted. In addition, adverse economic conditions could make a higher provision for loan losses a prudent course and could cause higher loan loss charge-offs, thus adversely affecting the Companys net earnings.
