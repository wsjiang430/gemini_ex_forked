Business Overview
Grid Dynamics is an emerging leader in enterprise-level digital transformations in Fortune 1000 companies. For enterprises that create innovative digital products and experiences, Grid Dynamics offers close collaboration to provide digital transformation initiatives that span strategy consulting, development of early prototypes and enterprise-scale delivery of new digital platforms. Since its inception in 2006 in Menlo Park, California, as a grid and cloud consultancy firm, Grid Dynamics has been on the forefront of digital transformation. Our specialty is working on big ideas like cloud migrations, DevOps, microservices, big data and artificial intelligence (“AI”). Grid Dynamics quickly established itself as a provider of choice for technology and digital enterprise companies.
As a leading global digital engineering and information technology (“IT”) services provider with its headquarters in Silicon Valley and engineering centers in the United States, Mexico, India and multiple European countries, Grid Dynamics’ core business is to deliver focused and complex technical consulting, software design, development, testing and internet service operations. Grid Dynamics also helps organizations become more agile and create innovative digital products and experiences through its deep expertise in emerging technology, such as AI, data science, cloud computing, big data and DevOps, lean software development practices and a high-performance product culture.
Grid Dynamics believes that the key to its success is a business culture that puts products over projects, client success over contract terms and real business results over pure technical innovation. By leveraging Grid Dynamics’ proprietary processes optimized for innovation, emphasis on talent development and technical expertise, Grid Dynamics has been able to achieve significant growth. During the last three years Grid Dynamics acquired Daxx Web Industries B.V. (“Daxx”), Tacit Knowledge Inc. (“Tacit”) and Mutual Mobile Inc. (“Mutual Mobile”), respectively. These acquisitions diversified our geographical presence, client base, and industry vertical presence. 
Industry Background and Market Opportunity
Digital transformation is a rapidly expanding market which is still in its early stages. Enterprises strive to compete in the digital world, facing the need to transform to survive attacks from the nimbler and more technologically advanced newcomers. Traditional approaches to managing information technology as a mix of vendor solutions and outsourced services often break down in the face of the imperative to innovate through technology.
Increasingly, business executives are looking at use of technology as a competitive advantage rather than a way to cut costs. The rise of AI signifies a shift from automation of business process to automation of decision making itself. In an effort to differentiate, corporations are directing investments towards building digital new products and experiences, instead of buying off-the-shelf software products. This drives demand for highly technical software development, creating an opportunity for pure-play software development service providers such as Grid Dynamics.
As the demand for technical software development talent continues to grow, the shortage of this talent in the United States and Europe, as well as the inability of non-technology-based companies to attract and retain such talent, encourages organizations to look to third parties, such as Grid Dynamics, to satisfy the demand.
Further, the growing acceptance of the offshore delivery model, has created significant opportunities for software development service providers delivering from Central and Eastern Europe (“CEE”) as well as Mexico. CEE-based service providers now compete against the largest global IT service providers and are capable of providing complex technology services. Grid Dynamics believes that CEE is increasingly known for the quality of its software development talent, enabled in part by 
decades of focus on fundamental STEM disciplines in higher education. CEE-based teams and individuals are frequent winners of programming contests such as the ones held by the Association for Computing Machinery, or ACM, TopCoder and Kaggle.
Grid Dynamics believes that this disparity between the supply and demand for technical talent can be a significant opportunity for Grid Dynamics.
Strategies and Strengths
Grid Dynamics’ objective is to become a global leader in enabling digital transformation at Fortune 1000 companies. Grid Dynamics’ strategy to achieve such objective is based on leveraging the following core strengths.
Proprietary Processes Optimized for Innovation
Grid Dynamics recognizes the changing dynamics of IT outsourcing. Increasingly, corporations expect their service providers to participate and help shape innovation programs, which are not addressed well by the traditional service models used by outsourcing providers. Grid Dynamics melds technical consulting, engineering and analytics competencies into unified, cross-functional digital teams which are designed to respond and adapt to the change in the client’s business. The effectiveness of such teams is further increased by a close collaboration with the client’s technology leadership teams and active inquiry into client’s business priorities on all levels.
Culture-First Approach to Talent Development
The ever-increasing role of digital transformation leads to the emergence of a new kind of business leader that combines a vision of business transformation with deep understanding of information technology. Earning the trust of these leaders is one of the pillars of Grid Dynamics’ success. Grid Dynamics selects, trains and promotes its technical leadership based on the following cultural principles.
•Global integration. Demands of modern businesses transcend cultural, political and language boundaries. Grid Dynamics builds teams which are transparently distributed across countries, time zones and reporting lines. Decisions on hiring, staffing and promotion are all managed centrally from Grid Dynamics’ U.S. offices, allowing Grid Dynamics to optimize for quality rather than convenience.
•Partnership with client. Grid Dynamics demands accountability and ownership of the client’s success, whether or not such success is a contractual matter. Understanding Grid Dynamics clients’ goals and ability to manage such goals across reporting lines is a must for any leadership role within Grid Dynamics. 
•Technological innovation. Understanding digital transformation and successfully delivering IT programs is impossible without a strong understanding of emerging technology. Deep knowledge of how new technology, such as cloud, big data and AI, transforms the way corporations develop their businesses is a pre-requisite for leadership roles in Grid Dynamics.
•Education. Grid Dynamics believes that technology changes rapidly, and it is critical for Grid Dynamics' employees to adapt even more rapidly. Grid Dynamics offers many formal and informal training programs, such as Grid University, an online education platform with thousands of hours of training videos, to ensure that professionals can expand and enhance their capabilities.
Technical Expertise and Scalable Engineering
Grid Dynamics believes in strong infrastructure underpinning mission-critical services. From its inception, Grid Dynamics has been focusing on developing and using its expertise in the latest technologies, such as AI and conversational systems, cloud engineering solutions, data platform, data science and analytical data platforms, DevOps, MLOps, microservices, mobile, QA automation, search and user interfaces. By making such emerging technologies accessible to clients through the use of proprietary skill development programs, industry experience and solution accelerators, Grid Dynamics seeks to strengthen its position as a technical leader with its established clients and attract new clients.
Services and Solutions
In the rapidly evolving market of engineering and IT services, customers are increasingly looking for service providers that can be a co-innovation partner rather than a cost saving measure. Grid Dynamics addresses this need by focusing on high value, high impact services. The key service and solutions offerings are the following:

Self-sufficient teams move quickly, use the latest technologies and aim to solve the business use case to demonstrate measurable value to the business stakeholders.
Digital Intelligence
Grid Dynamics helps corporations transform from automation of business processes to automation of decision making. To this end, Grid Dynamics deploys data science approaches to analyze client challenges and arrive at a strategy which produces measurable outcomes. This continuous “analyze-assess-decide-measure” cycle becomes the foundation of AI programs, leveraging the latest technologies to constantly react to real-time changes in consumer behavior.
