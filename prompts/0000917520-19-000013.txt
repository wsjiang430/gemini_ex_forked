ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW 
The terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Company” and “Integra” refer to Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries, unless the context suggests otherwise. 
Integra, headquartered in Plainsboro, New Jersey, is a world leader in medical technology. The Company was founded in 1989 with the acquisition of an engineered collagen technology platform used to repair and regenerate tissue. Since then, Integra has developed numerous product lines from this technology for applications ranging from burn and deep tissue wounds, to the repair of dura mater in the brain, and the repair of nerves and tendons. The Company has expanded its base regenerative technology business to include surgical instruments, neurosurgical products, advanced wound care, and orthopedic hardware through a combination of several global acquisitions and by developing products internally to further meet the needs of its customers.
Integra employs approximately 4,500 people dedicated to limiting uncertainty for surgeons, so that they can concentrate on providing the best care for their patients. Integra provides innovative healthcare solutions in more than 130 countries through its nearly 50 offices and its worldwide distribution network.
VISION
We aspire to be a worldwide leader in neurosurgery & reconstructive surgery, with a portfolio of leading businesses that delivers outstanding customer experience through innovation, execution and teamwork to positively impact the lives of millions of patients and families. 
STRATEGY 
Integra is committed to delivering high quality products that positively impact the lives of millions of patients and their families. We focus on four key pillars: 1) building an execution-focused culture, 2) achieving relevant scale, 3) improving agility and innovation, and 4) leading in customer excellence. We believe that by sharpening our focus on these areas through improved planning and communication, optimization of our infrastructure, and strategically aligned tuck-in acquisitions, we can build scale, increase competitiveness and achieve our long-term goals.
To this end, our executive leadership team has established the following key priorities aligned to this strategy:
Strategic Acquisitions. An important part of our strategy is pursuing strategic transactions and licensing agreements that increase relevant scale in the clinical areas in which we compete. In 2018, integrating the Codman Neurosurgery business, which was acquired from Johnson and Johnson in the previous year, remained a top priority and we will continue to transition the business throughout 2019. This acquisition expanded our portfolio of neurosurgery products and established us as the world leader in neurosurgery. It has also enabled us to bring our entire Integra portfolio to a global market. 
Portfolio Optimization and New Product Introductions. We are investing in innovative product development to drive a multi-generational pipeline for our key product franchises. Our product development efforts focus on regenerative technologies and other projects with the potential for significant returns on investment. In 2018, we achieved significant milestones in research and development by successfully launching nine new products. In addition to new product development, we are funding studies to gather clinical evidence to support launches, ensure market access and improve reimbursement for existing products. We also continue to identify low-growth, low-margin products and product franchises for discontinuation and will continue to look at other ways of optimizing our portfolio.
Commercial Channel Investments. With acquisitions, new product introductions and a broader portfolio of products, investing in our sales channels is a core part of our strategy to create specialization and greater focus on reaching our customers and addressing their needs. Internationally, we have increased our commercial resources significantly in almost all markets and are making investments to support our sales organization and maximize our commercial opportunities. We now have a strong international sales channel that will deliver our current portfolio as well as position us for expansion. In addition, we continue to build upon our leadership brands across our product franchises to enable us to engage hospital systems through enterprise-wide contracts.
Customer Excellence. We aspire to be ranked as a best-in-class provider and are committed to strengthening our relationships with all of our customers. We strive to consistently deliver outstanding customer service and continue to invest in technologies, systems and processes to improve the way our customers do business with us. Additionally, we expect to build on the success of our professional education programs to drive continued customer appreciation of our growing portfolio of medical technologies globally.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We currently manufacture and sell our products in the following two global reportable business segments: Codman Specialty Surgical and Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies. We include financial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information under "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Note 16, Segment and Geographic Information to our consolidated financial statements.
Codman Specialty Surgical
Our Codman Specialty Surgical business offers global, neurosurgery market-leading technologies, brands and instrumentation. The product portfolio represents a continuum of care from pre-operative, to the neurosurgery operating room, to the neuro-critical care unit and post care for both adult and pediatric patients suffering from brain tumors, brain injury, cerebrospinal fluid pressure complications and other neurological conditions.
The acquisition of Codman Neurosurgery from Johnson & Johnson increased our global direct sales representation and commercial presence. This acquisition expanded the product portfolio of our well known, leading technologies in dural repair, ultrasonic tissue ablation, intracranial pressure ("ICP") monitoring, hydrocephalus management, and cranial stabilization systems, while providing a rich research and development pipeline for growth.
Rounding out the portfolio is a catalog of surgical headlamps, surgical instrumentation, as well as asset management software and support, and after-market service. With thousands of surgical instrument products, including specialty surgical instruments, we call on the central sterile processing unit of hospitals and acute care surgical centers. Additionally, through a strong U.S. distribution model, we can serve the needs of hundreds of physicians, dental and veterinary offices.
Our global commercial network includes clinical specialists, a large direct global sales force and strategic partnerships and distributors that serve hospitals, integrated health networks, group purchasing organizations, clinicians, surgery centers and health care providers.
Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies
Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies products serve some of the fastest growing markets in the medical technology industry and provide solutions that primarily address the needs of orthopedic, plastic, reconstructive and general surgeons. These products focus on addressing soft tissue, nerve, and tendon repairs as well as reconstruction in the hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, ankle and foot.
We provide regenerative technology solutions for the treatment of acute wounds, such as burns, chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, surgical tissue repair including hernia repair, peripheral nerve repair and protection, and tendon repair. For extremity bone and joint reconstruction procedures, we sell hardware products, such as bone and joint fixation and joint replacement devices, implants and instruments, which provide for the reconstruction of bone in the hand, wrist, elbow and shoulder (Upper Extremity), and the foot, ankle and leg below the knee (Lower Extremity). In addition, we created opportunities to further expand our presence in the plastic and reconstructive surgery segments with our advanced wound care products such as Medihoney®, weight offloading, and amniotic tissue.
We made significant investments over the last two years with our channel expansion in the U.S. and created four dedicated sales channels to have more focus and specialization within our call points to drive sustainable growth. We have a specialized sales organization composed of directly employed sales representatives, as well as specialty distributors, organized based upon their call point. Our extremity orthopedics sales representatives call on surgeons who treat extremity orthopedic disorders, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, wrist, ankle and shoulder arthroplasty, and other conditions requiring foot or hand reconstruction. Additionally, we sell our shoulder products through a specialty distributor network of sales agents who call on shoulder surgeons. Our wound reconstruction acute (inpatient) sales representatives call on surgeons doing procedures in limb salvage, trauma, wound reconstruction and burns, while our advanced wound care sales representatives call on physicians who treat chronic wounds in the outpatient wound care clinic setting. We also have a dedicated surgical reconstruction sales team focused on plastic and reconstructive surgery and hernia procedures with differentiated products. Finally, we have a distributor network focused on biologics.
Outside the U.S., we have a small direct sales presence, primarily in certain European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, and use distributors in other international markets to sell certain product lines.
This business segment also includes private-label sales of a broad set of our regenerative and wound care technologies. Our customers are other medical technology companies that sell to end markets primarily in orthopedics, spine, surgical and wound care.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY 
Our research and development activities focus on identifying unmet surgical needs and addressing those needs with innovative solutions and products. We apply our core competency in regenerative technology to products for neurosurgical, orthopedic and wound applications, and we have extensive programs for our core platforms of orthopedic hardware and electromechanical technologies. We are focusing our research and development efforts on products and clinical studies to generate efficacy and health economic evidence.
Regenerative Technologies. Integra was the first and only company to receive a United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") claim for regeneration of dermal tissue and is a world leader in regenerative technology. Because regenerative technology products represent a fast-growing, high-margin opportunity for us, we allocate a large portion of our research and development budget to these projects. Our regenerative technology development program applies our expertise in bioengineering to a range of biomaterials including natural collagen and human tissues as well as synthetics such as polymers. These unique product designs are used for neurosurgical and orthopedic surgical applications, as well as dermal regeneration, including the healing of chronic and acute wounds, tendon and nerve repair. Our regenerative technology platform includes our legacy Integra® Dermal Regeneration Template (IDRT) products and complementary technologies that we have acquired over the last few years. Our collagen manufacturing capability, combined with our history of innovation, provides us with strong platform technologies for multiple indications. In 2017 and 2018, we introduced ten new regenerative technology products, including SurgiMend MP to address Abdominal Hernias, SurgiMend PRS for plastic and reconstructive surgery, AmnioExcel Plus and new sizes of PriMatrix® and Omnigraft for treatment of wounds. 
Orthopedic Reconstruction. We develop fixation and small joint reconstruction implants and instruments for upper and lower extremities to both provide next generation solutions and expand our product portfolio. This portfolio focuses on joint replacement products. Integra has a strong shoulder portfolio, which includes a total shoulder system and a reverse shoulder. We continue to work on advanced shoulder products and are developing next generation anatomical designs, bone preserving products and techniques, and a pyrocarbon shoulder hemiarthroplasty product to add to that portfolio. We have a strong differentiated asset that resides in our patented pyrocarbon products, and we continue to invest to bring new products to market with this technology, which has shown significantly less wear on bone than traditional metals. To expand our ankle offering, we launched the Integra® XT Ankle Revision System which may be used to revise most ankle prosthesis currently in the market. The non-randomized, prospective, multi-center post-market studies we launched in 2017 in the U.S., Europe and Canada to evaluate 2-year implant survivorship in subjects who received the Cadence® Total Ankle System for primary ankle arthroplasty is progressing and will further evaluate implant survivorship at 5 and 10 years post-operatively.
Electromechanical Technologies and Instrumentation. Because our electromechanical products and instruments address significant needs in surgical procedures and limit uncertainty for surgeons, we continue to invest in approvals for new indications and next generation improvements to our market-leading products. We have several active programs focused on life cycle management and innovation, for capital and disposable products in our portfolio. Our product development efforts are focused on core clinical applications in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) management, neuro-critical care (NCC) monitoring, minimally invasive instruments and electrosurgery and ultrasonic medical technologies. We also work with several instrument partners to bring new surgical instrument patterns to the market, enabling us to add new instruments with minimal expense. Finally, our lighting franchise is among the most dynamic in the industry, and we continue to invest in ongoing development in LED technology.
COMPETITION 
Our competitors for Codman Specialty Surgical are the Aesculap division of B. Braun Medical, Inc., Medtronic, Inc., Stryker Corporation and Becton Dickinson and Company. In addition, we compete with many smaller specialized companies and larger companies that do not otherwise focus on the offerings that Codman Specialty Surgical technologies does. We rely on the depth and breadth of our sales and marketing organization, our innovative technology, and our procurement and manufacturing operations to maintain our competitive position. 
Our competition in Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies includes the DePuy/Synthes business of Johnson & Johnson, ACell, Inc., Stryker Corporation, Wright Medical Group, N.V., Smith & Nephew plc, MiMedx Group, Inc., LifeCell Corporation, a subsidiary of Allergan PLC, and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., as well as other major orthopedic companies that carry a full line of small bone and joint fixation and soft tissue products. 
Finally, in certain cases our products compete primarily against medical practices that treat a condition without using a medical device or any particular product, such as medical practices that utilize autograft tissue instead of our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products and nerve repair products. Depending on the product line, we compete based on our products' features, strength of our sales force or distributors, sophistication of our technology and cost effectiveness of our solution.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We are a manufacturer and marketer of medical devices, and therefore are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the Center for Medicare Services of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, other federal governmental agencies and, in some jurisdictions, by state and foreign governmental authorities. These regulations govern the introduction of new medical devices, the observance of certain standards with respect to the design, manufacture, testing, labeling, promotion and sales of the devices, the maintenance of certain records, the ability to track devices, the reporting of potential product defects, the import and export of devices, and other matters. 
United States Food and Drug Administration
The regulatory process for obtaining product approvals and clearances can be onerous and costly. The FDA requires, as a condition to marketing a medical device in the U.S., that we secure a Premarket Notification clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”) or an approved PMA application (or supplemental PMA application). Obtaining these approvals and clearances can take up to several years and may involve preclinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA also may require a post-approval clinical study as a condition of approval. To perform clinical trials for significant risk devices in the U.S. on an unapproved product, we are required to obtain an Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") from the FDA. The FDA may also require a filing for approval prior to marketing products that are modifications of existing products or new indications for existing products. Moreover, after clearance/approval is given, if the product is shown to be hazardous or defective, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have the power to withdraw the clearance or approval, as the case may be, or require us to change the device, its manufacturing process or its labeling, to supply additional proof of its safety and effectiveness or to recall, repair, replace or refund the cost of the medical device. Because we currently export medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that have not been approved by the FDA for distribution in the U.S., we are required to obtain approval/registration in the country to which we are exporting and maintain certain records relating to exports and make these available to the FDA for inspection, if required. 
Human Cells, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products 
Integra, through the acquisition of Derma Sciences and BioD LLC ("BioD") is involved with the recovery, processing, storage, transportation and distribution of donated amniotic tissue. The FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing, or consisting of, human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient. Examples include bone, ligament, skin and cornea. 
Some HCT/Ps fall within the definition of a biological product, medical device or drug regulated under the FD&C Act. These biologic, device or drug HCT/Ps must comply both with the requirements exclusively applicable to HCT/Ps and, in addition, with requirements applicable to biologics, devices or drugs, including premarket clearance or approval from the FDA. 
Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (“Section 361”), authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as “361” HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, and Good Tissue Practice when processing, storing, labeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting. 
The American Association of Tissue Banks (“AATB”) has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Compliance with these standards is a requirement in order to become an AATB-accredited tissue establishment. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations. We are licensed or have permits for tissue banking in California, Florida, New York and Maryland. 
National Organ Transplant Act. Procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant Act, which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. Our subsidiary, BioD LLC is a registered Tissue Bank and is involved with the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human amniotic tissue.
Amniotic tissue is considered an HCT/P. However, on June 22, 2015, the FDA issued an Untitled Letter alleging that BioD’s morselized amniotic membrane tissue-based products do not meet the criteria for regulation as HCT/Ps solely under Section 361 and that, as a result, BioD would need a biologics license to lawfully market those morselized products. Since the issuance of the Untitled Letter, BioD and more recently the Company have been in discussions with the FDA to communicate their disagreement with the FDA’s assertion that certain products are more than minimally manipulated. The FDA has not changed its position that certain of the BioD acquired products are not eligible for marketing solely under Section 361. In November 2017, the FDA issued the final guidance document related to human tissue titled, “Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use” (the “HCT/P Final Guidance”). The HCT/P Final Guidance maintains the FDA’s position that products such as the Company’s morselized amniotic membrane tissue-based products do not meet the criteria for regulation solely as HCT/Ps. In addition, the FDA articulated a risk-based approach to enforcement and, while some uses for amniotic membrane tissue-based products would enjoy as much as thirty-six months of enforcement discretion, other high-risk uses could be subject to immediate enforcement action. The Company does not believe the uses for its 
7

amniotic membrane tissue-based products fall into the high risk category. As of February 26, 2019, the Company has not received any further notice of enforcement action from the FDA regarding its morselized amniotic tissue-based products. Revenues from BioD morselized amniotic membrane-based products for the year ended December 31, 2018 were less than 1.0% of consolidated revenues. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Certain of our products are derived from human tissue and are subject to additional regulations and requirements.”
Medical Device Regulations
We also are required to register with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. As such, our manufacturing sites are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulations. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, we are required to comply with various FDA requirements and other legal requirements for labeling and promotion. If the FDA believes that a company is not in compliance with applicable regulations, it may issue a warning letter, institute proceedings to detain or seize products, issue a recall order, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against that company, its officers or its employees and may recommend criminal prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Medical device regulations also are in effect in many of the countries in which we do business outside the U.S. These laws range from comprehensive medical device approval and Quality System requirements for some or all of our medical device products to simpler requests for product data or certifications. Under the European Union Medical Device Directive, medical devices must meet the Medical Device Directive standards and receive CE Mark Certification prior to marketing in the European Union (the “EU”). In addition, the EU enacted the EU Medical Device Regulation, which imposes stricter requirements on the marketing and sales of medical devices which includes but is not limited to quality systems and labeling. CE Mark Certification requires a comprehensive quality system program, technical documentation, clinical evaluation and data on the product, which are then reviewed by a Notified Body. A Notified Body is an organization designated by the national governments of the EU member states to make independent judgments about whether a product complies with the requirements established by each CE marking directive. The Medical Device Directive, Medical Device Regulation, ISO 9000 series and ISO 13485 are recognized international quality standards that are designed to ensure that we develop and manufacture quality medical devices. Other countries are also instituting regulations regarding medical devices or interpreting and enforcing existing regulations more strictly. Compliance with these regulations requires extensive documentation and clinical reports for all of our products, revisions to labeling, and other requirements such as facility inspections to comply with the registration requirements. A recognized Notified Body audits our facilities annually to verify our compliance with the ISO 13485 Quality System standard. 
Certain countries, as well as the EU, have issued regulations that govern products that contain materials derived from animal sources. Regulatory authorities are particularly concerned with materials infected with the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE”), otherwise known as mad cow disease. These regulations affect our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products, hernia repair products, biomaterial products for the spine, nerve and tendon repair products and certain other products, all of which contain material derived from bovine tissue. Although we take great care to provide that our products are safe and free of agents that can cause disease, products that contain materials derived from animals, including our products, may become subject to additional regulation, or even be banned in certain countries, because of concern over the potential for prion transmission. Significant new regulations, a ban of our products, or a movement away from bovine-derived products because of an outbreak of BSE could have a material, adverse effect on our current business or our ability to expand our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Certain of our products contain materials derived from animal sources and may become subject to additional regulation.” 
Postmarket Requirements. After a device is cleared or approved for commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include the FDA Quality System Regulations which cover the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of medical devices; the FDA's general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or 'off-label' uses; the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which require manufacturers to report recalls and field corrective actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act. 
Other regulations
Anti-Bribery Laws. In the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws that regulate the means by which companies in the health care industry may market their products to hospitals and health care professionals and may compete by discounting the prices of their products. Similar anti-bribery laws exist in many of the countries in which we sell our products outside the U.S., as well as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (which addresses the activities of U.S. companies in foreign markets). Our products also are subject to regulation regarding reimbursement, and U.S. healthcare laws apply when a customer submits a claim for a product that is 
8

reimbursed under a federally funded healthcare program. These global laws require that we exercise care in designing our sales and marketing practices, including involving interactions with healthcare professionals, and customer discount arrangements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Oversight of the medical device industry might affect the manner in which we may sell medical devices and compete in the marketplace.” 
 Import-export. Our international operations subject us to laws regarding sanctioned countries, entities and persons, customs, and import-export. Among other things, these laws restrict, and in some cases can prevent, U.S. companies from directly or indirectly selling goods, technology or services to people or entities in certain countries. In addition, these laws require that we exercise care in our business dealings with entities in and from foreign countries. 
Hazardous materials. Our research, development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials. We are subject to country-specific, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products. We believe that our environmental, health and safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by the controlling laws and regulations. However, risk of accidental releases or injury from these materials is possible. These risks are managed to minimize or eliminate associated business impacts. In the event of this type of accident, we could be held liable for damages that may result, and any liability could exceed our resources. We could be subject to a regulatory shutdown of a facility that could prevent the distribution and sale of products manufactured there for a significant period of time, and we could suffer a casualty loss that could require a shutdown of the facility in order to repair it, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business. Although we continuously strive to maintain full compliance with respect to all applicable global environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could incur substantial costs to fully comply with future laws and regulations, and our operations, business or assets may be negatively affected. Furthermore, global environmental, health and safety compliance is an ongoing process. Integra has compliance procedures in place for compliance with Employee Health & Safety laws, driven by a centrally led organizational structure that ensures proper implementation, which is essential to our overall business objectives. 
In addition to the above regulations, we are, and may be, subject to regulation under country-specific federal and state laws, including, but not limited to, requirements regarding record keeping, and the maintenance of personal information, including personal health information. As a public company, we are subject to the securities laws and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We also are subject to other present and could be subject to possible future, local, state, federal and foreign regulations. 
Third-Party Reimbursement. Healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third-party payors, including, in the U.S., the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payors, such as indemnity insurers, employer group health insurance programs and managed care plans, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the products. As a result, demand for our products is and will continue to be dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors. The manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type of payor involved and the setting in which the product is furnished and utilized. Reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may be subject to periodic adjustments as a result of legislative, regulatory and policy changes, as well as budgetary pressures. Possible reductions in, or eliminations of, coverage or reimbursement by third-party payors, or denial of, or provision of uneconomical reimbursement for new products may affect our customers' revenue and ability to purchase our products. Any changes in the healthcare regulatory, payment or enforcement landscape relative to our customers' healthcare services have the potential to significantly affect our operations and revenue. 
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Laws and Regulations. As a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity (relating to the confidentiality and security of our information technology systems, products such as medical devices, and other services provided by us) may result in increased costs, lower revenue, new complexities in compliance, new challenges for competition, and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, financial information, intellectual property, and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce.
For example, in the U.S. the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the U.S. federal and state, and industry levels. U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers. In addition, the FDA has issued guidance advising manufacturers to take cybersecurity risks into account in product design for connected medical devices and systems, to assure that appropriate safeguards are in place to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or modification to medical devices that contain software and reduce the risk of introducing threats into hospital systems that are connected to such devices. The FDA also issued guidance on post market management of cyber security in medical devices.
Outside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and, potentially, intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. In Europe, 
9

for example, we are subject to the EU data protection regulations, including the current EU Directive on Data Protection, which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection, use and transfer of personal data. A new EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") which became enforceable in May 2018 includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the EU to comply with EU privacy and data protection rules.
These laws and regulations impact the ways in which we use and manage personal data, protected health information, and our information technology systems. They also impact our ability to move, store, and access data across geographic boundaries. Compliance with these requirements may require changes in business practices, complicate our operations, and add complexity and additional management and oversight needs. They also may complicate our clinical research activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
We seek patent and trademark protection for our key technology, products and product improvements, both in the U.S. and in selected foreign countries. When determined appropriate, we have enforced and plan to continue to enforce and defend our patent and trademark rights. In general, however, we do not rely solely on our patent and trademark estate to provide us with any significant competitive advantages as it relates to our existing product lines. We also rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position. In an effort to protect our trade secrets, we have a policy of requiring our employees, consultants and advisors to execute proprietary information and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements also provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of their relationship with us must be kept confidential, except in specified circumstances.

MAYFIELD® is a registered trademark of SM USA, Inc., and is used by Integra under license.
EMPLOYEES 
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,500 employees engaged in production and production support for warehouse, engineering and facilities, quality assurance, quality control, research and development, regulatory and clinical affairs, sales, marketing, administration and finance. Except for certain employees at our facilities in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy and Mexico, none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS 
Financial information about our geographical areas is set forth under “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Geographic Product Revenues and Operations” and in our financial statements Note 16, Segment and Geographic Information, to our consolidated financial statements. 
SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS 
In general, raw materials essential to our businesses are readily available from multiple sources. For reasons of quality assurance, availability, or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. Our policy is to maintain sufficient inventory of components so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time. 
Certain of our products, including our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products, wound care products, bone void fillers, nerve and tendon repair products and certain other products, contain material derived from bovine tissue. We take great care to provide that our products are safe and free of agents that can cause disease. In particular, the collagen used in the products that Integra manufactures is derived either from the deep flexor tendon of cattle less than 24 months old from New Zealand, a country that has never had a reported case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or from the U.S. or from fetal bovine dermis. The World Health Organization classifies different types of cattle tissue for relative risk of BSE transmission. Deep flexor tendon and fetal bovine skin are in the lowest-risk category for BSE transmission, and is therefore considered to have a negligible risk of containing the agent that causes BSE. 
10

SEASONALITY 
Revenues during our fourth quarter tend to be stronger than other quarters because many hospitals increase their purchases of our products during the fourth quarter to coincide with the end of their budget cycles in the U.S. In general, our first quarter usually has lower revenues than the preceding fourth quarter, the second and third quarters have higher revenues than the first quarter, and the fourth quarter revenues are the highest in the year. The main exceptions to this pattern occur because of material intervening acquisitions.
AVAILABLE INFORMATION 
We are subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”).
