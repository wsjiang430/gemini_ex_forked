Item 1. Business 
Our Company
We are a global private markets investment solutions provider with approximately $61 billion of assets under management (“AUM”), and approximately $422 billion of assets under advisement (“AUA”). We work with our clients to conceive, structure, build out, manage and monitor portfolios of private markets funds and direct investments, and we help them access a diversified set of such investment opportunities worldwide. Our clients are principally large, sophisticated, global investors that rely on our private markets expertise, deep industry relationships, differentiated investment access, risk management capabilities, proprietary data advantages and analytical tools to navigate the increasing complexity and opacity of private markets investing. While some maintain their own internal investment teams, our clients look to us for additional expertise, advice and outsourcing capabilities. We were founded in 1991 and have been dedicated to private markets investing for almost three decades. We currently have approximately 370 employees, including 115 investment professionals, operating throughout the United States and in London, Hong Kong, Munich, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, Sydney, Tel Aviv, Tokyo and Toronto. A significant majority of our employees have equity interests in our Company. 
We offer a variety of investment solutions to address our clients’ needs across a range of private markets, including private equity, private credit, real estate, infrastructure, natural resources, growth equity and venture capital. These solutions are constructed from a range of investment types, including primary investments in funds managed by third-party managers, direct/co-investments alongside such funds and acquisitions of secondary stakes in such funds, with a number of our clients utilizing multiple investment types. These solutions are offered in a variety of formats covering some or all phases of private markets investment programs:

• | Customized Separate Accounts: We design and build customized portfolios of private markets funds and direct investments to meet our clients’ specific portfolio objectives with regard to return, risk tolerance, diversification and liquidity. We generally have discretionary investment authority over our customized separate accounts, which comprised approximately $50 billion of our AUM as of March 31, 2019.


• | Specialized Funds: We organize, invest and manage specialized primary, secondary and direct/co-investment funds. Our specialized funds invest across a variety of private markets and include equity, equity-linked and credit funds offered on standard terms as well as shorter duration, opportunistically oriented funds. We launched our first specialized fund in 1997, and our product offerings have grown steadily, comprising approximately $11 billion of our AUM as of March 31, 2019.


• | Advisory Services: We offer investment advisory services to assist clients in developing and implementing their private markets investment programs. Our investment advisory services include asset allocation, strategic plan creation, development of investment policies and guidelines, the screening and recommending of investments, legal negotiations, the monitoring of and reporting on investments and investment manager review and due diligence. Our advisory clients include some of the largest and most sophisticated private markets investors in the world. We had approximately $422 billion of AUA as of March 31, 2019.

• | Distribution Management: We offer distribution management services to our clients through active portfolio management to enhance the realized value of publicly traded stock they receive as distributions from private equity funds.


• | Reporting, Monitoring, Data and Analytics: We provide our clients with comprehensive reporting and investment monitoring services, usually bundled into our broader investment solutions offerings, but occasionally on a stand-alone, fee-for-service basis. Private markets investments are unusually difficult to monitor, report on and administer, and our clients are able to benefit from our sophisticated infrastructure, which provides real-time access to reliable and transparent investment data, and our high-touch service approach, which allows for timely and informed responses to the multiplicity of issues that can arise. We also provide comprehensive research and analytical services as part of our investment solutions, leveraging our large, global, proprietary and high-quality database of private markets investment performance and our suite of proprietary analytical investment tools.

Our client and investor base included over 450 institutions and intermediaries as of March 31, 2019, and is broadly diversified by type, size and geography. Our client base primarily comprises institutional investors that range from those seeking to make an initial investment in alternative assets to some of the world’s largest and most sophisticated private markets investors. As a highly customized, flexible outsourcing partner, we are equipped to provide investment services to institutional clients of all sizes and with different needs, internal resources and investment objectives. Our clients include prominent institutional investors in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and Latin America. We provide private markets solutions and services to some of the largest global pension, sovereign wealth, and U.S. state pension funds. In addition, we believe we are a leading provider of private markets solutions for U.S. labor union pension plans, and we serve numerous smaller public and corporate pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, financial institutions and insurance companies, endowments and foundations, as well as family offices and selected high-net-worth individuals.
Our intermediary clients enable us to provide our investment products to an expanded range of high-net-worth individuals and families. We have a diversified revenue stream from a variety of client types in multiple geographic regions, with no single client representing more than 5% of management and advisory fee revenues. For the year ended March 31, 2019, our top 10 clients generated approximately 23% of management and advisory fee revenues, and our top 20 clients generated approximately 34% of management and advisory fee revenues with all of our top 20 clients having multiple allocations, products or services with us. A significant portion of our revenue base is recurring and is based on the long-term nature of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts as well as long-term relationships with many of our clients, providing highly predictable cash flows. 
Since our inception, we have experienced consistent, strong growth, which continues to be reflected in our more recent AUM and AUA growth. As of March 31, 2019, we had AUM of approximately $61 billion, reflecting a 17% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from March 31, 2015, and our AUM increased in each fiscal year during this timeframe. We had approximately $422 billion of AUA as of March 31, 2019, reflecting a 22% CAGR from March 31, 2015, and our AUA increased in each fiscal year during this timeframe. 
Finally, we believe that our strong culture is a key factor driving our success in developing and maintaining high quality relationships with clients, prospects, other business partners and current/potential employees. We are proud that this culture has been recognized by several prominent trade organizations and publications through numerous awards. For example, we were one of a select group of companies named as a “Best Place to Work in Money Management” in 2018 by Pensions & Investments. 
5

Our firm is the only firm in the “Alternatives Manager” category that has appeared on this list every year since Pensions & Investments initiated this category in 2012. Additionally, the firm has received accolades from publications and organizations including Inc. (Hire Power Award: 2013; Fastest-Growing Private Companies in America: 2012 and 2017), Best Companies Group (Best Places to Work in PA: 2012-18) and the Philadelphia Business Journal (Advancing Women Company Award: 2014). Additionally, the strong representation of women in our workforce led the Forum of Executive Women to recognize us as a Top Global Company for the Professional Advancement of Women in 2014. As of March 31, 2019, approximately 39% of our employees were women, including over 28% of employees serving in senior roles. We believe that our culture will continue to play an important role in supporting our future growth. 
Organizational Structure
Initial Public Offering and Reorganization
HLI was incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 31, 2007 and conducted its initial public offering (“IPO”) in March 2017. HLI is a holding company with no direct operations. Its principal asset is an equity interest in HLA. It serves as the managing member of HLA and operates and controls all of HLA’s business and affairs.
In connection with the IPO, we completed a series of transactions in order to effect a corporate reorganization, which we refer to collectively throughout this Form 10-K as the “Reorganization”. As part of the Reorganization, we changed our structure to what is commonly referred to as an “Up-C” structure, which provides our pre-IPO owners with the tax advantage of continuing to own interests in a pass-through structure and provides potential future tax benefits for both the public company and the legacy owners (through the tax receivable agreement) when they ultimately exchange their pass-through interests for shares of Class A common stock. HLI has dual-class common stock, the rights of which are described in more detail below. The below chart summarizes our organizational structure as of March 31, 2019.
6


(1) | The Class B Holders, who hold Class B units, and Class C Holders, who hold Class C units, are pre-IPO owners of our business who continue to hold their interests directly in HLA. Class B units and Class C units may be exchanged on a one-for-one basis for shares of Class A common stock or, at our election, for cash, pursuant to and subject to the restrictions set forth in the exchange agreement.


(2) | We hold all of the Class A units of HLA, representing the right to receive approximately 50.3% of the distributions made by HLA. We act as the sole manager of HLA and operate and control all of its business and affairs.

Class A and Class B Common Stock 
Our Class A common stock is our publicly traded stock and is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “HLNE”. Our Class B common stock was issued as part of the Reorganization to the holders of our Class B units, who are certain significant outside investors, members of management and significant employee owners. There is no trading market for our Class B common stock.
Economic Rights
Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to full economic rights, including the right to receive dividends when and if declared by our board of directors, subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to any restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the terms of any outstanding preferred stock. 
7

Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to receive only the par value of the Class B common stock upon exchange of the corresponding Class B unit pursuant to the exchange agreement. The exchange of a Class B unit will result in the redemption and cancellation of the corresponding share of Class B common stock.
Voting Rights
Except as provided in our certificate of incorporation or by applicable law, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class. Our Class A common stock entitles the holder to one vote per share. Our Class B common stock entitles the holder to ten votes per share until a Sunset becomes effective. After a Sunset becomes effective, each share of Class B common stock will then entitle the holder to one vote. 
A “Sunset” is triggered by any of the following: (i) Hartley R. Rogers, Mario L. Giannini and their respective permitted transferees collectively cease to maintain direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least 10% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock (determined assuming all outstanding Class B units and Class C units have been exchanged for Class A common stock); (ii) Mr. Rogers, Mr. Giannini, their respective permitted transferees and employees of us and our subsidiaries cease collectively to maintain direct or indirect beneficial ownership of an aggregate of at least 25% of the aggregate voting power of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock; (iii) Mr. Rogers and Mr. Giannini both voluntarily terminate their employment and all directorships with HLA and us (other than by reason of death or, as determined in good faith by our board of directors, disability, incapacity or retirement); or (iv) the occurrence of the later of March 31, 2027 or the end of the fiscal year in which occurs the fifth anniversary of the death of the second to die of Mr. Rogers and Mr. Giannini. A Sunset triggered under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) during the first two fiscal quarters will generally become effective at the end of that fiscal year, and a Sunset triggered under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) during the third or fourth fiscal quarters will generally become effective at the end of the following fiscal year. A Sunset pursuant to clause (iv) will become effective on the occurrence of the latest event listed in clause (iv), unless a Sunset is also triggered under clause (i) or (ii) that would result in an earlier Sunset, in which case the earlier Sunset will result.
If Mr. Rogers or Mr. Giannini voluntarily terminates his employment and directorships as contemplated by clause (iii) after the death of the other, then the Sunset will become effective on the timing set out in clause (iii). Otherwise, a voluntary termination as to only one of them will result in a Sunset becoming effective on the timing set out in clause (iv). Because a Sunset may not take place for some time, or at all, certain of the Class B Holders will, by virtue of their voting control of us and the stockholders agreement described below, continue to control us for the near future.
Our Class B common stockholders collectively hold 89.6% of the combined voting power of our common stock. Certain of the holders of our Class B common stock who are significant outside investors, members of management and significant employee owners have, pursuant to a stockholders agreement, agreed to vote all of their shares in accordance with the instructions of HLAI, our controlling stockholder. The parties to the stockholders agreement control almost 90% of the combined voting power of our common stock. This group is therefore able to exercise control over all matters requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. 
 When a Class B Holder exchanges Class B units pursuant to the exchange agreement, it will result in the redemption and cancellation of the corresponding number of shares of our Class B common stock in 
8

exchange for a cash payment of the par value of such shares and, therefore, will decrease the aggregate voting power of our Class B Holders. 
Business Strategy
The alternative investment industry has experienced significant and consistent growth, which we expect to continue and contribute to our future growth. Given our leading market position and strong reputation in investing and client service, our objective is to continue to leverage the following strategic advantages to exceed the industry growth rate. 
Develop innovative private markets solutions. Many of our clients engage us because of our ability to create customized programs that meet their particular investment needs and provide access to a broad spectrum of private markets investment opportunities. We believe that a broad range of solutions across almost every private markets asset class enables us to remain a leader in structuring private markets investment portfolios and to continue to provide the best solutions for our existing and future clients. We intend to continue to meet our clients’ demands for alternative investments via primary, secondary and direct/co-investment opportunities, which provide attractive return characteristics, as well as innovative specialized fund products, while at the same time allowing us to benefit from economies of scale. In addition, we intend to expand into adjacent asset classes, which will allow us to further broaden our solutions capabilities, diversify our business mix and allow us to benefit from growth in private markets asset classes, such as private debt.
Expand distribution channels. We continue to build a scalable, cost-effective global institutional sales organization, which provides us with a strong local presence in several markets. Our sales organization comprises our business development and product groups which are both dedicated to marketing our services and products globally. In addition, we intend to increase our profile with influential intermediaries that advise individual and institutional clients, particularly small and medium-sized institutions and high-net-worth families and family offices. We may also enter into strategic distribution partnerships with financial institutions in certain geographical regions and market sectors to gain access to their captive client bases. As we continue to explore different ways to access alternative distribution channels, we are also acting as “sub-advisor” for financial intermediaries with significant distribution strength. In this role, we perform a range of investment services from portfolio construction to investment management, while the distribution partner focuses on product distribution and client service. In the context of these partnerships, the distribution partner often aims to provide its clients with products under its own brand, which we achieve by rebranding our existing offerings or by creating customized offerings carrying the distribution partner’s name. We anticipate increasing sub-advisory opportunities as we continue to target high-net-worth individuals and families.
Diversify and grow client base. We aim to continue to expand our relationships with existing clients and intend to capitalize on significant opportunities in new client segments globally, such as smaller institutions and high-net-worth investors. We believe these investors offer an attractive opportunity to further diversify and grow our client base because many of them only recently have begun to invest in, or increase their allocations to, alternative investments. 
Expand private markets solutions and products to defined contribution, retail and similar pools of investable assets. We believe we are pioneers in the creation, distribution, and management of products such as specialized secondaries, direct/co-investments and specialty credit strategies that are designed to serve defined contribution retirement plans and similar entities. Many of our defined contribution retirement plan clients are based outside of the United States, ranging across Australia, Europe, and Latin America, among other geographies. While these clients tend to have lower private markets allocations than those of defined benefit pension plans, their comfort with, interest in and allocations to private 
9

markets alternative investments have tended to increase over time, due in part to significant advancements in the areas of private markets data and benchmarking, where we believe we play a leading role. Therefore, we intend to continue to develop, market and manage investment solutions and products specifically aimed at helping these investors create appropriately structured private markets alternatives programs.
Expand globally. Over the past 17 years, we have substantially grown our global presence, both in terms of clients and investments, by expanding our international offices as well as our client presence. We have built a significant presence to serve clients in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and Canada, and we have offices in London, Munich, Rio de Janeiro, Tel Aviv, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, Sydney and Toronto. In each of these places, we serve major institutional clients, and we review and commit capital to established local private markets funds on behalf of our clients. Our aim is to continue expanding our global presence through further direct investment in personnel, development of client relationships and increased investments with, and direct and co-investments alongside, established private markets fund managers.
We believe that many institutional investors outside the United States are currently underinvested in private markets asset classes and that capturing capital inflows into private capital investing from non-U.S. global markets represents a significant growth opportunity for us. We think that investors from developing regions will increasingly seek branded multi-capability alternative investment managers with which to invest. We believe that geographically and economically diverse non-U.S. investors will require a highly bespoke approach and will demand high levels of transparency, governance and reporting. We have seen this pattern developing in many places, including Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, Australasia, Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia and China, and have positioned ourselves to take advantage of it by establishing local presences with global investment capabilities. 
We believe we are uniquely capable of pursuing the opportunities arising from increased allocations among institutional investors and the rapid wealth creation globally among high-net-worth individuals because of our strong brand recognition, multi-office resources, experienced team of investment professionals and comprehensive suite of products and services.
Leverage proprietary databases and analytics to enhance our existing service offerings and develop new products and services. When compared to more liquid investment areas, the private markets industry is characterized by the limited availability and inconsistency of quality information. We believe that the general trend toward transparency and consistency in private markets reporting will create new opportunities for us. We intend to use the advantages afforded to us by our proprietary databases, analytical tools and deep industry knowledge to drive our performance and provide our clients with customized solutions across private markets asset classes. We expect that our data and analytical capabilities will play an important role in continuing to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors. 
In addition to continually expanding our own database, we develop strategic partnerships with, and opportunistically seek minority stakes in, innovative solutions providers such as Private Market Connect (data collection and management), Black Mountain (allocation software) and Bison Cobalt (benchmarking and diligence).

Investment Types
We provide our clients access to private markets investment opportunities diversified across financing stages, geographic regions and industries through the investment types described below.

• | Primary Investments. Primary investments are investments in private markets funds at the time the funds are initially launched. At the time we commit capital to a fund on behalf of our specialized funds or customized separate accounts, the investments that the fund will make are generally not known and investors typically have very little or no ability to influence the investments that are made during the fund’s investment period. Primary funds usually have a contractual duration of between 10 and 15 years, with the capital deployed over a period of typically four to six years. For advisory and customized separate account clients, our investment recommendations and decisions are designed to achieve specific portfolio construction and return objectives mutually developed by us and the clients. Subject to specific client investment guidelines, we rarely invest in “first time” funds unless the management team has previously worked successfully together and built a credible and impressive track record.


• | Secondary Investments. Secondary investments are investments in private markets funds through secondary market purchases of existing fund interests from existing limited partners in those funds. The private secondary market is a non-regulated private market in which buyers and sellers directly negotiate the terms of transactions. The secondary market has grown dramatically in the last 20 years and today provides a reliable liquidity option for owners of private markets interests as well as attractive buying opportunities for secondary investors. Institutional investors utilize the secondary market for strategic portfolio rebalancing, rationalizing overlapping positions resulting from mergers and acquisitions or providing liquidity when facing cash constraints.

Secondary transactions typically fall within the following categories:

◦ | Single Funds: These transactions are often too small for the larger secondary funds and brokers and can be accessed through proprietary or less competitive sourcing methods.


◦ | Subset Portfolios: In these transactions, we typically target a multi-fund portfolio with limited information and/or transfer restrictions.


◦ | Structured/Direct Transactions: These transactions typically involve the direct purchase of companies alongside an existing or new manager, including fund manager spin-outs and fund manager restructurings.


• | Direct/co-investments. Direct/co-investments are direct investments alongside private markets funds in underlying portfolio companies. Our direct/co-investment strategy starts with actively soliciting the managers of private markets funds in which we have made investments to offer our specialized funds and customized separate accounts all direct/co-investment opportunities that may arise from their investment operations.

The investment team analyzes and considers each deal to select those opportunities that best suit the direct/co-investment funds’ investment objectives and create an appropriate diversity of investment type, industry, geography and manager. We generally make direct/co-investments on a parallel basis with the private markets funds and managers leading the investments, by purchasing similar securities on similar terms with exit provisions that allow the direct/co-investment funds through which we invest to realize their investments at the same time and on a pro rata basis. 

• | Strategic Opportunities Funds: Our Strategic Opportunities funds are short duration, private markets funds that seek to create a portfolio of opportunistically oriented, private markets

11

investments that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns through a flexible and diversified investment strategy. The funds seek to invest across the entire capital structure and primarily utilize credit direct/co-investments, as well as tail-end secondary investments, to create a portfolio biased toward shorter-duration exposures and downside protection, including a current yield component. The Strategic Opportunities funds also may seek to layer into the portfolio construction opportunistic investments, including unique equity positions and investments in areas of market dislocation. These funds leverage our existing platform to generate additional attractive deal flow. 
Investment Process and Monitoring
Our investment team is divided into five dedicated teams for primary investments, secondary investments, direct/co-investments, real assets and research. Primary investments, secondary, direct/co-investments and real assets have their own discrete investment committees, although there is significant overlap among committee members. 
Our investment process has six key steps: investment origination; preliminary screening; due diligence evaluation; financial analysis; investment evaluation and decision-making; and negotiation, documentation and closing. Each step is described below:

• | Investment Origination. Fund managers raising new funds and seeking institutional investors typically market their funds directly to us. For secondary investments and direct/co-investments, we aggressively pursue attractive opportunities through our network of fund manager relationships, consultants and, to a lesser extent, third-party distributors.


• | Preliminary Screening. For primary fund investment opportunities, including real estate, the screening process consists of a formal review of any private placement memorandum that we receive from a prospective fund manager. A screening memo is prepared by the fund investment team and the investment committee makes a decision whether to proceed to due diligence or decline the investment opportunity. For secondary and direct/co-investment opportunities, each investment is evaluated by the respective investment teams and the most attractive opportunities are reviewed in a formal screening process by the investment committee.


• | Due Diligence Evaluation. For primary fund investments that proceed past the initial screening process, we meet in person with the fund manager. A meeting memo prepared by the investment team based on the meeting is presented to the investment committee for a formal vote. If we elect to move forward, we issue a detailed questionnaire to the fund manager. We subsequently conduct a site visit at the fund manager’s office. Lastly, we prepare a final investment report, which provides details on the manager’s performance, merits and issues, as well as in-depth analysis of the portfolio.

Among the direct/co-investment opportunities we review, only the most attractive move to more intensive due diligence. The initial due diligence may include meeting and interviewing management and company personnel, multiple meetings and discussions with the lead sponsor, review of materials and reports developed by the private markets fund manager and external consultants to evaluate the investment and engaging additional advisors when appropriate. In addition, we conduct industry and competitive analyses and a risk analysis on the opportunity.

• | Financial Analysis. All investment opportunities that pass the initial due diligence review undergo a quantitative, rigorous financial and valuation review. For primary investments, financial

12

analysis includes a thorough review of the fund manager’s historical track record, in which we seek to identify the drivers of return.
Our secondary investment analysis involves both a bottom-up and a top-down analysis of each potential investment. The bottom-up analysis calculates individual values for each underlying portfolio company within the fund. The top-down analysis focuses on assessment of the markets, both public and private, as well as a rigorous review of the fund manager. This review includes historical returns, average holding periods, investment style and risk profile. These two separate analyses are then combined and weighted in order to calculate an offering price for the portfolio.
For direct/co-investments, the company financial projections are studied, as well as the prospective capital structure and credit risk, and sensitivity analyses of the direct/co-investment’s projected returns. 

• | Investment Evaluation and Decision-Making. Throughout the due diligence process, the investment team meets periodically with members of the investment committee in an iterative, dynamic “give and take” process leading to the investment decision stage.

For primary investments, the investment committee votes on each opportunity three times before it is formally approved: (i) at the screening stage; (ii) after the initial meeting; and (iii) when the final due diligence report is completed. At each stage, the investment team prepares a memorandum to the committee summarizing the diligence efforts to that point. The investment is then discussed formally by the investment team and the investment committee members to determine if it is attractive enough to move forward or, in the last stage, make an investment.
For secondary investments and direct/co-investments, the investment committee processes are more iterative. Opportunities are reviewed in investment committee meetings, and the discussion among the investment teams and the committee guides the diligence process. As the diligence process progresses, the investment committee makes the decision of whether to continue working on the transaction or to decline. At the final decision stage, a formal vote is required from the investment committee to make an investment.

• | Negotiation, Documentation and Closing. Upon recommendation of an investment, we attend to all aspects of the negotiation, documentation and closing processes. Our in-house legal team is mobilized to review the transaction documents, including, in the case of direct/co-investments, the governing documents of the direct/co-investment vehicle and stockholders or comparable agreement setting forth the rights of the direct/co-investors. Throughout the documentation and closing process, the investment team and the legal team work closely together to maximize economic terms and legal rights and protections for our clients and our specialized funds.

Investment Performance
The following tables present information relating to the historical performance of our discretionary investment accounts. The data for these investments is presented from the date indicated through December 31, 2018 and have not been adjusted to reflect acquisitions or disposals of investments subsequent to that date.
When considering the data presented below, you should note that the historical results of our discretionary investments are not indicative of the future results you should expect from such investments, from any future investment funds we may raise or from an investment in our Class A common stock, in part because:

• | market conditions and investment opportunities during previous periods may have been

13

significantly more favorable for generating positive performance than those we may experience in the future;

• | the performance of our funds is generally calculated on the basis of the net asset value (“NAV”) of the funds’ investments, including unrealized gains, which may never be realized;


• | our historical returns derive largely from the performance of our earlier funds, whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of our newer funds or funds not yet formed;


• | our newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they initially deploy their capital;


• | in recent years, there has been increased competition for investment opportunities resulting from the increased amount of capital invested in private markets alternatives and high liquidity in debt markets, and the increased competition for investments may reduce our returns in the future; and


• | the performance of particular funds also will be affected by risks of the industries and businesses in which they invest.

The historical and potential future returns of the investment funds we manage are not directly linked to returns on our Class A common stock. Therefore, you should not conclude that continued positive performance of the investment funds we manage will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our Class A common stock. As used in this discussion, internal rate of return (“IRR”) is calculated on a pooled basis using daily cash flows. Gross IRR is presented net of management fees, carried interest and expenses charged by the general partners of the underlying investments, but does not include our management fees, carried interest or expenses. See “—Performance Methodology” below for more information on how our returns are calculated.
Specialized Fund Performance
We organize, invest and manage primary, secondary and direct/co-investment funds. Our funds invest across a variety of private markets and include equity, equity-linked and credit funds offered on standard terms, as well as shorter duration, opportunistically oriented funds. Below is performance information across our various specialized funds. All of these funds are globally focused, and they are grouped by the investment strategy utilized.

Performance Methodology
The indices presented for comparison are the S&P 500, MSCI World, Credit Suisse High Yield II (“CS HY II”) and Credit Suisse Leverage Loan (“CS LL”), calculated on a PME basis. We believe these indices are commonly used by private markets and credit investors to evaluate performance. The PME calculation methodology allows private markets investment performance to be evaluated against a public index and assumes that capital is being invested in, or withdrawn from, the index on the days the capital was called and distributed from the underlying fund managers. The S&P 500 Index is a total return capitalization-weighted index that measures the performance of 500 U.S. large cap stocks. The MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index of over 1,600 world stocks that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets. The CS HY II Index, formerly known as the DLJ High Yield Index, is designed to mirror the investable universe of the U.S. dollar denominated high yield debt market. Prices for the CS HY II Index are available on a weekly basis. The CS LL Index is an index designed to mirror the investable universe of the U.S. dollar denominated leveraged loan market. Loans must be rated 5B or lower and the index frequency is monthly.

Our IRR represents the pooled IRR for all discretionary investments for the period from inception to December 31, 2018. The returns are net of management fees, carried interest and expenses charged by the underlying fund managers, but do not include our management fees, carried interest or expenses. Our IRR would decrease with the inclusion of our management fees, carried interest and expenses. 
The “Realized IRR” represents the pooled IRR for those discretionary investments that we consider realized for purposes of our track record, which are investments where the underlying investment fund has been fully liquidated, has generated a distributions to paid-in capital ratio (“DPI”) greater than or equal to 1.0, or is older than six years and has a residual value to paid-in capital ratio (“RVPI”) less than or equal to 0.2. Hamilton Lane Secondary Realized includes investments that have been fully liquidated, have a DPI greater than or equal to 1.0, or a RVPI less than or equal to 0.2. Hamilton Lane Realized Co-Investment and Hamilton Lane Realized Strategic Opportunities include investments that have been fully liquidated or have a DPI greater than or equal to 1.0. “Unrealized” includes all investments that do not meet the aforementioned criteria. DPI represents total distributions divided by total invested capital. RVPI represents the remaining market value divided by total invested capital. “Capital Invested” refers to the total amount of all investments made by a fund, including commitment-reducing and non-commitment-reducing capital calls. “Multiple” represents total distributions from underlying investments to the fund plus the fund’s market value divided by total contributed capital. “Gross Multiple” is presented net of management fees, carried interest and expenses charged by the fund managers of the underlying investments.
Specialized fund and pre-fund performance does not include ten funds-of-funds that have investor-specific investment guidelines. 
Certain of our specialized funds utilize revolving credit facilities, which provide capital that is available to fund investments or pay partnership expenses and management fees. Borrowings may be paid down from time to time with investor capital contributions or distributions from investments. The use of a credit facility affects the fund’s return and magnifies the performance on the upside or on the downside. 
Assets Under Management and Advisement
As of March 31, 2019, we had total AUA and AUM of approximately $484 billion, of which $61 billion represents AUM from our customized separate accounts and specialized funds, and $422 billion represents AUA managed on behalf of our advisory accounts. Our AUM and AUA have distinctive terms and fee arrangements, and therefore are presented separately in this section.
AUM
Our AUM comprises primarily the assets associated with our customized separate accounts and specialized funds. We classify assets as AUM if we have full discretion over the investment decisions in an account. We calculate our AUM as the sum of: 

(1) | the NAV of our clients’ and funds’ underlying investments;


(2) | the unfunded commitments to our clients’ and funds’ underlying investments; and


(3) | the amounts authorized for us to invest on behalf of our clients and fund investors but not committed to an underlying investment.

17

Management fee revenue is based on a variety of factors and is not linearly correlated with AUM. However, we believe AUM is a useful metric for assessing the relative size and scope of our asset management business. 
Our AUM has grown from approximately $33 billion as of March 31, 2015 to approximately $61 billion as of March 31, 2019, representing a CAGR of approximately 17%. The following chart summarizes this growth.
AUA
Our AUA comprise assets from clients for which we do not have full discretion to make investments in their account. We generally earn revenue on a fixed fee basis on our AUA client accounts for services including asset allocation, strategic planning, development of investment policies and guidelines, screening and recommending investments, legal negotiations, monitoring and reporting on investments and investment manager review and due diligence. Advisory fees vary by client based on the amount of annual commitments, services provided and other factors. Since we earn annual fixed fees from the majority of our AUA clients, the growth in AUA from existing accounts does not have a material impact on our revenues. However, we view AUA growth as a meaningful benefit in terms of the amount of data we are able to collect and the degree of influence we have with fund managers. 
Assets related to our advisory accounts have increased from approximately $191 billion as of March 31, 2015, to approximately $422 billion as of March 31, 2019, representing a CAGR of approximately 22%. Our AUA clients are predominately large institutional investors with 46% of AUA related to public pension funds and 39% related to sovereign wealth funds. Our AUA is diversified across geographies with approximately 50% derived from clients based outside of the United States.
18

The following chart summarizes the growth of our AUA since fiscal year 2015.
Diversification of Assets
Given our goal of achieving strong investment returns and portfolio diversification for clients, investments are made across multiple private markets sub-asset classes, including corporate finance/buyout, growth equity, venture capital, mezzanine, distressed debt and other special situation funds (e.g., industry-focused funds and multi-stage funds). Because we have a considerable volume of investment opportunities globally, we selectively invest not only across sub-asset classes, but also across all major geographic regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, Australasia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. 
Fee-Earning Assets Under Management
We view fee-earning AUM as a metric to measure the assets from which we earn management fees. Our fee-earning AUM comprise assets in our customized separate accounts and specialized funds from which we derive management fees. We classify customized separate account revenue as management fees if the client is charged an asset-based fee, which includes the majority of our discretionary AUM accounts but also includes certain non-discretionary AUA accounts. Our fee-earning AUM is equal to the amount of capital commitments, net invested capital and NAV of our customized separate accounts and specialized funds depending on the fee terms. Substantially all of our customized separate accounts and specialized funds earn fees based on commitments or net invested capital, which are not affected by market appreciation or depreciation. Therefore, revenues and fee-earning AUM are not significantly affected by changes in market value. 
Our calculations of fee-earning AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our 
19

definition of fee-earning AUM is not based on any definition that is set forth in the agreements governing the customized separate accounts or specialized funds that we manage.
As of March 31, 2019, our fee-earning AUM was approximately $34 billion compared to $61 billion in AUM. The difference is due primarily to $21 billion of discretionary AUM earning a flat fee or fee on number of funds for which we categorize revenue as advisory and reporting. This was partially offset by $3 billion of fee-earning AUM from customized separate accounts clients with non-discretionary AUA. The remaining $9 billion is non fee-earning AUM.
The following chart summarizes the growth of our fee-earning AUM since fiscal year 2015.

Our Clients
Our client base primarily comprises institutional investors that range from those seeking to make an initial investment in alternative assets to some of the largest and most sophisticated private markets investors. As a highly customized, flexible outsourcing partner, we are equipped to provide investment services to institutional clients of all sizes and with different needs, internal resources and investment objectives. Our clients include prominent institutional investors in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and Latin America. We believe we are a leading provider of private markets solutions for U.S. labor union pension plans, and we serve numerous smaller public and corporate pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, financial institutions and insurance companies, endowments and foundations, as well as family offices and selected high-net-worth individuals.
As of March 31, 2019, our client and investor base included over 500 institutions and intermediaries and is broadly diversified by type, size and geography. Our intermediary clients enable us to provide our investment products to an expanded range of high-net-worth individuals and families. We have a diversified revenue stream from a variety of client types in multiple geographic regions, with no single 
20

client representing more than 5% of management and advisory fee revenues. Approximately 47% of our fiscal 2019 management and advisory fee revenues came from clients based outside of the United States. A significant portion of our revenue base is recurring and, based on the long-term nature of our funds as well as long-term relationships with many of our clients, provides highly predictable cash flows. For the year ended March 31, 2019, our top 10 clients generated approximately 23% of management and advisory fee revenues, and our top 20 clients generated approximately 34% of management and advisory fee revenues.
Sales and Marketing
Our business development group consists of employees around the world, including in the United States, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Israel, Australia and Germany. We intend to grow our global sales force as we seek to continue to build our client base and pursue growth opportunities in less developed private equity markets such as Asia and Australia. See “—Business Strategy.” The execution of our marketing strategy relies primarily on our own business development group, which historically has generated the substantial majority of our new client engagements. To enhance our access to markets where we do not currently have a local presence or that are dominated by captive client relationship models, we selectively engage highly respected third-party organizations to market our products and services. For example, we use third-party distributors in Asia and Latin America (other than Brazil).
Our business development group is responsible for identifying and contacting prospective clients for our products and services. Our sales people also work directly with consultants that advise smaller and medium-size institutional investors, which often rely on the consultants for advice in the alternative investment area. Following the initial round of meetings and presentations, prospective advisory and customized separate account clients and specialized fund investors that wish to learn more about us often visit our offices with a team to conduct in-depth due diligence of our firm. Our business development people lead this process, coordinate meetings, and continue to be the prospective client’s principal contact with us through the decision-making process.
Client Service
Our client service group includes employees located in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, Brazil, Israel, South Korea, and Australia. At the beginning of the engagement for each advisory account and customized separate account, a member of the relationship management group is assigned as the principal contact person with that client. The relationship managers take primary responsibility for working with the clients to design their strategic plans and to implement those plans in accordance with investment guidelines agreed to by us and the clients. The relationship managers work directly with our allocation committee to ensure that all investment opportunities that are appropriate for their clients are considered. The relationship managers communicate and meet regularly with their clients to discuss potential investments that we are currently considering, funds expected to be raised in the next 12 months, the current status of the clients’ portfolios, investment strategies and overall market conditions.
Within the client service group, our portfolio management services group is dedicated to tracking and reporting on primary investments, secondary investments and direct/co-investments that we manage for our clients. This group also uses the services of third-party administrators and analysts, particularly with respect to specialized funds. We maintain a disciplined investment monitoring process designed to adapt portfolio allocation to enhance returns in our advisory and customized separate account portfolios, as well as in our specialized funds. Once a primary or secondary investment is closed, we have frequent 
21

conversations with private markets fund managers, hold periodic in-person meetings and attend annual meetings and advisory board meetings. This process generally is led by members of the investment team but also includes members of the relationship management team as well as other members of the senior management team. We have active advisory board seats on behalf of our clients and participate on numerous valuation committees.
Our team of professionals closely follows the activities and investments in clients’ portfolios. The team measures adherence to the stated strategies and limited partnership agreement terms. The team is in regular contact with fund managers, which allows for early detection of potential issues and timely development of constructive recommendations. 
We actively track and report on each investment and on overall portfolios. We provide clients with comprehensive and customized quarterly and annual reports. iLevel, our online, interactive client reporting platform, affords clients always available, secure, Internet-based access to their portfolios. Clients can download timely information on cash flows, adjusted valuations, adjusted capital account schedules, underlying portfolio company information and other data provided by private markets fund managers or developed internally by our in-house reporting team.
Fees and Other Key Contractual Terms
Customized Separate Accounts 
We enter into written contracts with each of our customized separate account clients. Within agreed-upon investment guidelines, we generally have full discretion to buy, sell or otherwise effect investment transactions involving the assets in the account, in the name and on behalf of the client, although in some cases certain clients have the right to veto investments. Our discretion generally includes decisions related to, among other matters: voting securities; entering into and terminating contracts; commencing, settling or discontinuing claims or actions; exercising options, conversion or subscription rights; whether to join, dissent from or oppose the reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, merger, sale, mortgage, pledge or lease of any securities or other property constituting a part of the committed capital; depositing the committed capital with any protective, reorganization or similar committee and paying expenses of such committees and assessments on deposits with them; entering into brokerage accounts in the name of the client; and generally taking or refraining from taking any other action related to the investment or reinvestment of the committed capital. The discretion to invest committed capital generally is subject to investment guidelines established by our clients or by us in conjunction with our clients.
Fees. While the specific terms of our contracts vary significantly from client to client, generally our customized separate account clients are charged asset-based fees annually on committed or net invested capital. These fees often decrease over the life of the contract due to built-in declines in contractual rates and/or as a result of lower net invested capital balances as capital is returned to clients. For some customized separate accounts, we charge clients annual fixed fees, and, in certain cases, we earn an incentive fee based on realized gains, particularly when the investment strategies include secondary investments and direct/co-investments. In certain cases, we provide advisory services and therefore we also receive fees for services such as monitoring and reporting on a client’s existing private markets investments. In addition, we may provide for investments in our specialized funds as part of our customized separate accounts, and therefore we also receive incentive fees based on realized gains of investments in our specialized funds under their terms. We reduce the management fees on customized separate accounts to the extent that assets in the accounts are invested in our specialized funds so that our clients do not pay duplicate fees.
22

Duration and Termination. Customized separate account contracts have varying durations of up to 12 years or indefinite lives, and typically can be terminated by our clients for any reason generally upon 30 to 90 days’ notice or can only be terminated for specified reasons. Some contracts provide for termination on shorter or longer notice. Some contracts provide for penalty fees to be paid to us if termination occurs before the end of the stated term in the absence of cause. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Customized separate account and advisory account fee revenue is not a long-term contracted source of revenue and is subject to intense competition” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Structure. Most of our customized separate accounts are simple contractual arrangements involving an investment management agreement between us and the client. In some cases, at the client’s request, we establish a separate investment vehicle, generally a limited partnership with the client as the sole limited partner and a wholly owned subsidiary of HLA as the general partner. Our capital commitment to the limited partnership is generally 1% of total capital commitments but in certain cases may be higher or lower. We manage the limited partnership under an investment management agreement between the partnership and us. The limited partnership generally is formed in Delaware or a non-U.S. jurisdiction, such as the Cayman Islands, in accordance with the client’s specifications. We manage all aspects of the limited partnership, utilizing the services of third parties as needed, including administrators and custodial banks. Our fees for these customized separate accounts are substantially the same as customized separate accounts that do not involve a separate investment vehicle. 
Specialized Funds
Since 1997, we have sponsored 21 primary funds, four secondary funds, five direct/co-investment funds, five Strategic Opportunities funds and one Small Business Investment Company fund. The terms of each fund vary. We have described below the key terms of these funds. 
Capital Commitments. Investors in our specialized funds generally make commitments to provide capital at the outset of a fund and deliver capital when called upon by us, as investment opportunities become available and to fund operational expenses and other obligations. The commitments are generally available for investment for three to six years, during what we call the commitment period. However, our Strategic Opportunities funds have one- to two-year commitment periods and, in the case of one of our direct/co-investment funds, the investors do not commit capital at the commencement of the fund but rather have the right to make their own investment decisions as to each investment opportunity that we present to them. We typically have invested the capital committed to our funds, other than our Strategic Opportunities funds, over a three- to five-year period. 
Structure. We conduct the management of our specialized funds primarily through structures in which limited partnerships organized by us accept commitments or funds from investors. The investors become limited partners in the funds and a separate entity that we form and control acts as the general partner. Our capital commitment to the limited partnership is generally 1% of total capital commitments. HLA, to which we refer as the “Manager,” generally serves as the investment manager of our funds. The Manager is registered as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Investment Advisers Act”). Responsibility for helping a fund’s general partner with all aspects of the day-to-day operations of the fund generally is delegated to the Manager pursuant to an investment management agreement. The material terms of our investment management agreements relate to the scope of services to be rendered by the Manager to the applicable funds and certain rights of termination. The funds themselves do not register as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), in reliance on exemptions from such registration.
The Manager generally makes all decisions concerning the making, monitoring and disposing of investments pursuant to authority delegated by the specialized fund’s general partner. The limited partners 
23

take no part in the conduct or control of the business of the funds, have no right or authority to act for or bind the funds and have no influence over the voting or disposition of the securities or other assets held by the funds. These decisions are made by us as the Manager in our sole discretion pursuant to authority delegated by the general partner, subject to the investment limitations set forth in the agreements governing each fund. The limited partners often have the right to remove the general partner for cause or effect an early dissolution by supermajority vote, or in certain cases by a simple majority vote. In addition, the governing agreements of our funds typically require the suspension of the commitment period if, depending on the fund, between two and ten designated principals of the Manager cease to devote sufficient professional time to or cease to be employed by the Manager, often called a “key man event”, or in connection with certain other events discussed under “—Duration, Redemption and Termination.” See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our ability to retain our senior management team and attract additional qualified investment professionals is critical to our success” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
Management Fees. We earn management fees based on a percentage of limited partners’ capital commitments to, or net invested capital in, our specialized funds. The management fee during the commitment period is charged on capital commitments and after the commitment period (or a defined anniversary of the fund’s initial closing) is reduced by a percentage of the management fee for the preceding year or charged on net invested capital. In the case of certain funds, we charge management fees on capital commitments, with the management fee increasing during the early years of the fund’s term and declining in the later years. Management fees for certain funds are discounted based on the amount of the limited partners’ commitments or if the limited partners are investors in our other funds. Management fees would be reduced in the event that any monitoring, consulting, investment banking, advisory, transaction, directors’ or break-up or similar fees are paid to the fund’s general partner, the Manager or any of their affiliates or principals. 
Incentive Fees. The incentive fees charged by our specialized funds are generally referred to as “carried interest.” Our primary funds invest the majority of their capital in other private markets funds on a primary basis, and certain of our primary funds earn carried interest on these investments. To the extent that our primary funds also directly make secondary investments and direct/co-investments, they generally earn carried interest equal to a fixed percentage of net profits, subject to a compounded annual preferred return in respect of those investments. Carried interest from these primary funds is earned on a “full return” basis when all invested capital and the applicable preferred return has been received or on a “deal-by-deal” basis when all capital invested and the applicable preferred return has been received either on all realized investments or on each individual investment. 
For each of our secondary funds, direct/co-investment funds and Strategic Opportunities funds, we generally earn carried interest equal to a fixed percentage of net profits, subject to a compounded annual preferred return that varies based on fund type. In our secondary funds, we generally earn carried interest on a full-return basis. In the case of certain of our direct/co-investment funds and our Strategic Opportunities funds, we earn carried interest on a deal-by-deal basis.
If, upon the final distribution of any of our specialized funds from which we earn carried interest, the relevant fund’s general partner has received cumulative carried interest in excess of the amount to which it would be entitled from the profits calculated for such investments in the aggregate, or if the limited partners have not received distributions equal to those to which they are entitled, the general partner will return such part of any carried interest to the limited partners as is necessary to ensure that they receive the amounts to which they are entitled, less taxes on the carried interest. We refer to these provisions as “clawbacks.” Most of our funds that provide for carried interest require a full return of capital and 
24

expenses to investors before any carried interest is paid to us, which minimizes the risk of a clawback obligation. 
Duration, Redemption and Termination. Our specialized funds, other than our Strategic Opportunities funds, generally terminate 10 to 14 years after either the first or last date on which a limited partner is admitted to the fund, or, in the case of certain funds, terminate on a specified anniversary date. Our main primary, secondary and direct/co-investment funds have an average term of approximately 12 years. Our Strategic Opportunities funds terminate five years after the last date on which a limited partner may be admitted to the fund. Our funds are generally subject to extension for up to two years at the discretion of the general partner and thereafter if consent of the requisite majority of limited partners or, in some cases, the fund’s advisory committee is obtained. 
Limited partnership interests in our specialized funds are not subject to redemption prior to termination of the funds. Termination or dissolution of the funds and the suspension of their commitment periods, however, can generally be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain customary events, including key man events, bankruptcy and similar events and the occurrence of fraud, willful malfeasance or gross negligence and other similar events. Such funds also may be terminated upon the affirmative vote, depending on the fund, of 75% to 85% of the total limited partner interests entitled to vote.
Advisory Services
We enter into written contracts with each of our advisory services clients. Advisory service clients are generally charged annual fixed fees, which vary depending on the services we provide. In limited cases, advisory service clients are charged basis point fees annually based on the amounts they have committed to invest pursuant to their agreements with us. In other cases where our services are limited to monitoring and reporting on investment portfolios, clients are charged a fee based on the number of investments in their portfolio. We generally do not earn incentive fees based on advisory contracts.
Our advisory services contracts have various durations ranging from one year to indefinite terms. A majority of our advisory service contracts have durations of approximately three years and renew at the option of the client at the end of the stated term. Advisory contracts can typically be terminated by our clients for any reason upon short notice, generally 30 to 90 days, although some contracts provide for termination on shorter or longer notice or can only be terminated for specified reasons. Advisory contracts with governmental pension plans typically are subject to a renewal process involving our submission of information in response to a request for proposal (“RFP”) issued by the client. We submit extensive, detailed information pursuant to the RFP procedures on a confidential basis, often in competition with other investment advisors bidding on the contract. In these cases, we generally do not know the identity of the other bidders or the substance of their proposals. The RFP procedures prohibit communications between bidders and the issuer of the RFP relating to the proposals during the bidding process.
Distribution Management 
We enter into written contracts with each of our distribution management clients. These clients engage us to manage the liquidation of publicly traded securities that they receive as distributions from funds in which they are investors. Our agreements provide for either “managed liquidation” where the securities are sold within 90 days after distribution or “active management” where the securities are sold over a longer period. 
Distribution management clients are charged basis point fees on either the net proceeds received from the sale of their securities or the aggregate amount of a client’s managed assets and vary depending on whether the account is for managed liquidation or active management services. Alternatively, active 
25

management clients may elect an incentive fee structure under which they are charged an asset-based fee plus an incentive fee based on net realized and unrealized gains and income net of realized and unrealized losses. The incentive fee is then credited to a notional account, and we are entitled to a fixed percentage of any positive balance in the notional account on an annual basis. The remaining portion of any positive balance in the notional account is carried forward to the following year. If the incentive fee calculation results in a negative amount in a given year, that amount is applied to reduce the balance in the notional account. We are not required to repay any negative balance in the notional amount.
Distribution management contracts have varying durations, some with indefinite terms, and typically can be terminated by our clients for any reason generally upon 30 to 90 days’ notice. Some contracts provide for termination on shorter or longer notice.
Competition
We compete in all aspects of our business with a large number of asset management firms, commercial banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions. With respect to our specialized funds, we primarily compete with the alternative asset management businesses of a number of large international financial institutions and established local and regional competitors based in the United States, Europe and Asia, including managers offering funds-of-funds, secondary funds and direct/co-investment funds in the private markets. Our principal competition for customized separate accounts is mostly other highly specialized and independent private markets asset management firms. We compete primarily in the advisory services area of the business with firms that are regionally based and with a select number of large consulting firms for whom private markets investments is only one, often small, portion of their overall business.
In order to grow our business, we must be able to compete effectively to maintain our existing client base and attract additional clients in advisory services, customized separate account and specialized fund areas of the business. Historically, we have competed principally on the basis of the factors listed below:

• | Global access to private markets investment opportunities through our size, scale, reputation and strong relationships with private markets fund managers;


• | Brand recognition and reputation within the investing community;


• | Performance of investment strategies;


• | Quality of service and duration of client relationships;


• | Ability to provide cost effective and comprehensive range of services and products; and


• | Clients’ perceptions of our independence and the alignment of our interests with theirs created through our investment in our own products.

The asset management business is intensely competitive, and in addition to the above factors, our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract highly qualified investment professionals and retain existing employees.

Legal and Compliance
Reporting to our chief executive officer, our general counsel oversees our legal team, which is comprised of attorneys located primarily in our corporate headquarters in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Most of our customized separate account clients and certain of our advisory clients rely on us to review, analyze and negotiate the terms of the documents relating to primary, secondary and direct/co-investments. Working together with our investment teams, our attorneys negotiate directly with fund managers and deal sponsors and their counsel the terms of all limited partnership agreements, subscription documents, side letters, purchase agreements and other documents relating to primary, secondary and direct/co-investments. Our attorneys also review and make recommendations regarding amendments and requests for consents presented by the fund managers from time to time. In addition, our legal team is responsible for preparing, reviewing and negotiating all documents relating to the formation and operation of our funds. We utilize the services of outside counsel as we deem necessary.
Our compliance team is led by our chief compliance officer, who reports to our chief executive officer. Our chief compliance officer has day-to-day management responsibility for the compliance team. The compliance team is responsible for overseeing and enforcing our policies and procedures relating to compliance with the Investment Advisers Act and related rules and regulations and our code of ethics, as well as the compliance policies and procedures and laws and regulations that apply to our non-U.S. subsidiaries and operations. In addition, the compliance team is responsible for all regulatory matters relating to Hamilton Lane Securities, LLC, our SEC- and FINRA-registered broker-dealer affiliate through which we offer interests in our specialized funds. 
Regulatory Environment
Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States at both the federal and state level. Under these laws and regulations, the SEC and relevant state securities authorities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment advisor from carrying on its business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment advisor and other registrations, censures and fines. 
SEC Regulation
HLA is registered as an investment advisor with the SEC. As a registered investment advisor, it is subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, as well as to examination by the SEC’s staff. The Investment Advisers Act imposes substantive regulation on virtually all aspects of our business and our relationships with our clients. Applicable requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, engaging in transactions with clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, incentive fees, solicitation arrangements, allocation of investments, conflicts of interest, advertising, recordkeeping, reporting and disclosure requirements. The Investment Advisers Act regulates the assignment of advisory contracts by the investment advisor. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an investment advisor’s registration. The failure of HLA to comply with the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act or the SEC could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Our customized separate accounts and specialized funds are not registered under the Investment Company Act because we only form customized separate accounts for, and offer interests in our 
27

specialized funds to, persons who we reasonably believe to be “qualified purchasers” as defined in the Investment Company Act. 
ERISA-Related Regulation
Some of our specialized funds are treated as holding “plan assets” as defined under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), as a result of investments in those funds by benefit plan investors. By virtue of its role as investment manager of these funds, HLA is a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to such benefit plan investors. ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), impose certain duties on persons that are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving benefit plans and “parties in interest” or “disqualified persons” to those plans, and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. With respect to these funds, HLA relies on particular statutory and administrative exemptions from certain ERISA prohibited transactions, which exemptions are highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control. The failure of HLA or us to comply with these various requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
In addition, with respect to other investment funds in which benefit plan investors have invested, but which are not treated as holding “plan assets,” we and HLA rely on certain rules under ERISA in conducting investment management activities. These rules are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties that we do not control. If for any reason these rules were to become inapplicable, we and HLA could become subject to regulatory action or third-party claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Foreign Regulation
We provide investment advisory and other services and raise funds in a number of countries and jurisdictions outside the United States. In many of these countries and jurisdictions, which include the European Union (“EU”), the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the individual member states of each of the EU and EEA, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan and South Korea, we and our operations, and in some cases our personnel, are subject to regulatory oversight and requirements. In general, these requirements relate to registration, licenses for our personnel, periodic inspections, the provision and filing of periodic reports, and obtaining certifications and other approvals. Across the EU, we are subject to the European Union Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) requirements regarding, among other things, registration for marketing activities, the structure of remuneration for certain of our personnel and reporting obligations. Individual member states of the EU have imposed additional requirements that may include internal arrangements with respect to risk management, liquidity risks, asset valuations, and the establishment and security of depository and custodial requirements. 
The application of some of these requirements and regulations to our business will likely change in connection with the anticipated exit of the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) from the EU (“Brexit”). For example, our subsidiaries that are authorized and regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority could potentially lose “passporting” privileges under certain EU directives, such as the AIFMD and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (“MiFID II”), which certain of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts rely upon for access to markets throughout the EU. In preparation for this, we have engaged a third-party alternative investment fund manager (“AIFM”) based in Luxembourg to replace, prior to Brexit, our U.K.-based AIFM for our funds and certain customized separate accounts for the EU. We are also in the process of obtaining a MiFID II license for one of our EU-based (non-U.K.) subsidiaries in the event that the MiFID II license currently held by our U.K.-based subsidiary is no 
28

longer valid after Brexit. While we believe that taking these steps will help to ensure that we are able to continue to conduct business in the U.K. and the EU after Brexit, there remains some uncertainty as to the full extent to which our business could be adversely affected. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Operational risks and data security breaches may disrupt our business, result in losses or limit our growth” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our international operations are subject to certain risks, which may affect our revenue” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information on the risks we face in connection with Brexit.
Employees
We currently have approximately 370 employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
