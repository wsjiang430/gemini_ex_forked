Overview
After 50 years in business, SEI (NASDAQ: SEIC) remains a leading global provider of investment processing, investment management and investment operations solutions that help corporations, financial institutions, financial advisors and ultra-high-net-worth families create and manage wealth. As of December 31, 2018, through its subsidiaries and partnerships in which the company has a significant interest, SEI manages, advises or administers $883.9 billion in hedge, private equity, mutual fund and pooled or separately managed assets, including $307.3 billion in assets under management and $572.5 billion in client assets under administration. Our affiliate, LSV Asset Management (LSV), manages $96.1 billion of assets which are included as assets under management.
Our business platforms include:

• | Investment processing outsourcing platforms for providers of institutional and private-client wealth management services, including banks, trust companies, independent wealth advisers and other financial services firms;


• | Investment management platforms for institutional investors, including retirement plan sponsors, not-for-profit organizations and affluent individual investors; and


• | Investment operations outsourcing platforms for investment management firms, banks, family offices and investment companies that sponsor and distribute mutual funds, hedge funds and alternative investments.

General Development of the Business 
SEI is a leading provider of wealth management business solutions for the financial services industry. For over 50 years, we've anticipated changing market needs and created innovative business solutions designed to help clients meet the challenges of managing personal and institutional wealth. 
We began doing business in 1968 by providing computer-based training simulations for bank loan officers. We developed an investment accounting system for bank trust departments in 1972 and became a leading provider of investment processing outsourcing services to banks and trust institutions in the United States. Later, we broadened these outsourcing services and began offering bank clients a family of mutual funds, as well as investment operations outsourcing services. We became a public company in 1981.
We began to adapt and evolve these platforms for selected global markets in the 1990s, including: investment advisors, retirement plan sponsors and institutional investors, asset management distribution firms, investment managers and affluent individual investors. Today, we serve approximately 11,000 clients in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, South Africa and East Asia.
In each of these markets, we have combined our core competencies - investment processing, investment management and investment operations - to deliver broader and more strategic solutions for clients and markets. Today, we offer a global wealth and investment platform for private banks and wealth services firms; a complete wealth platform for operating an investment

advisory business; a comprehensive Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) platform for retirement plan sponsors and institutional investors; a total operational outsourcing platform for investment managers and a life and wealth platform for ultra-high-net-worth families.
Mission and Strategy
SEI’s mission is to deliver innovative and comprehensive investment processing, investment management and investment operations platforms to help clients achieve lasting success. We also seek to achieve growth in earnings and shareholder value by strengthening our position as a provider of these platforms. To achieve these objectives, we have implemented these strategies:
Create broader solutions for wealth service firms, globally. Banks, investment managers and financial advisors seek to enter new markets, expand their service offerings, provide a differentiated experience to their clients, improve efficiencies, reduce risks and better manage their businesses. We offer comprehensive platforms integrating technology, operating processes and financial products designed to help these institutions better serve their clients and create opportunities to improve their business success.
Help institutional investors manage retirement plans and operating capital, globally. Retirement plan sponsors, not-for-profit organizations and other institutional investors strive to meet their fiduciary obligations and financial objectives while reducing business risk. We deliver customized investment management solutions, as part of a complete OCIO platform, that facilitate more strategic decisions by investors about their investments and more efficient and effective management of their assets.
Support affluent individual investors in the management of their life and wealth goals, globally. Investors demand a holistic wealth management experience that focuses on their life goals and provides them with an integrated array of financial services that includes substantially more than traditional wealth management offerings. We facilitate an in-depth process of goal identification and offer comprehensive life and wealth advisory services including life planning, investments and other financial services that align closely to these goals.
Continue to expand globally. Global markets are complex, in a constant state of flux and present significant opportunities for growth. We have evolved U.S. business models for the global wealth management marketplace, focusing on the needs of institutional investors, private banks, independent wealth advisers, investment managers, investment advisors and affluent individual investors and aid them in managing the complexity of global markets.
Business Model
We are guided by the fundamental principles of our business model in managing the company:

• | Grow organically. We seek to grow organically by:


◦ | delivering current platforms into existing markets and adding new clients;


◦ | expanding business in existing markets by building new platforms; and


◦ | entering adjacent financial markets with existing and new platforms.

We may also make acquisitions and strategic investments in other firms that we believe will expand our capabilities or acquire platforms that may increase future organic growth.

• | Engage clients. We strive to forge intimate and long lasting client relationships, and to be a thought leader in the markets we serve. We believe SEI’s long-lasting client relationships - some of which span decades - are fundamental to enhancing SEI’s financial strength.


• | Enhance financial strength. We focus on achieving long-term sustainable growth in revenues and earnings. We favor businesses and solution platforms that generate recurring revenues and predictable cash flows. We strive to maintain a strong balance sheet and return capital to shareholders through stock purchases and paid dividends.


• | Innovate. We continually invest in product development to meet the emerging needs of markets and clients, keep pace with industry developments and satisfy ever expanding and complex regulatory requirements. We have significant domain knowledge and over 50 years of experience developing new solutions that address our clients' complex business challenges in a manner that enhances their ability to compete effectively. To fuel the innovation process, we strive to nurture SEI’s talented and engaged workforce, and foster an open and collaborative culture. We believe our commitment to capital investments to drive growth - targeting eight to ten percent of annual revenues for platform development - affords us a competitive advantage.

Business Platforms
Investment Processing
Investment processing platforms consist of application and business-process-outsourcing services, professional services and transaction-based services. Investment processing services are primarily delivered through two proprietary platforms: TRUST 3000® and the SEI Wealth PlatformSM (the SEI Wealth Platform or SWP). We offer these services to providers of institutional and private-client wealth management services, including banks, trust companies, independent wealth advisers and other financial services firms. We also deliver these platforms, combined with our investment management platform, to investment advisors and other wealth management and financial services firms. Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we also provide business-process outsourcing services including custodial and sub-custodial services and back-office accounting services. 
The TRUST 3000 platform is a comprehensive trust and investment accounting system that provides securities processing and investment accounting for all types of domestic and global securities and support for multiple account types, including personal trust, corporate trust, institutional trust and non-trust investment accounts. This platform is delivered as Software as a Service (SaaS) or as Platform as a Service (PaaS).
SWP provides a global, unified and scalable platform for operating a wealth management business. This comprehensive platform includes investment processing and infrastructure services, and advanced capabilities to support wealth advisory, asset management, and wealth administration functions. SWP also provides global wealth management capabilities including a 24/7 operating model, global securities processing, and multi-currency accounting and reporting. Built around a client-centric relationship model, SWP has an open architecture and supports workflow management and straight-through processing.
SWP is offered in SaaS and PaaS delivery modes. We began delivering SWP (PaaS) to private banks and independent wealth advisers in the United Kingdom in 2007, to banks in the United States in 2012, and to investment advisor clients in the United States in 2015. We are currently implementing our first SaaS bank client through a multi-year conversion.
Investment processing revenues are earned as monthly fees for contracted SaaS and PaaS services. Revenues are primarily earned based upon the type and number of investor accounts serviced or as a percentage of the market value of the clients’ assets processed. Professional services revenues are earned from contracted, project-oriented services, including client implementations. Transaction-based revenues are earned primarily from commissions earned on securities trades executed on behalf of clients through one of our investment processing platforms. Revenues from investment processing, professional services, and transaction-based services are recognized in Information processing and software servicing fees on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Investment Management
SEI's investment management platform consists of investment products including:

• | money market;


• | fixed-income and equity mutual funds;


• | collective investment products;


• | alternative investment portfolios; and


• | separately managed accounts.

Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we serve as sponsor, administrator, transfer agent, investment advisor, distributor and shareholder servicer for many of these products. We distribute these investment products through investment advisory firms, including investment advisors and banks, and directly to institutional and individual investors.
Investment products are used to construct an investment strategy tailored to meet the needs of different investors, taking into consideration their objectives and risk tolerances. SEI's clients, or the investors served by client intermediaries, are the investors in these products. Investors typically invest in a globally diversified portfolio that consists of multiple asset classes and investment styles.
We have expanded our investment management platform to include other consultative, operational and technology components, and have created diverse solutions tailored to the needs of a specific market. These components may include investment strategies, consulting services, administrative and processing services and technology tools.
As of December 31, 2018, we managed $211.2 billion in assets including:

• | $156.0 billion invested in fixed-income and equity funds and separately managed account programs;


• | $42.9 billion invested in collective trust fund programs; and


• | $12.3 billion invested in liquidity or money market funds.

Page  of 86

An additional $96.1 billion in assets is managed by our unconsolidated affiliate LSV, a registered investment advisor that specializes in value equity management for its clients.
Investment management revenues are earned primarily as a percentage of net assets under management. These revenues are recognized in Asset management, administration and distribution fees on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our interest in the earnings of LSV is recognized in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Investment Operations
Investment operations platforms consist of business-processing-outsourcing services including fund and investment accounting, administration, reconciliation, regulatory and compliance reporting, investor servicing and client reporting. We primarily deliver these platforms to investment management firms that offer traditional and alternative products. We support traditional managers who advise a variety of investment products including:

• | mutual funds;


• | UCITS schemes;


• | collective investment trusts (CITs);


• | exchange-traded funds (ETFs);


• | institutional accounts; and


• | separately managed accounts.

We provide comprehensive platforms to investment managers worldwide that sponsor and distribute alternative investment products such as hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate funds, across both registered and partnership structures. We also provide an investment operations platform that services the family office market in the United States. These platforms are delivered by utilizing a highly-integrated, robust and scalable technology platform adapted to fit the specific business needs of our investment manager clients.
As of December 31, 2018, we administered $572.5 billion in client assets for traditional and alternative investment fund products, including mutual funds, hedge funds and private equity funds. Revenues from these products are earned primarily as a percentage of net assets under administration.
Revenues for the processing of institutional separate accounts and separately managed accounts are generally earned on the number of investor accounts serviced. Assets associated with this separate account processing are not included in reported assets under administration. Both revenue categories are recognized in Asset management, administration and distribution fees on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Business Segments

The percentage of consolidated revenues generated by our business segments for the last three years was:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Private Banks | | % | | | % | 33 | %
Investment Advisors | 25 | % | | 24 | % | 23 | %
Institutional Investors | | % | | | % | | %
Investment Managers | 24 | % | | 23 | % | 21 | %
Investments in New Businesses | 1 | % | | 1 | % | 1 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Private Banks
We are a leading provider of investment processing outsourcing platforms for banks and trust institutions, independent wealth advisers and financial advisors worldwide.
We offer TRUST 3000 investment processing in both SaaS or PaaS delivery modes. SaaS clients outsource investment processing software services and information processing to SEI, but retain responsibility for back-office investment operations. PaaS clients also outsource investment operations, including custody and safekeeping of certain assets, income collection, securities settlement and other back-office accounting activities.
Marketing efforts in this segment are focused on SWP which is currently delivered as PaaS. SWP offers advanced capabilities across the entire range of wealth management processes, including those of large global wealth managers. SWP enables banks and investment service firms of all types to manage the growing complexity of their operations, replace legacy platforms, comply with complex regulations, and make more effective use of capital by outsourcing wealth management services.
In 2015, we signed an existing TRUST 3000 client to be the first large national bank to implement SWP, and the first client to operate SWP as SaaS. This will be a multi-year conversion due to the client’s size, the development work involved to expand SWP to be offered as SaaS, and the scope of integration activities required. While executing this large-scale implementation, we will continue to install other signed clients. We will also continue to manage our current TRUST 3000 relationships toward eventual conversion to SWP.
Contracts with TRUST 3000 clients have initial terms that are generally three to seven years in length. At December 31, 2018, we had significant relationships with 67 bank and trust institutions in the United States. Our principal competitors for this business are: 

• | Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS);


• | Innovest Portfolio Solutions, LLC;


• | Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.; and


• | Fidelity Investments.

Many large financial institutions develop, operate and maintain proprietary investment and trust accounting systems. We consider these “in-house” systems to be a form of competition.
Contracts with SWP clients have initial terms that are generally five to seven years in length. At December 31, 2018, we had significant relationships with 48 banks, independent wealth advisers and other wealth managers located in the United Kingdom and the United States. Our principal competitors for this business, in addition to those named above, are: 

• | Pershing LLC;


• | FNZ UK Ltd.;


• | Temenos Group AG;


• | Avaloq;


• | SS&C Technologies;


• | Fiserv, Inc.; and


• | other smaller technology firms.

We also consider “in-house” systems to be a form of competition.
This segment also offers investment management and distribution programs for banks, wealth managers and other financial services intermediaries. These programs start with SEI’s standard investment solutions, strategies, funds and investment services. We also deliver customized solutions including asset management strategies, as well as investment manager and portfolio research services. Increasingly, asset management distributors with established platforms are seeking to grow their 
Page 6 of 86

businesses by offering broader investment solutions while outsourcing non-client facing investment services activities. We believe we offer our distribution partners a cost-effective way to grow their businesses and offer their investors differentiated investment choices, such as SEI’s goal-based investing solution.
We have business relationships with 282 banks, wealth managers and other financial services intermediaries at December 31, 2018. Our definition of an asset management distribution client for this segment includes financial intermediaries who have exceeded a minimal level of customer assets invested in our investment products. With the growth of our business, the minimal level of customer assets which defines a "business relationship" is adjusted from time to time. Our business is primarily based on 98 asset management distribution clients who, at December 31, 2018, had at least $5.0 million each in customer assets invested in our programs. We also had single-product relationships with 80 additional banks and trust institutions. The principal competitors for this business are: 

• | Russell Investment Group;


• | Fidelity Investments;


• | Franklin Templeton Investments;


• | discretionary portfolio managers; and


• | various multi-manager investment programs offered by other firms.

We also consider “in-house” proprietary asset management capabilities to be a form of long-term competition.
Investment Advisors
We are a leading provider of investment management solutions throughout the United States to registered investment advisors, financial planners and life insurance agents, many of whom are registered with independent broker-dealers. These solutions include SEI’s investment management platform and investment processing platform and are usually offered on a bundled basis. We also help advisors manage and grow their businesses by giving them access to marketing support programs and practice management services which include, for example, workflow recommendations, succession planning advice, business assessment assistance and recommended management practices. We believe our integrated solution helps investment advisors reduce risk, improve quality and gain operational efficiency which allows them to devote more of their resources to acquiring new clients and achieving better outcomes for their existing clients.
Advisors are responsible for the investor relationship which includes creating financial plans, implementing investment strategies and educating and servicing their customers. Advisors may customize portfolios to include separate account managers provided through our programs as well as SEI-sponsored mutual funds. Our wealth and investment programs are designed to be attractive to affluent or high-net-worth individual investors and small to medium-sized institutional retirement plans.
We continually evaluate and enhance our offering to meet the emerging needs of our advisors and their end clients. We anticipate the enhanced service offerings enabled through SWP will provide a more diverse range of back-office, front-office and client-facing investment processing and investment management capabilities. We began to implement selected groups of advisor clients onto SWP in 2015 and expect to have all clients on the platform in 2019. We will continue to focus on recruiting new advisors, improving net cash flows into our investment management programs, and managing client relationships toward eventual migration onto SWP.
We estimate we have business relationships with approximately 7,400 financial advisors at December 31, 2018. Our definition of a client for this segment includes financial advisors who have exceeded a minimal level of customer assets invested in our investment products. With the growth of our business, the minimal level of customer assets which defines a "business relationship" is adjusted from time to time. Our business is primarily based on approximately 2,100 investment advisors who, at December 31, 2018, had at least $5.0 million each in customer assets invested in our programs. Revenues are earned largely as a percentage of average assets under management.
The principal competition for our investment management products is from other active money managers, passive investment management sponsors, other turnkey asset management providers, mutual fund companies, custody service providers and the proprietary investment management programs of broker dealers. In the advisor distributor channel, the principal competitors include:

• | AssetMark Investment Services Inc.;


• | Brinker Capital;


• | EnvestNet, Inc.;


• | Fidelity Investments;


• | TD Ameritrade;

Page 7 of 86


• | Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.; and


• | other broker-dealers.

As we introduce SWP, we expect to more directly compete with custody service providers.
Institutional Investors
We are a leading provider of Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) platforms for retirement plan sponsors, healthcare systems, and not-for-profit organizations globally. We have a broadly experienced team with specific expertise in defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, endowments, foundations, balance sheet assets and other institutional asset pools.
Our clients benefit from solutions that combine the breadth of SEI’s investment management, advisory, and administration services. Depending on their needs, objectives, and risk tolerance, clients may elect to either retain control or outsource specific management functions. As a result, they are able to integrate SEI’s investment process, advisory services, and plan administration services into their existing best practices seamlessly. This approach is designed to address the investor’s specific risk-return requirements, reduce business risk, provide ongoing due diligence, and increase operational efficiency.
SEI’s open architecture investment management approach provides access to manager research, manager selection and monitoring, portfolio construction and discretionary management. Advisory services include scenario modeling and customization of an asset allocation plan that is designed to meet long-term objectives. Plan administration services include trustee, custodial, and benefit payment services.
We expect to continue our efforts to build a globally diversified institutional client base, provide our clients with value-added advice and discretionary services, and place increased emphasis on defined contribution and not-for-profit organizations fiduciary management sales opportunities.
Fees are primarily earned as a percentage of average assets under management calculated using the average of the four month ending balances preceding the billing date. At December 31, 2018, we had relationships with 482 institutional clients. The principal competitors for this segment are:

• | boutique and large bank OCIO/fiduciary management firms;


• | Mercer;


• | Aon Hewitt;


• | Willis Towers Watson; and


• | Russell Investments.

Investment Managers
We are a leading global provider of investment operations outsourcing platforms to fund companies, banking institutions, family offices and both traditional and alternative investment managers worldwide. We provide investment organizations and asset owners with the advanced operating infrastructure that is critical to success in this highly competitive industry while also providing solutions to efficiently navigate a host of ever changing and increasingly complex business and regulatory challenges. Our comprehensive global operating platform provides clients with customized and integrated capabilities in the areas of: 

• | data and information management;


• | investment operations;


• | risk management and compliance support;


• | fund administration;


• | fund accounting; and


• | distribution support.

We work with a diverse and sophisticated group of alternative, traditional, and hybrid asset managers, including approximately one-third of the top 100 managers worldwide. We believe clients choose our full-service offering because of its flexibility, quality and ability to support their diverse business needs across multiple product types and structures, investment strategies and asset classes. Our investment manager clients offer a variety of packaging types, including hedge funds, private equity and real estate funds, mutual funds, separate accounts, ETFs, UCITS and closed-end funds. For clients focused on the U.S. retirement market who desire to manage assets within a collective investment trust, we offer trustee and investment management services in addition to the aforementioned administration services. Our platform enables us to offer outsourcing services to a full spectrum of investment managers, accommodating the special needs of emerging and start-up managers all the way through to the most complex, multi-asset hybrid managers globally. Our operational platform enables managers to view 
Page 8 of 86

their business in a comprehensive and integrated way, providing more insight and thus control over their business risks and results.
We also provide a family office platform with a comprehensive suite of technology and technology-enabled services for ultra-high-net-worth families, their trusted advisors and the institutions that service the family office market.
Over the past few years, investors have faced multiple market disruptions and rising volatility. At the same time there has been an increased level of regulatory pressure focused on investor and data protection. Investment managers have responded with a range of innovative products designed to better manage volatility and downside risk, and many now offer alternatives to the pure long-only investing strategy historically used in traditional markets. This can be accomplished in a standalone private or public fund vehicle or using our U.S. mutual fund series trust platform. We also offer a regulatory compliance platform that assists managers in adhering to the changing and ever-demanding global regulatory environment. Additionally, as we believe that competitiveness will increasingly be based on capabilities other than just portfolio investment expertise, we offer managers solutions that help them gain scale and efficiency, run their businesses more intelligently through data analytics and online dashboards, and be more responsive to regulatory, investor and intermediary needs.
We will continue our efforts to add new asset managers, asset owners, family offices and private wealth advisors as clientele, grow our existing client relationships, expand into new markets and further develop our solutions and global operations platform.
Contracts for fund administration outsourcing services generally have terms ranging from three to five years. Fees are primarily earned as a percentage of average assets under management and administration. A portion of the revenues for this segment is earned as account servicing fees. At December 31, 2018, we had relationships with 486 investment management companies, alternative investment managers, family offices and private wealth advisors. Our competitors vary according to the asset class or solutions provided and include:

• | State Street;


• | BNY Mellon;


• | Northern Trust;


• | SS&C Technologies; and


• | Citco.

Investments in New Businesses
The Investments in New Businesses segment represents other business ventures or research and development activities intended to expand our solutions to new or existing markets including ultra-high-net-worth families who reside in the United States. This segment also includes the costs associated with developing internet-based investment services and advice solutions. The family wealth management solution offers flexible family-office type services through a highly personalized solution while utilizing a goals-based investment process.
The principal competitors for the family wealth solution are diversified financial services providers focused on the ultra-high-net-worth market.
Research and Development
We continue to devote significant resources to research and development, including expenditures for new technology platforms, enhancements to existing technology platforms and new investment products and services. Our research and development expenditures for the last three years were:
(all dollar amounts in thousands) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Research and development expenditures | $ | 159,084 | | | $ | 155,252 | | | $ | 134,323
Capitalization of costs incurred in developing computer software | $ | 44,221 | | | $ | 61,043 | | | $ | 50,392 
Research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenues | 9.8 | % | | 10.2 | % | | 9.6 | %

Our research and development expenditures are included in Compensation, benefits and other personnel and Consulting, outsourcing and professional fees on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The majority of our research and development spending is related to building SWP, which combines business service processing with asset management and distribution services. SWP offers a client-centric, rather than an account-centric, process 
Page 9 of 86

with model-based portfolio management services through a single platform. SWP utilizes SEI’s proprietary applications with those built by third-party providers and integrates them into a single technology platform. This integration supports straight-through business processing and enables the transformation of our clients’ wealth services from operational investment processing services to client value-added services.
SWP provides the technology infrastructure for the business solutions now being marketed and delivered to markets in the United States and the United Kingdom served by the Private Banks segment. SWP also provides the technology infrastructure for the business solutions now being marketed and delivered to markets in the United States served by the Investment Advisors segment. We believe the advanced capabilities of SWP will enable us to significantly extend and enhance the services we offer to clients and expand SEI’s addressable markets.
Marketing and Sales
Our business platforms are directly marketed to potential clients in our target markets. At January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 105 sales representatives who operate from offices located throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, South Africa, Asia and other locations.
Customers
In 2018, no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of revenues in any business segment.
Personnel
At January 31, 2019, we had 3,820 full-time and 32 part-time employees. Employee unions do not represent any of our employees. Management considers employee relations to be generally good.
Regulatory Considerations
We conduct our operations through several regulated wholly-owned subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are:

• | SEI Investments Distribution Co., or SIDCO, a broker-dealer registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA;


• | SEI Investments Management Corporation, or SIMC, an investment advisor registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, under the Commodity Exchange Act;


• | SEI Private Trust Company, or SPTC, a limited purpose federal thrift chartered and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency;


• | SEI Trust Company, or STC, a Pennsylvania trust company, regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities;


• | SEI Investments (Europe) Limited, or SIEL, an investment manager and financial institution subject to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom;


• | SEI Investments Canada Company, or SEI Canada, an investment fund manager that has various other capacities that is regulated by the Ontario Securities Commission and various provincial authorities;


• | SEI Investments Global, Limited, or SIGL, a management company for Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities, or UCITS, and for Alternative Investment Funds, or AIFs, that is regulated primarily by the Central Bank of Ireland, or CBI;


• | SEI Investments - Global Fund Services, Ltd., or GFSL, an authorized provider of administration services for Irish and non-Irish collective investment schemes that is regulated by the CBI; and


• | SEI Investments - Depositary and Custodial Services (Ireland) Limited, or D&C, an authorized provider of depositary and custodial services that is regulated by the CBI.

In addition to the regulatory authorities listed above, our subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities in other foreign countries. In addition to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we also own a minority interest of approximately 38.9 percent in LSV, which is also an investment advisor registered with the SEC.
The Company, its regulated subsidiaries, their regulated services and solutions and their customers are all subject to extensive legislation, regulation and supervision that recently has been subject to, and continues to experience, significant change and increased regulatory activity. These changes and regulatory activities could have a material adverse effect on us and our clients.
The various governmental agencies and self-regulatory authorities that regulate or supervise the Company and its subsidiaries have broad administrative powers. In the event of a failure to comply with laws, regulations and requirements of these agencies and authorities, the possible business process changes required or sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of 
Page  of 86

individual employees, limitations on our ability to engage in business for specified periods of time, the revocation of applicable registration as a broker-dealer, investment advisor or other regulated entity, and, as the case may be, censures and fines. Additionally, certain securities and banking laws applicable to us and our subsidiaries provide for certain private rights of action that could give rise to civil litigation. Any litigation could have significant financial and non-financial consequences including monetary judgments and the requirement to take action or limit activities that could ultimately affect our business.
Governmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies and law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to our regulated subsidiaries and their activities, services and solutions, our business practices, our past actions and other matters has increased dramatically in the past several years. Responding to these examinations, investigations, actions and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties, fines and changes to business processes sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years, and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to advance or support legislation targeted at the financial services industry. We continue to be subject to inquiries from examinations and investigations by supervisory and enforcement divisions of regulatory authorities and expect this to continue in the future. We believe this is also the case with many of our regulated clients. Governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our reputation, our relationship with clients and prospective clients, and on the morale and performance of our employees, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.
We are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires implementation of regulations applicable to financial services companies, including standards for verifying client identification and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside the United States contain similar requirements. We offer investment and banking solutions that also are subject to regulation by the federal and state securities and banking authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities, where applicable. Existing or future regulations that affect these solutions could lead to a reduction in sales of these solutions or require modifications of these solutions.
Compliance with existing and future regulations and responding to and complying with recent increased regulatory activity affecting broker-dealers, investment advisors, investment companies, financial institutions and their service providers could have a significant impact on us. We periodically undergo regulatory examinations and respond to regulatory inquiries and document requests. In addition, recent and continuing legislative activity in the United States and in other jurisdictions (including the European Union and the United Kingdom) have made and continue to make extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms. Recent changes include the effectiveness of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and pending effectiveness of the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and the U.S. Department of Labor's Fiduciary Rule. As a result of these examinations, inquiries and requests, as a result of increased civil litigation activity, and as a result of these new laws and regulations, we engage legal counsel and other subject matter experts, review our compliance procedures, solution and service offerings, and business operations, and make changes as we deem necessary or as may be required by the applicable authority. These additional activities and required changes may result in increased expense or may reduce revenues.
Our bank clients are subject to supervision by federal, state and foreign banking and financial services authorities concerning the manner in which such clients purchase and receive our products and services. Our plan sponsor clients and our subsidiaries providing services to those clients are subject to supervision by the Department of Labor and compliance with employee benefit regulations. Investment advisor and broker-dealer clients are regulated by the SEC, state securities authorities, or FINRA. Existing or future regulations applicable to our clients may affect our clients’ purchase of our products and services.
In addition, see the discussion of governmental regulations in Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a description of the risks that proposed regulatory changes may present for our business.
