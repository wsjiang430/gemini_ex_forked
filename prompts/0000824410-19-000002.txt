Market and Economic Overview
 Sandy Spring Bank is headquartered in Montgomery County, Maryland and conducts business primarily in Central Maryland, Northern Virginia and Washington D.C.  The Bank’s business footprint serves Greater Washington, which includes the District of Columbia proper, Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland, one of the country’s most economically successful regions. The region’s economic strength is due to the region’s significant federal government presence and the strong growth in the business and professional services sector. The proximity to numerous armed forces installations in Maryland, including the United States Cyber Command in Ft. Meade, Maryland, together with a strategic location between two of the country’s leading ports – the Port of Baltimore and the Port of Norfolk - its proximity to numerous interstates and railways have provided opportunities for growth in a variety of areas, including logistics and transportation. 
 
The region’s unemployment rate has remained below the national average for the last several years. This low unemployment is due primarily to the region’s highly trained and educated workforce. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the region is home to six of the top ten most highly educated counties in the nation and five of the top ten most affluent counties, as measured by household income. The Company’s geographical location provides access to key neighboring markets such as Philadelphia, New York City, Pittsburgh and the Richmond/Norfolk, Virginia corridor.

The local economy that the Company operates in continued to strengthen and expand throughout 2018.  While the economic improvement has resulted in many positive economic trends such as lower unemployment, high consumer confidence, increased housing starts and steady housing prices, these have been tempered by concerns such as the lack of wage growth, low inflation levels, the strength of the dollar and temporary government shutdowns.  Volatility in global economic markets, domestic political issues and various episodes of geo-political unrest continue to cause a degree of uncertainty in the financial markets.  Additionally, interest rate increases during 2018 have affected confidence among individual consumers and small and mid-sized businesses.   Management continues to be encouraged by the overall strength of the current economic environment and the prospects for continued growth of the Company.  
 
Loan Products
 The Company currently offers a complete menu of loan products primarily in the Company’s identified market footprint that are discussed in detail below and on the following pages.  These following sections should be read in conjunction with the section “Credit Risk” on page 49 of this report.
Residential Real Estate Loans 
 The residential real estate category contains loans principally to consumers secured by residential real estate. The Company's residential real estate lending policy requires each loan to have viable repayment sources. Residential real estate loans are evaluated for the adequacy of these repayment sources at the time of approval, based upon measures including credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and collateral values. Credit risk for residential real estate loans arises from borrowers lacking the ability or willingness to repay the loan or by a shortfall in the value of the residential real estate in relation to the outstanding loan balance in the event of a default and subsequent liquidation of the real estate collateral.  The residential real estate portfolio includes both conforming and non-conforming mortgage loans. 
 
Conforming mortgage loans represent loans originated in accordance with underwriting standards set forth by the government-sponsored entities (“GSEs”), including the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), and the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”), which serve as the primary purchasers of loans sold in the secondary mortgage market by mortgage lenders. These loans are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less or have mortgage insurance to insure down to 80%, and are made to borrowers in good credit standing. Substantially all fixed-rate conforming loans originated are sold in the secondary mortgage market. For any loans retained by the Company, title insurance insuring the priority of its mortgage lien, as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance protecting the properties securing the loans is required. Borrowers may be required to advance funds, with each monthly payment of principal and interest, to a loan escrow account from which the Company makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes and mortgage insurance premiums. Appraisers approved by the Company appraise the properties securing substantially all of the Company's residential mortgage loans.
 
Non-conforming mortgage loans represent loans that generally are not saleable in the secondary market to the GSEs for inclusion in conventional mortgage-backed securities due to the credit characteristics of the borrower, the underlying documentation, the loan-to-value ratio, or the size of the loan, among other factors. The Company originates non-conforming loans for its own portfolio and for sale to third-party investors, usually large mortgage companies, under commitments by the mortgage company to purchase the loans subject to compliance with pre-established investor criteria. Non-conforming loans generated for sale include loans that may not be underwritten using customary underwriting standards. These loans typically are held after funding for thirty days or less, and are included in residential mortgages held for sale.  The Company may sell both conforming and non-conforming loans on either a servicing released or servicing retained basis.  
 
The Company makes residential real estate development and construction loans generally to provide interim financing on property during the development and construction period. Borrowers include builders, developers and persons who will ultimately occupy the single-family dwelling. Residential real estate development and construction loan funds are disbursed periodically as pre-specified stages of completion are attained based upon site inspections. Interest rates on these loans are usually adjustable.  Loans to individuals for the construction of primary personal residences are typically secured by the property under construction, frequently include additional collateral (such as a second mortgage on the borrower's present home), and commonly have maturities of twelve to eighteen months. The Company attempts to obtain the permanent mortgage loan under terms, conditions and documentation standards that permit the sale of the mortgage loan in the secondary mortgage loan market.

Commercial Loans
 Included in this category are commercial real estate loans, commercial construction loans and other commercial loans. The Company’s commercial loan clients represent a diverse cross-section of small to mid-size local businesses within the Company’s market footprint, whose owners and employees are often established Bank customers. Such banking relationships are a natural business for the Company, with its long-standing community roots and extensive experience in serving and lending to this market segment.
 
Commercial loans are evaluated for the adequacy of repayment sources at the time of approval and are regularly reviewed for any possible deterioration in the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. Collateral generally is required to provide the Company with an additional source of repayment in the event of default by a commercial borrower. The structure of the collateral package, including the type and amount of the collateral, varies from loan to loan depending on the financial strength of the borrower, the amount and terms of the loan, and the collateral available to be pledged by the borrower, but generally may include real estate, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets. Loans also may be supported by personal guarantees from the principals of the commercial loan borrowers.  The financial condition and cash flow of commercial borrowers are closely monitored by the submission of corporate financial statements, personal financial statements and income tax returns. The frequency of submissions of required information depends upon the size and complexity of the credit and the collateral that secures the loan.  Credit risk for commercial loans arises from borrowers lacking the ability or willingness to repay the loan, and in the case of secured loans, by a shortfall in the collateral value in relation to the outstanding loan balance in the event of a default and subsequent liquidation of collateral. The Company has no commercial loans to borrowers in similar industries that exceed 10% of total loans. 
 
Included in commercial loans are credits directly originated by the Company and, to a lesser extent, syndicated transactions or loan participations that are originated by other lenders. The Company's commercial lending policy requires each loan, regardless of whether it is directly originated or is purchased, to have viable repayment sources. The risks associated with syndicated loans or purchased participations are similar to those of directly originated commercial loans, although additional risk may arise from the limited ability to control actions of the primary lender.  Shared National Credits (SNC), as defined by the banking regulatory agencies, represent syndicated lending arrangements with three or more participating financial institutions and credit exceeding $100.0 million in the aggregate. At December 31, 2018, the Company had no outstanding SNC purchases or SNC sold.
 
The Company sells participations in loans it originates to other financial institutions in order to build long-term customer relationships or limit loan concentration. The Company also purchases whole loans and loan participations as part of its asset/liability management strategy. Strict policies are in place governing the degree of risk assumed and volume of loans held. At December 31, 2018, other financial institutions had $71.8 million in outstanding commercial and commercial real estate loan participations sold by the Company. In addition, the Company had $54.0 million in outstanding commercial and commercial real estate loan participations purchased from other lenders. 
 
The Company's commercial real estate loans consist of both loans secured by owner occupied properties and non-owner occupied properties where an established banking relationship exists and involves investment properties for warehouse, retail, and office space with a history of occupancy and cash flow. The commercial real estate categories contain mortgage loans to developers and owners of commercial real estate. Commercial real estate loans are governed by the same lending policies and subject to credit risk as previously described for commercial loans. Commercial real estate loans secured by owner-occupied properties are based upon the borrower’s financial condition and the ability of the borrower and the business to repay. The Company seeks to reduce the risks associated with commercial mortgage lending by generally lending in its market area, using conservative loan-to-value ratios and obtaining periodic financial statements and tax returns from borrowers to perform loan reviews. It is also the Company's general policy to obtain personal guarantees from the principals of the borrowers and to underwrite the business entity from a cash flow perspective. Interest rate risks are mitigated by using either floating interest rates or by fixing rates for a short period of time, generally less than three years.  While loan amortizations may be approved for up to 300 months, each loan generally has a call provision (maturity date) of five to ten years or less.

The Company primarily lends for commercial construction in local markets that are familiar and understandable, works selectively with top-quality builders and developers, and requires substantial equity from its borrowers.  The underwriting process is designed to confirm that the project will be economically feasible and financially viable; it is generally evaluated as though the Company will provide permanent financing. The Company's portfolio growth objectives do not include speculative commercial construction projects or projects lacking reasonable proportionate sharing of risk. Development and construction loans are secured by the properties under development or construction, and personal guarantees are typically obtained. Further, to assure that reliance is not placed solely upon the value of the underlying collateral, the Company considers the financial condition and reputation of the borrower and any guarantors, the amount of the borrower's equity in the project, independent appraisals, cost estimates and pre-construction sales information. A risk rating system is used on the commercial loan portfolio to determine any exposures to losses.
 
Acquisition, development and construction loans (“AD&C loans”) to residential builders are generally made for the construction of residential homes for which a binding sales contract exists and the prospective buyers had been pre-qualified for permanent mortgage financing by either third-party lenders (mortgage companies or other financial institutions) or the Company.  Loans for the development of residential land are extended when evidence is provided that the lots under development will be or have been sold to builders satisfactory to the Company. These loans are generally extended for a period of time sufficient to allow for the clearing and grading of the land and the installation of water, sewer and roads, which is typically a minimum of eighteen months to three years.
 
The Company also originates commercial business loans. Commercial term loans are made to provide funds for equipment and general corporate needs.  This loan category is designed to support borrowers who have a proven ability to service debt over a term generally not to exceed 84 months.  The Company generally requires a first lien position on all collateral and requires guarantees from owners having at least a 10% interest in the involved business.  Interest rates on commercial term loans are generally floating or fixed for a term not to exceed five years.  Management monitors industry and collateral concentrations to avoid loan exposures to a large group of similar industries or similar collateral. Commercial business loans are evaluated for historical and projected cash flow attributes, balance sheet strength, and primary and alternate resources of personal guarantors.  Commercial term loan documents require borrowers to forward regular financial information on both the business and personal guarantors. Loan covenants require at least annual submission of complete financial information and in certain cases this information is required monthly, quarterly or semi-annually depending on the degree to which the Company desires information resources for monitoring a borrower’s financial condition and compliance with loan covenants.  Examples of properly margined collateral for loans, as required by bank policy, would be a 75% advance on the lesser of appraisal or recent sales price on commercial property, an 80% or less advance on eligible receivables, a 50% or less advance on eligible inventory and an 80% advance on appraised residential property. Collateral borrowing certificates may be required to monitor certain collateral categories on a monthly or quarterly basis. Loans may require personal guarantees.  Key person life insurance may be required as appropriate and as necessary to mitigate the risk of loss of a primary owner or manager. Whenever appropriate and available, the Bank seeks governmental loan guarantees, such as the Small Business Administration loan programs, to reduce risks.
 
Commercial lines of credit are granted to finance a business borrower’s short-term credit needs and/or to finance a percentage of eligible receivables and inventory.  In addition to the risks inherent in term loan facilities, line of credit borrowers typically require additional monitoring to protect the lender against increasing loan volumes and diminishing collateral values.  Commercial lines of credit are generally revolving in nature and require close scrutiny.  The Company generally requires at least an annual out of debt period (for seasonal borrowers) or regular financial information (monthly or quarterly financial statements, borrowing base certificates, etc.) for borrowers with more growth and greater permanent working capital financing needs.  Advances against collateral value are limited.  Lines of credit and term loans to the same borrowers generally are cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized.  Interest rate charges on this group of loans generally float at a factor at or above the prime lending rate.
 
Consumer Loans
 Consumer lending continues to be important to the Company’s full-service, community banking business.  This category of loans includes primarily home equity loans and lines, installment loans and personal lines of credit.  
 
 7
 
  
The home equity category consists mainly of revolving lines of credit to consumers that are secured by residential real estate. Home equity lines of credit and other home equity loans are originated by the Company for typically up to 85% of the appraised value, less the amount of any existing prior liens on the property. While home equity loans have maximum terms of up to twenty years and interest rates are generally fixed, home equity lines of credit have maximum terms of up to ten years for draws and thirty years for repayment, and interest rates are generally adjustable. The Company secures these loans with mortgages on the homes (typically a second mortgage). Purchase money second mortgage loans originated by the Company have maximum terms ranging from ten to thirty years. These loans generally carry a fixed rate of interest for a term of 15 or 20 years. ARM loans have a 30 year amortization period with a fixed rate of interest for the first five, seven or ten years, re-pricing annually thereafter at a predetermined spread to LIBOR. Home equity lines are generally governed by the same lending policies and subject to the same credit risk as described for residential real estate loans.
 
Other consumer loans include installment loans used by customers to purchase automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. These consumer loans are generally governed by the same overall lending policies as described for residential real estate loans. Credit risk for consumer loans arises from borrowers lacking the ability or willingness to repay the loan, and in the case of secured loans, by a shortfall in the value of the collateral in relation to the outstanding loan balance in the event of a default and subsequent liquidation of collateral.  
 
Consumer installment loans are generally offered for terms of up to six years at fixed interest rates.  Automobile loans can be for up to 100% of the purchase price or the retail value listed by the National Automobile Dealers Association. The terms of the loans are determined by the age and condition of the collateral. Collision insurance policies are required on all these loans, unless the borrower has substantial other assets and income. The Company also makes other consumer loans, which may or may not be secured. The term of the loans usually depends on the collateral. The majority of outstanding unsecured loans usually do not exceed $50 thousand and have a term of no longer than 36 months.
 
Deposit Activities
 Subject to the Company’s Asset/Liability Committee (the “ALCO”) policies and current business plan, the Treasury function works closely with the Company’s retail deposit operations to accomplish the objectives of maintaining deposit market share within the Company’s primary markets and managing funding costs to preserve the net interest margin.
 
One of the Company’s primary objectives as a community bank is to develop long-term, multi-product customer relationships from its comprehensive menu of financial products. To that end, the lead product to develop such relationships is typically a deposit product. The Company intends to rely primarily on core deposit growth to fund long-term loan growth. 
 
Treasury Activities
 The Treasury function manages the wholesale segments of the balance sheet, including investments, purchased funds and long-term debt, and is responsible for all facets of interest rate risk management for the Company, which includes the pricing of deposits consistent with conservative interest rate risk and liquidity practices. Management’s objective is to achieve the maximum level of consistent earnings over the long term, while minimizing interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk and optimizing capital utilization. In managing the investment portfolio under its stated objectives, the Company invests primarily in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S Agency mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities (“MBS”), U.S. Agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (“CMO”), municipal bonds and, to a minimal extent, trust preferred securities and corporate bonds. Treasury strategies and activities are overseen by the Risk Committee of the board of directors, ALCO and the Company’s Investment Committee, which reviews all investment and funding transactions. The ALCO activities are summarized and reviewed quarterly with the Company’s board of directors.
 
The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to provide the necessary liquidity consistent with anticipated levels of deposit funding and loan demand with a minimal level of risk. The overall average duration of 3.9 years of the investment portfolio together with the types of investments (97% of the portfolio is rated AA or above) is intended to provide sufficient cash flows to support the Company’s lending goals. Liquidity is also provided by secured lines of credit maintained with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”), the Federal Reserve, and to a lesser extent, unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks.

Borrowing Activities
 Management utilizes a variety of sources to raise borrowed funds at competitive rates, including federal funds purchased, FHLB borrowings, retail repurchase agreements and subordinated debentures. FHLB borrowings typically carry rates at varying spreads from the LIBOR rate or treasury yield curve for the equivalent term because they may be secured with investments or high quality loans. Federal funds purchased, which are generally overnight borrowings, are typically purchased at the Federal Reserve target rate.  The subordinated debentures were assumed as part of the WashingtonFirst acquisition and qualify for regulatory capital treatment.
 
The Company’s borrowing activities are achieved through the use of the previously mentioned lines of credit to address overnight and short-term funding needs, match-fund loan activity and, when opportunities are present, to lock in attractive rates due to market conditions.
 
Employees
 The Company and its subsidiaries employed 932 persons, including executive officers, loan and other banking and trust officers, branch personnel, and others at December 31, 2018. None of the Company's employees is represented by a union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. Management of the Company considers its employee relations to be excellent.
Competition
 The Bank's principal competitors for deposits are other financial institutions, including other banks, credit unions, and savings institutions located in the Bank’s primary market area of central Maryland, Northern Virginia and Washington D.C. Competition among these institutions is based primarily on interest rates and other terms offered, product offerings, service charges imposed on deposit accounts, the quality of services rendered, and the convenience of banking facilities. Additional competition for depositors' funds comes from mutual funds, U.S. Government securities, and private issuers of debt obligations and suppliers of other investment alternatives for depositors such as securities firms. Competition from credit unions has intensified in recent years as historical federal limits on membership have been relaxed. Because federal law subsidizes credit unions by giving them a general exemption from federal income taxes, credit unions have a significant cost advantage over banks and savings associations, which are fully subject to federal income taxes. Credit unions may use this advantage to offer rates that are highly competitive with those offered by banks and thrifts.
 
The banking business in Central Maryland, Northern Virginia and Washington D.C. generally, and the Bank's primary service areas specifically, are highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits. As noted above, the Bank competes with many larger banking organizations that have offices over a wide geographic area. These larger institutions have certain inherent advantages, such as the ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and promotions and to allocate their investment assets to regions offering the highest yield and demand. They also offer services, such as international banking, that are not offered directly by the Bank (but are available indirectly through correspondent institutions), and, by virtue of their larger total capitalization, such banks have substantially higher legal lending limits, which are based on bank capital, than does the Bank. The Bank can arrange loans in excess of its lending limit, or in excess of the level of risk it desires to take, by arranging participations with other banks.  The primary factors in competing for loans are interest rates, loan origination fees, and the range of services offered by lenders. Competitors for loan originations include other commercial banks, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, savings associations, and insurance companies. 
 
Sandy Spring Insurance Corporation (“SSIC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, offers annuities as an alternative to traditional deposit accounts. SSIC operates Sandy Spring Insurance, a general insurance agency located in Annapolis, Maryland, and Neff & Associates, an insurance agency located in Ocean City, Maryland.  Both agencies face competition primarily from other insurance agencies and insurance companies.  West Financial Services, Inc. (“WFS”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, is an asset management and financial planning company located in McLean, Virginia.  The competition that WFS faces is primarily from other financial planners, banks, and financial management companies. 
 
In addition to competing with other commercial banks, credit unions and savings associations, commercial banks such as the Bank compete with non-bank institutions for funds. For instance, yields on corporate and government debt and equity securities affect the ability of commercial banks to attract and hold deposits. Mutual funds also provide substantial competition to banks for deposits.  Other entities, both governmental and in private industry, raise capital through the issuance and sale of debt and equity securities and indirectly compete with the Bank in the acquisition of deposits.

Financial holding companies may engage in banking as well as types of securities, insurance, and other financial activities.  Banks with or without holding companies also may establish and operate financial subsidiaries that may engage in most financial activities in which financial holding companies may engage. Competition may increase as bank holding companies and other large financial services companies expand their operations to engage in new activities and provide a wider array of products.
 
Monetary Policy
 The Company and the Bank are affected by fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, including those of the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the national money supply in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures. Among the techniques available to the Federal Reserve Board are engaging in open market transactions of U.S. Government securities, changing the discount rate and changing reserve requirements against bank deposits. These techniques are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The effect of governmental policies on the earnings of the Company and the Bank cannot be predicted.
Regulation, Supervision, and Governmental Policy
 The following is a brief summary of certain statutes and regulations that significantly affect the Company and the Bank. A number of other statutes and regulations may affect the Company and the Bank but are not discussed in the following paragraphs.
Bank Holding Company Regulation
 The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the Holding Company Act and, as such, is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve. As a bank holding company, the Company is required to furnish to the Federal Reserve annual and quarterly reports of its operations and additional information and reports. The Company is also subject to regular examination by the Federal Reserve.
 
Under the Holding Company Act, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (1) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any class of voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the class; (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.
 
Prior to acquiring control of the Company or the Bank, any company must obtain approval of the Federal Reserve. For purposes of the Holding Company Act, "control" is defined as ownership of 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company or the Bank, the ability to control the election of a majority of the directors, or the exercise of a controlling influence over management or policies of the Company or the Bank.
 
The Holding Company Act also limits the investments and activities of bank holding companies. In general, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, providing services for its subsidiaries, non-bank activities that are closely related to banking, and other financially related activities. The activities of the Company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the Holding Company Act and Federal Reserve regulations.
 
The Change in Bank Control Act and the related regulations of the Federal Reserve require any person or persons acting in concert (except for companies required to make application under the Holding Company Act) to file a written notice with the Federal Reserve before the person or persons acquire control of the Company or the Bank. The Change in Bank Control Act defines "control" as the direct or indirect power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities or to direct the management or policies of a bank holding company or an insured bank.
 
In general, bank holding companies that qualify as financial holding companies under federal banking law may engage in an expanded list of non-bank activities. Non-bank and financially related activities of bank holding companies, including companies that become financial holding companies, also may be subject to regulation and oversight by regulators other than the Federal Reserve. The Company is not a financial holding company, but may choose to become one in the future.
 
 10
 
  
The Federal Reserve has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity, or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company.
 
The Federal Reserve has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies, which require bank holding companies to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total average assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. See "Regulatory Capital Requirements."
 
The Federal Reserve has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve's view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company's net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition.
 
Bank Regulation
 The Bank is a state chartered bank and trust company subject to supervision by the State of Maryland.  As a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is also subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve.  Deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC to the legal maximum. Deposits, reserves, investments, loans, consumer law compliance, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches, mergers and acquisitions, corporate activities, changes in control, electronic funds transfers, responsiveness to community needs, management practices, compensation policies, and other aspects of operations are subject to regulation by the appropriate federal and state supervisory authorities. In addition, the Bank is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations which set forth specific restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to extensions of credit (including to insiders), credit practices, disclosure of credit terms and discrimination in credit transactions.
 
The Federal Reserve regularly examines the operations and condition of the Bank, including, but not limited to, its capital adequacy, reserves, loans, investments, and management practices. These examinations are for the protection of the Bank's depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. In addition, the Bank is required to furnish quarterly and annual reports to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve's enforcement authority includes the power to remove officers and directors and the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders to prevent a bank from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or violating laws or regulations governing its business.
 
The Federal Reserve has adopted regulations regarding capital adequacy, which require member banks to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total average assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. See "Regulatory Capital Requirements." Federal Reserve and State regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. See “Note 12 –Stockholders’ Equity” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
The Bank is subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other transactions with, the Company and other affiliates, and on investments in their stock or other securities. These restrictions prevent the Company and the Bank's other affiliates from borrowing from the Bank unless the loans are secured by specified collateral, and require those transactions to have terms comparable to terms of arms-length transactions with third parties. In addition, secured loans and other transactions and investments by the Bank are generally limited in amount as to the Company and as to any other affiliate to 10% of the Bank's capital and surplus and as to the Company and all other affiliates together to an aggregate of 20% of the Bank's capital and surplus. Certain exemptions to these limitations apply to extensions of credit and other transactions between the Bank and its subsidiaries. These regulations and restrictions may limit the Company's ability to obtain funds from the Bank for its cash needs, including funds for acquisitions and for payment of dividends, interest, and operating expenses.
 
 11
 
  
Under Federal Reserve regulations, banks must adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards; prudent underwriting standards, including loan-to-value limits, that are clear and measurable; loan administration procedures; and documentation, approval, and reporting requirements. A bank's real estate lending policy must reflect consideration of the Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies (the "Interagency Guidelines") adopted by the federal bank regulators. The Interagency Guidelines, among other things, call for internal loan-to-value limits for real estate loans that are not in excess of the limits specified in the guidelines. The Interagency Guidelines state, however, that it may be appropriate in individual cases to originate or purchase loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits.
 
Sandy Spring Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned. Assessment rates currently range from 1.5 to 30 basis points. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.  Deposit insurance assessments are based on total assets less tangible equity.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
 
Regulatory Capital Requirements
 The Federal Reserve establishes capital and leverage requirements for the Company and the Bank. Specifically, the Company and the Bank are subject to the following minimum capital requirements: (1) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (2) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and (4) a leverage ratio of 4%. 
 
The Company’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital consists solely of common stock plus related surplus and retained earnings, adjusted for goodwill, intangible assets and the related deferred taxes. Additional Tier 1 capital may include other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, if applicable. Capital rules also permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but not in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, subject to certain restrictions. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that previously qualified in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rule has disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. 
 
In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a "capital conservation buffer" on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements.  Beginning January 2019, this buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity and the buffer applies to all three measurements: Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital. 
 
Supervision and Regulation of Mortgage Banking Operations
 The Company's mortgage banking business is subject to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), the Veterans' Administration ("VA") and Fannie Mae with respect to originating, processing, selling and servicing mortgage loans. Those rules and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines, which include provisions for inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective borrowers, and fix maximum loan amounts. Lenders such as the Company are required annually to submit audited financial statements to Fannie Mae, FHA and VA. Each of these regulatory entities has its own financial requirements. The Company's affairs are also subject to examination by the Federal Reserve, Fannie Mae, FHA and VA at all times to assure compliance with the applicable regulations, policies and procedures. Mortgage origination activities are subject to, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Fair Housing Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and related regulations that prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit terms and settlement costs. The Company's mortgage banking operations also are affected by various state and local laws and regulations and the requirements of various private mortgage investors.

Community Reinvestment
 Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of the entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods.  The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, or limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community.  However, institutions are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities.  Performance is tested in three areas: (a) lending, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its assessment areas; (b) investment, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and (c) service, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices.  The CRA requires each federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a financial institution, to assess and assign one of four ratings to the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of the community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution, including applications for charters, branches and other deposit facilities, relocations, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities, and savings and loan holding company acquisitions.  The CRA also requires that all institutions make public disclosure of their CRA ratings.  The Bank was assigned an “outstanding” rating as a result of its last CRA examination.
Bank Secrecy Act
 Under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the United States Treasury. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA, or has no lawful purpose. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the "USA Patriot Act" or the "Patriot Act”, enacted prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards intended to prevent the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Patriot Act requires banks and other depository institutions, brokers, dealers and certain other businesses involved in the transfer of money to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements meeting minimum standards specified by the act, to follow standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and to compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations and money launderers. The Patriot Act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) established a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures intended to increase corporate responsibility and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws. The Company is subject to Sarbanes-Oxley because it is required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley, its implementing regulations and related Nasdaq Stock Market rules have established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for the Company’s audit committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between the Company and its outside auditors (including restrictions on the types of non-audit services the auditors may provide to the Company), imposed additional financial statement certification responsibilities for the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, expanded the disclosure requirements for corporate insiders, required management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting, and required the Company’s auditors to issue a report on its internal control over financial reporting.
 
Regulatory Restructuring Legislation
The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, implements significant changes to the regulation of depository institutions.  The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve to take over the implementation of federal consumer financial protection and fair lending laws from the depository institution regulators.  However, institutions of $10 billion or fewer in assets continue to be examined for compliance with such laws and regulations by, and to be subject to the primary enforcement authority of, their primary federal regulator.  In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, requires changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance, requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans, directs the Federal Reserve to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees, and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage originations.

Other Laws and Regulations
 Some of the aspects of the lending and deposit business of the Bank that are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC include reserve requirements and disclosure requirements in connection with personal and mortgage loans and deposit accounts.  In addition, the Bank is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations that include specific restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to the establishment of branches, investments, interest rates on loans, credit practices, the disclosure of credit terms, and discrimination in credit transactions.
Enforcement Actions
 Federal statutes and regulations provide financial institution regulatory agencies with great flexibility to undertake an enforcement action against an institution that fails to comply with regulatory requirements.  Possible enforcement actions range from the imposition of a capital plan and capital directive to civil money penalties, cease-and-desist orders, receivership, conservatorship, or the termination of the deposit insurance.
