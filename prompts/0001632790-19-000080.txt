Narrative Description of the Business
Our Products
Energizer offers batteries using many technologies including lithium, alkaline, carbon zinc, nickel metal hydride, zinc air, and silver oxide. These products are sold under the Energizer and Eveready brands, and the acquisition of the global battery, lighting and portable power business (Battery Acquisition) from Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (Spectrum) added the Rayovac® brand globally and the Varta® brand in Latin America and Asia Pacific, as well as Rayovac-branded hearing aid batteries sold globally. These products include primary, rechargeable, specialty and hearing aid batteries and are offered in the performance, premium and price segments.
In addition, we offer an extensive line of lighting products designed to meet a variety of consumer needs. We manufacture, distribute, and market lighting products including headlights, lanterns, children’s lights and area lights. In addition to the Energizer, Eveready and Rayovac brands, we market our flashlights under the Hard Case®, Dolphin®, and WeatherReady® sub-brands. In addition to batteries and portable lights, Energizer licenses the Energizer and Eveready brands to companies developing consumer solutions in gaming, automotive batteries, portable power for critical devices (like smart phones), generators, power tools, household light bulbs and other lighting products.
In addition, we offer auto care products in the appearance, fragrance, performance and air conditioning recharge product categories. The appearance and fragrance categories include protectants, wipes, tire and wheel care products, glass cleaners, leather 
care products, air fresheners and washes designed to clean, shine, refresh and protect interior and exterior automobile surfaces under the brand names Armor All, Nu Finish®, Refresh Your Car!®, LEXOL®, Eagle One®, California Scents®, Driven® and Bahama & Co.®
The performance product category includes STP®-branded fuel and oil additives, functional fluids and other performance chemical products that benefit from a rich heritage in the car enthusiast and racing scenes, characterized by a commitment to technology, performance and motor sports partnerships for over 60 years. The brand equity of STP also provides for attractive licensing opportunities that augment our presence in our core performance categories. 
The air conditioning recharge product category includes do-it-yourself automotive air conditioning recharge products led by the A/C PRO® brand name, along with other refrigerant and recharge kits, sealants and accessories. 
Additional Information about our products can be found in the MD&A and Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our Industry
              We are a branded manufacturing and distribution company that markets and sells in the battery, lights and auto care categories.  These categories are highly competitive, both in the U.S. and on a global basis. We invest in our brands and innovation to meet the needs of consumers, and with our large global footprint, we both manufacture and source our products. Competition within our categories is based upon brand perceptions, product performance, price, retail execution and customer service. Key drivers of the battery business are device technology, consumer demographics and disasters. Competition in this category remains aggressive in the U.S. and other markets and could continue to put additional pressure on our results going forward, particularly as consumers shift consumption between channels such as e-commerce and discounters.
Sales and Distribution
We distribute our products to consumers through numerous retail locations worldwide, including mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, food, drug and convenience stores, electronics specialty stores and department stores, hardware and automotive centers, e-commerce and military stores. Although a large percentage of our sales are attributable to a relatively small number of retail customers, in fiscal year 2019, only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for ten percent or more (13.8%) of the Company's annual sales. 
Our products are marketed primarily through a direct sales force, but also through exclusive and non-exclusive distributors and wholesalers. Our products are sold through both “modern” and “traditional” trade. “Modern” trade, which is most prevalent in North America, Western Europe, and more developed economies throughout the world, generally refers to sales through large retailers with nationally or regionally recognized brands. “Traditional” trade, which is more common in developing markets in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, generally refers to sales by wholesalers or small retailers who may not have a national or regional presence.

Additional Information can be found in the MD&A and Notes 2 and 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used by Energizer in the production of batteries and lighting products include electrolytic manganese dioxide, zinc, silver, nickel, lithium, graphite, steel, plastic, brass wire, and potassium hydroxide. The prices and availability of these raw materials have fluctuated over time. The principal raw material used by auto care is refrigerant R-134a. We believe that adequate supplies of the raw materials required for all of our operations are available at the present time, although we cannot predict their future availability or prices. These raw materials are generally available from a number of different sources, and the prices of those raw materials are susceptible to currency fluctuations and price fluctuations due to supply and demand, transportation, government regulations, price controls, tariffs, economic climate, or other unforeseen circumstances. In the past, we have not experienced any significant interruption in availability of raw materials. We believe we have extensive experience in purchasing raw materials in the commodity markets. From time to time, our management has purchased materials or entered into forward commitments for raw materials to assure supply and to protect margins on anticipated sales volume.
Our Trademarks, Patents and Technology
Our ability to compete effectively in the battery, auto care and portable lighting categories depends, in part, on our ability to protect our brands and maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and manufacturing processes through a combination of trademark, patent and trade secret protection. We own thousands of Energizer, Rayovac, Varta and Eveready trademarks globally, which we consider to be of substantial importance and which are used individually or in conjunction with other sub-brand names. 
The number of Energizer, Rayovac, Varta, Eveready, Energizer Bunny design, and Mr. Energizer design trademarks, including related designs, slogans and sub-brands, is currently over 2,900 worldwide.
In our auto care business, we also have the Refresh Your Car!, California Scents, Driven, Bahama & Co., LEXOL, Eagle One, Armor All, STP, Tuff Stuff, Kent Car Care, A/C Pro and the Nu Finish trademarks. The number of trademarks making up the total of the auto care trademark portfolio globally, including related designs, slogans, and sub-brands, is currently over 1,400 worldwide.
We also own a number of patents, patent applications and other technology that relate primarily to battery, lighting and automotive fragrance, performance and appearance products, which we believe are significant to our business.
Seasonality
Sales and operating profit for our business tends to be seasonal, with increased purchases by consumers and increases in retailer inventories occurring for batteries during our fiscal first quarter and for automotive fragrance, appearance, performance and air conditioning recharge products during our fiscal second and third quarters. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes can create conditions that drive short-term increases in the need for portable power and lighting products and thereby increase our battery and flashlight sales. As a result of this seasonality, our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate throughout the year. 
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, we have approximately 7,500 employees, including approximately 2,450 employees based in the U.S. and 1,300 employees employed by the Varta consumer battery business in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, including manufacturing and distribution facilities in Germany (Divestment Business) that we have agreed to sell to VARTA Aktiengesellschaft (VARTA AG). Roughly 415 employees are unionized, primarily at our Fennimore, Wisconsin, Portage, Wisconsin and Marietta, Ohio facilities. Overall, we consider our employee relations to be good.
 Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, foreign and jurisdiction laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. Additional Information can be found in the MD&A and Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
