  ITEM 1.
 BUSINESS

 
  Company Overview
  
 Blue Dolphin Energy Company is a publicly-traded Delaware corporation formed in 1986, that is primarily engaged in the refining and marketing of petroleum products. We also provide tolling and storage terminaling services. Our assets, which are in Nixon, Texas, primarily include a 15,000-bpd crude distillation tower and approximately 1.1 million bbls of petroleum storage tank capacity (collectively the “Nixon Facility”). Pipeline transportation and oil and gas operations are no longer active. Blue Dolphin maintains a website at  http://www.blue-dolphin-energy.com. Information on or accessible through Blue Dolphin’s website is not incorporated by reference in or otherwise made a part of this Annual Report.
 Structure and Management
  
  Corporate Structure
  
 Blue Dolphin has two (2) business segments – Refinery Operations and Tolling and Terminaling, both of which are conducted at the Nixon Facility through the below active subsidiaries:
 Refinery Operations
  
   ●
 Lazarus Energy, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“LE”).

 
  Tolling and Terminaling
  
   ●
 Lazarus Refining & Marketing, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“LRM”).

 Management
  
 Blue Dolphin is controlled by LEH. LEH operates and manages all Blue Dolphin properties pursuant to an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Operating Agreement”). Jonathan Carroll is Chairman of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), Chief Executive Officer, and President of Blue Dolphin, as well as a majority owner of LEH. Together LEH and Jonathan Carroll owned 79.8% of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock) at December 31, 2018. (See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (9) Related-Party Transactions, Note (11) Long-Term Debt, Net and Note (19) Commitments and Contingencies – Financing Agreements” for additional disclosures related to LEH, the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, and Jonathan Carroll.)
 Going Concern
  
 See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (1) Organization – Going Concern” regarding factors that management has determined raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 Operating Risks
  
 See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (1) Organization – Operating Risks” regarding factors that management has determined represent operating risks.
   Business Strategy
  
  Management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to consecutive net losses, inadequate working capital, the Final Arbitration Award, and defaults under secured loan agreements. In 2018, our focus was on improving our financial stability and increasing utilization of existing assets while controlling costs, operating safely, and using environmentally appropriate operating practices. Management believes that it is continuing to take the appropriate steps. Actions to date include:
  
   ●
 Settlement Agreement with GEL. LE, NPS, and Blue Dolphin, together with LEH, Carroll & Company Financial Holdings, L.P. (“C&C”), and Jonathan Carroll (collectively referred to herein as the “Lazarus Parties”), entered into that certain Settlement Agreement with GEL Tex Marketing, LLC (“GEL”), dated as of July 20, 2018 (as may be further amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Settlement Agreement”), whereby GEL and the Lazarus Paties agreed to mutually release all claims against each other and to file a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice in connection with the GEL Arbitration (the “Settlement”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement is conditioned upon payment by the Lazarus Parties to GEL of $10.0 million in cash (the “Settlement Payment”). Until either the Settlement Payment is made or the Settlement Agreement is terminated, the Lazarus Parties must pay GEL $0.5 million in cash at the end of each calendar month (the “Interim Payments”). At December 31, 2018 and 2017, accrued arbitration award payable on our consolidated balance sheet was $21.1 million and $27.1 million, respectively. As of the date of this Annual Report, LE has paid $11.7 million to GEL towards reducing the outstanding balance of the Final Arbitration Award.

 
   ●
 Operational Improvements. We made a number of operational improvements, including: (i) selling certain of our refined petroleum products immediately following production, which minimizes inventory, improves cash flow, and reduces commodity risk/exposure, (ii) decreasing costs, reducing inventory levels, improving our sales cycle, and receiving pre-payments from certain customers, all of which reduced our working capital requirements, and (ii) implementing short-term, evergreen contracts with customers to limit commodity exposure.

 
  Successful execution of our business strategy depends on several key factors, including Settlement with GEL, having adequate working capital, obtaining credit to meet operational and regulatory requirements, maintaining safe and reliable operations at the Nixon Facility, meeting contractual obligations, and having favorable margins on refined petroleum products. Our results of operations and liquidity are highly dependent upon the margins that we receive for our refined petroleum products. The dollar per bbl price difference between crude oil and condensate (input) and refined petroleum products (output) is the most significant driver of refining margins, and they have historically been subject to wide fluctuations.

  There can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful, that LEH and its affiliates will continue to fund our working capital needs, that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that margins for refined petroleum products will be favorable. Veritex Community Bank (“Veritex”), as first lien holder in secured loan agreements, has been working with LE and LRM and continues to be aware and party to all discussions and arrangements with GEL surrounding the Settlement. However, if Veritex does not approve the Settlement or exercises its rights and remedies under secured loan agreements or the Settlement Agreement with GEL is terminated and GEL seeks to confirm and enforce the Final Arbitration Award, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected, and Blue Dolphin would likely be required to seek protection under bankruptcy laws.
  
  See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (1) Organization – Going Concern” for additional disclosures related to the Final Arbitration Award, the Settlement Agreement with GEL (as amended), defaults under secured loan agreements, as well as certain factors: (i) that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and (ii) that management has determined represent operating risks.
  
  Nixon Facility
  
 The Nixon Facility is comprised of assets owned by LE and LRM. LE owns the land, crude oil distillation unit, certain refined petroleum product storage tanks and related piping, and loading and unloading facilities and utilities. LRM owns the naphtha stabilizer and depropanizer units, as well as certain petroleum product storage tanks and related piping. NPS subleases certain petroleum storage tanks from LE.
  
 In 2015, LE and LRM secured $35.0 million in the aggregate in USDA-guaranteed 19-year financing to expand the Nixon Facility’s petroleum storage tank farm. Increased petroleum storage capacity: (i) assists with de-bottlenecking the facility, (ii) supports increased refinery throughput up to approximately 30,000 bpd, and (iii) provides an opportunity to generate additional tolling and terminaling revenue.
  
 As of the date of this Annual Report, the refinery had approximately 1.1 million bbls of crude oil, condensate, and refined petroleum product storage capacity across 35 tanks. When the expansion project is complete, petroleum storage capacity at the Nixon Facility will exceed 1.2 million bbls, an increase of more than 0.9 million bbls since the project began in 2015. The Nixon Facility’s business assets are pledged as collateral under certain of our long-term debt. See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (11) Long-Term Debt, Net” for additional disclosures related to borrowings for capital spending.
  
  Refinery Operations
  
  Refining Industry Overview
  
 Crude oil refining is the process of separating the hydrocarbons present in crude oil into usable or refined petroleum products such as naphtha, diesel, jet fuel and other products. Crude oil refining is primarily a margin-based business where both crude oil and refined petroleum products are commodities with prices that can fluctuate independently for short periods due to supply, demand, transportation and other factors. To increase profitability, or improve margins, it is important for a crude oil refinery to maximize the yields of higher value petroleum products and to minimize the costs of feedstocks and operating expenses. There are also several operational efficiencies that can be deployed to improve margins. These include selecting the appropriate crude oil or condensate to fulfill anticipated product demand, increasing the amount and value of refined petroleum products processed from the crude oil or condensate, reducing downtime for maintenance, repair and investment, developing valuable by-products or production inputs out of materials that are typically discarded, and adjusting utilization rates.
  
 A refinery's product slate depends on the refinery's configuration and the type of crude oil and/or condensate being refined and can be adjusted based on market demand. Although an increase or decrease in the price for crude oil generally results in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined petroleum products, typically there is a time lag between the comparable increase or decrease in prices for refined petroleum products. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on a refinery’s results of operations depends, in part, on how quickly and how fully refined petroleum products prices adjust to reflect these changes.

 Refinery Process Summary
  
 The Nixon refinery is considered a “topping unit” because it is primarily comprised of a crude oil distillation tower or unit, the first stage of the crude oil refining process. The distillation process (crude distillation tower) separates crude oil and condensate into finished and intermediate petroleum products.
  
 The below diagram represents a high-level overview of the current crude oil and condensate refining process at the Nixon refinery.
  
 
 
 
 
 
  Example represents a simplified plant configuration. The specific configuration will vary based on various market and operational factors.
  
 The Nixon refinery is supported by a tank farm that provides feedstock and surge storage capacity, ensuring smooth, uninterrupted refinery operations. A regional electric cooperative supplies electrical power to the Nixon refinery. Fuel gas that is produced at the Nixon refinery is primarily used as fuel within the refinery. In addition, small amounts of propane are occasionally acquired for use in starting-up the Nixon refinery.
  
  Safety and Reliability
  
 We are committed to safe and efficient operations at the Nixon Facility. Turnarounds are used to repair, restore, refurbish or replace refinery equipment such as vessels, tanks, reactors, piping, rotating equipment, instrumentation, electrical equipment, heat exchangers and fired heaters. Typically, a refinery undergoes a major facility turnaround every three to five years. Since the Nixon refinery is still in the recommissioning phase, turnarounds and unscheduled downtime are needed more frequently for unanticipated maintenance or repairs.

BLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY | FORM 10-K 12/31/18
----------------------------+-------------------

 Crude Oil and Condensate Supply
  
 Operation of the Nixon refinery depends on our ability to purchase adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate, which is primarily dependent on our liquidity and access to capital. We currently have in place a month-to-month evergreen crude supply contract with a major integrated oil and gas company. This supplier currently provides us with adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate on favorable terms, and we expect the supplier to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Our ability to purchase adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate could be adversely affected if the Settlement Agreement is terminated and GEL seeks to confirm and enforce the Final Arbitration Award, as well as other factors, including as net losses, working capital deficits, and financial covenant defaults in secured loan agreements.
  
 Management believes that it is taking the appropriate steps to improve our operations and financial stability. If our business strategy is unsuccessful, it could affect our ability to acquire adequate supplies of crude oil and condensate under the existing contract or otherwise. Further, because our existing crude supply contract is a month-to-month arrangement, there can be no assurance that crude oil and condensate supplies will continue to be available under this contract in the future.
  
  Products and Markets
  
  Products. The Nixon refinery’s product slate can be moderately adjusted based on market demand. We currently produce a single finished product – jet fuel. We produce several intermediate products, including naphtha, HOBM, and AGO.
  
  Markets. The Nixon refinery is in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which is represented by the Energy Information Administration as Petroleum Administration for Defense District 3 (“PADD 3”).  Our products are primarily sold in the U.S. within PADD 3. However, with the opening of the Mexican refined products market to private companies, we occasionally sell refined products to customers that export to Mexico. LEH, which is HUBZone certified, purchases our jet fuel and resells the jet fuel to a government agency. Our intermediate products are primarily sold in nearby markets to wholesalers and refiners as a feedstock for further blending and processing. (See “Part I, Item 1. Business – Structure and Management” and “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (9) Related-Party Transactions, Note (11) Long-Term Debt, Net, and Note (19) Commitments and Contingencies – Financing Agreements” for additional disclosures related to LEH.)
  
  Customers. Customers for our refined petroleum products include distributors, wholesalers and refineries primarily in the lower portion of the Texas Triangle (the Houston - San Antonio - Dallas/Fort Worth area). We have bulk term contracts, including month-to-month, six months, and up to one-year terms, in place with most of our customers. Certain of our contracts require our customers to prepay and us to sell fixed quantities and/or minimum quantities of finished and intermediate petroleum products. Many of these arrangements are subject to periodic renegotiation, which could result in higher or lower relative prices for our refined petroleum products. See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (15) Concentration of Risk” of this Annual Report for disclosures related to significant customers.
  
  Competition. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and are engaged on a national or international basis in many segments of the petroleum products business, including exploration and production, refining, transportation and marketing. These competitors may have greater flexibility in responding to or absorbing market changes occurring in one or more of these business segments. We compete primarily based on cost. Due to the low complexity of our simple “topping unit” refinery, we can be relatively nimble in adjusting our refined petroleum products slate because of changing commodity prices, market demand, and refinery operating costs.
  
  Tolling and Terminaling Operations
  
  Operations Overview
  
  We conduct tolling and terminaling operations at the Nixon Facility. The Nixon Facility has a tank farm providing approximately 1.1 million bbls of petroleum storage tank capacity, 0.7 million bbls of which is used for tolling and terminaling storage. Shipments are received and redelivered from within the Nixon Facility via pipeline or from third parties via truck.

----------------------------+-------------------

 Products and Customers
  
  The Nixon Facility’s petroleum storage tanks and infrastructure are primarily suited for crude oil and condensate and refined petroleum products, such as naphtha, jet fuel, diesel and fuel oil. Storage customers are typically refiners primarily in the lower portion of the Texas Triangle (the Houston - San Antonio - Dallas/Fort Worth area). Contract terms range from month-to-month to three years.
 Acquisition, Disposition and Restructuring Activities
  
 We regularly engage in discussions with third parties regarding the possible purchase of assets and operations that are strategic and complementary to our existing operations. However, we do not anticipate any material acquisition activity in the foreseeable future.
 Insurance and Risk Management
  
 Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in crude oil and condensate refining operations, as well as in the transportation and storage of crude oil and condensate and finished and intermediate petroleum products. We have property damage and business interruption coverage at the Nixon Facility. Business interruption coverage is for 24 months from the date of the loss, subject to a deductible with a 45-day waiting period. Our property damage insurance has deductibles ranging from $5,000 to $500,000. In addition, we have a full suite of insurance policies covering workers’ compensation, general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, environmental liability, and other business risks. These are supported by safety and other risk management programs. See also, “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business” in this Annual Report.
 Governmental Regulation
  
 Our operations are subject to extensive and complex federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety statutes, regulations, and ordinances. These laws govern, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum, solid wastes, hazardous wastes, and hazardous substances; the emission and discharge of materials into or through the environment; waste management; characteristics and composition of diesel and other fuels; the monitoring, reporting and control of greenhouse gas emissions; the financial assurance necessary to satisfy decommissioning obligations; and the management of pipeline safety. These laws impose costly obligations on our operations, including requiring the acquisition of permits and authorizations to conduct regulated activities, restricting the way regulated activities are conducted, limiting the quantities and types of materials that may be released into the environment, and requiring the monitoring of releases of materials into the environment.
  
 Failure to comply with environmental, health or safety laws and our existing permits or other authorizations issued under such laws could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions, injunctive relief compelling the installation of additional controls, a revocation of administering our permits, and/or the shutdown of our facilities.
  
 We cannot predict the extent to which additional environmental, health, and safety laws will be enacted in the future, or how existing or future laws will be interpreted with respect to our operations. Many environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent. The cost of compliance with and governmental enforcement of environmental, health, and safety laws may increase in the future. We may be required to make significant capital expenditures or incur increased operating costs to achieve or sustain compliance with applicable environmental, health, and safety laws. This Governmental Regulation section should be read in conjunction with “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report, which discusses our expectations regarding future events based on currently available information.

----------------------------+-------------------

 Air Emissions
  
  Toxic Air Pollutants. The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) regulates air pollutants from stationary and mobile sources. Among other things, the law authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to protect public health and public welfare and to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants. The CAA, as well as corresponding state laws and regulations regarding emissions of pollutants into the air, affect our crude oil and condensate processing operations and impact certain emissions sources located offshore. Under the CAA, facilities that emit volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) or nitrogen oxides face increasingly stringent regulations.
  
 Petroleum refineries are subject to the EPA’s National Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. These standards require petroleum refineries to meet emission standards reflecting the application of the maximum achievable control technology. The affected sources at petroleum refineries are defined to include all process vents, storage vessels, marine tank vessel loading operations, gasoline rack operations, equipment leaks, and wastewater treatment systems located at the refinery. To meet emission standards, we are required to obtain permits, as well as test, monitor, report, and implement control requirements.
  
 Under the EPA’s Mobile Source Air Toxics regulations most refineries producing transportation fuels for highway use in the United States are required to produce at or below 15 ppm sulfur for “on-road” and “off-road” diesel and 30 ppm sulfur for gasoline. The EPA’s Tier 3 Standards similarly reduced motor vehicle emission requirements. The Nixon refinery does not produce gasoline, and the facility ceased production of nonroad, locomotive, and marine, a transportation-related diesel fuel product in 2014 – when the new regulations took effect.  Since 2014, the Nixon refinery has produced HOBM, a non-transportation lubricant blend product.  “Topping units,” like the Nixon refinery, typically lack a desulfurization process unit to lower sulfur content levels within the range required by the EPA’s sulfur control standards, and integration of such a desulfurization unit generally requires additional permitting and significant capital upgrades. We can produce and sell diesel with sulfur content levels above the EPA’s sulfur control standards: (i) in the U.S. as a feedstock to other refineries and blenders and (ii) to other countries as a finished petroleum product.
  
  Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Emission of Greenhouse Gases (“GHGs”) is regulated by the EPA under the CAA. By allowing the regulation of GHGs under the CAA, the EPA’s findings also indirectly impacted many other carbon-intensive industries, which would potentially become subject to federal New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permitting requirements under the CAA (the “CAA Permitting Requirements”). Although we are not currently subject to reporting requirements under GHGs-related regulations, the future adoption of any regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from the Nixon refinery could require us to incur significant costs and expenses or changes in operations, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.
  
  Renewable Fuels
  
 Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA issued Renewable Fuels Standards (“RFS”) that require the blending of biofuels into transportation fuel. Since the compliance mechanism for RFS - Renewable Identification Numbers – would have created a burden on the Nixon refinery related to its nonroad, locomotive, and marine production through 2014, LE applied for an extension of the temporary exemption afforded small refineries through December 31, 2010 under the CAA Section 211(o)(9)(B). The EPA granted the Nixon refinery a small refinery exemption from RFS requirements for 2013 and 2014. Since 2014, the Nixon refinery has solely produced HOBM, a non-transportation lubricant blend product that does not fall under RFS.
 Hazardous Substances and Wastes
  
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) imposes strict, joint and several liability on a broad group of potentially responsible parties for response actions necessary to address a release of hazardous substances into the environment. The law authorizes two kinds of response actions: (i) short-term removals, where actions may be taken to address releases or threatened releases requiring prompt response, and (ii) long-term remedial response actions, that permanently and significantly reduce the dangers associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances that are serious, but not immediately life threatening. As of the filing of this Annual Report, neither we nor any of our predecessors have been designated as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or a similar state statute.
  
 
   
12


  
BLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY | FORM 10-K 12/31/18
----------------------------+-------------------


 
 
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state and local laws impose requirements related to the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Our refining operations generate petroleum product wastes, solid wastes, and ordinary industrial wastes, such as from paints and solvents, that are regulated under RCRA and state law. Certain other wastes generated by the Nixon refinery are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes but are subject to non-hazardous waste regulations. In the future, these wastes could be designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes and therefore may become subject to more rigorous and costly requirements.
  
 The Nixon refinery has been used for refining activities for many years. Although prior owners and operators may have used operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons and various wastes may have been released on or under the Nixon Facility site. Regulatory audits to date have revealed no hazardous substance and waste issues.
  
  Water Discharges
  
 The Clean Water Act (the “CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and stringent controls on the discharge of pollutants, including oil, into federal and state waters. These laws affect our crude oil and condensate processing operations, our petroleum storage and terminaling operations, and our pipeline, facilities, and exploration and production assets. The CWA prohibits the discharge of pollutants into U.S. waters except as authorized by the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or a state agency with delegated authority. Stormwater at the Nixon Facility is tested and discharged pursuant to applicable stormwater permits. Process wastewater from the Nixon refinery is tested and discharged to a nearby municipal treatment facility pursuant to applicable process wastewater permits. Wastewater from our offshore facilities, including our oil and natural gas pipelines and anchor platform, is tested and discharged pursuant to applicable produced water permits.
 Spill Prevention and Control
  
 Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure requirements mandate the use of structures, such as berms and other secondary containment, to prevent hydrocarbons or other pollutants from reaching a jurisdictional body of water in the event of a spill or leak. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA or analogous state laws and regulations. The EPA regulates inland oil spills. See “Offshore Safety and Environmental Oversight” within this governmental regulation section for information on oil spills that occur in coastal waters.
 Offshore Safety and Environmental Oversight
  
 In addition to the CAA, our pipeline, exploration and production assets are also subject to the requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (the “OCSLA”). The OCSLA is administered by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue. BSEE has partnered with the U.S. Coast Guard for oil spill response.
  
  Spill Liability. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), imposes duties and liabilities on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters or adjoining shorelines. With limited exceptions, responsible parties are liable for all removal costs and damages arising from oil spills. Damages may include: injury or economic losses resulting from destruction of real or personal property, damages or loss of use of natural resources used for subsistence, lost tax revenue, royalties, rents, or net profit shares suffered by federal, state, or local governments due to injury to real or personal property, lost profits or impaired earning power because of injury to real or personal property or natural resources, and the net costs of providing increased or additional public services during or after removal activities.
  
 BOEM increased the offshore limit of liability for damages under the OPA from $133.7 million to $137.7 million, plus all clean-up costs, to reflect the increase in the Consumer Price Index since 2013. The onshore facilities limit of liability for damages under the OPA is $633.9 million. A party cannot take advantage of the liability limits if the spill is caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from a violation of federal safety, construction or operating regulations. If a party fails to report a spill or cooperate in the clean-up, liability limits do not apply. The OPA requires responsible parties to provide proof of financial responsibility for potential spills. The amount required for certain types of offshore

 facilities located seaward of the seaward boundary of a state, including properties used for oil transportation, is $35.0 million. BDPL maintains the statutory $35.0 million coverage.
  
 
  Spill Response. Pursuant to the OPA, the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, more commonly called the National Contingency Plan, provides a blueprint for responding to both oil spills and hazardous substance releases. The National Contingency Plan requires, among other things, that responsible parties have an oil spill response plan in place. We have an oil spill response plan in place.
  
  Idle Iron. BSEE requires operators to decommission wells and platforms that have not been used in the past five (5) years for exploration and development operations or as infrastructure to support such operations.
  
 BDPL’s Blue Dolphin Pipeline has been inactive since September 2012. Due to the length of inactivity, BSEE required BDPL to: (i) flush and fill the Blue Dolphin Pipeline, (ii) abandon-in-place a portion of the Blue Dolphin Pipeline’s 20” segment and certain smaller diameter connecting lateral lines that reside offshore in federal waters and (iii) remove from federal waters the GA-288C anchor platform. In April 2016, BDPL submitted decommissioning permit applications to BSEE for three (3) pipeline segments – Segments #13101, #9428, and #15635 – and the GA-288C anchor platform. In June 2016, BDPL also submitted a decommissioning permit application to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for abandonment of Segment #9428. The permit applications were granted by BSEE at varying dates between August 2016 and April 2017. Work must typically be completed within 120 days from the date of permit approval. Abandonment timing primarily depends on resource availability and weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. Management anticipates performing abandonment work during 2019. Weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico during the winter months is typically not conducive to abandonment operations. As of the date of this Annual Report, decommissioning work has not yet been completed.
  
 In a letter dated December 19, 2018, BSEE issued to BDPL an Incident of Noncompliance (“INC”) for its failure to flush and fill Segment #13101 pursuant to the pipeline decommissioning approval letter issued in March 2017. BSEE asserts that the INC authorizes BSEE to impose financial penalties on BDPL if it does not comply with the INC within ten (10) days. As of the date of this Annual Report, flushing of the pipeline segment has not yet commenced.
  
 BDPL has advised BOEM that flushing and abandonment work has not yet been completed. There can be no assurance that BSEE will not impose penalties under the INC. As a result, we are unable to predict BOEM’s response or the ultimate impact, if any, on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, we have not recorded a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, BDPL maintained $2.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in asset retirement obligations related to abandonment of these assets. If BDPL is assessed significant penalties under the INC, we will experience a significant and material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition.
  
  Decommissioning Requirements. To cover the various obligations of lessees and rights-of-way holders operating in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, BOEM evaluates an operator’s financial ability to carry out present and future obligations to determine whether the operator must provide additional security beyond the minimum bonding requirements. Such obligations include the cost of plugging and abandoning wells and decommissioning and removing platforms and pipelines at the end of production or service activities. Once plugging and abandonment work has been completed, the collateral backing the financial assurance is released by BOEM.
  
 In a letter dated March 30, 2018, BOEM ordered BDPL to provide additional supplemental bonds or acceptable financial assurance of approximately $4.8 million (the “Separate Orders”) within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt of the letter. The Separate Orders relate to five (5) existing pipeline rights-of-way. BOEM issued an INC for each Separate Order dated June 8, 2018 and received by BDPL on June 11, 2018. BOEM asserts that the INCs authorize BOEM to impose financial penalties on BDPL if it does not comply with the Separate Orders within twenty (20) days. BOEM asserts that potential penalties accrue for each day BDPL failed to comply after June 28, 2018.  BDPL appealed the INCs on August 8, 2018. The Interior Board of Land Appeals (the “IBLA”) has granted four extension requests that extend BDPL’s deadline for filing a Statement of Reasons with the IBLA until April 22, 2019. BDPL’s pending appeal of the INCs does not relieve BDPL of its obligations to provide additional financial assurance in accordance with the Separate Orders, or of BOEM’s authority to impose financial penalties.

 BDPL has initiated settlement discussions with BOEM to resolve the Separate Orders and the INCs. There can be no assurance that BOEM will: (i) accept a proposal for a reduced amount of supplemental financial assurance, (ii) not require additional supplemental pipeline bonds related to BDPL’s existing pipeline rights-of-way, and/or (iii) not impose penalties under the INCs. As a result, we are unable to predict the outcome of the Separate Orders, the settlement discussions with BOEM or their ultimate impact, if any, on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, we have not recorded a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, BDPL maintained approximately $0.9 million in credit and cash-backed pipeline rights-of-way bonds issued to the BOEM. If BDPL is required by BOEM to provide significant additional supplemental bonds or acceptable financial assurance or is assessed significant penalties under the INCs, we will experience a significant and material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition.
  
  Offshore Safety. Under the Workplace Safety Rule, BSEE requires operators to employ a comprehensive safety and environmental management system (“SEMS”).  SEMS are designed to reduce human and organizational errors as root causes of work-related accidents and offshore spills, develop protocols as to who at the facility has the ultimate operational safety and decision-making authority, and establish procedures to provide all personnel with “stop work” authority. BSEE regulations require that an operator’s SEMS program must be periodically audited by an independent third-party auditor. BDPL has a SEMS program in place.
  
  Health, Safety and Maintenance
  
 We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations related to the health and safety of workers pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. These laws and regulations are administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (the “OSHA”) and by states that have established an OSHA-approved state safety plan.
  
 Our refinery operations are also subject to OSHA process safety management regulations and the National Emphasis Program for Petroleum Refineries (the “RNEP”). RNEP requires refineries to be inspected for compliance with process safety management regulations. Inspections may last from two to six months, including one to three months on site. Inspectors primarily focus on process safety management implementation and recordkeeping. The Nixon Facility was inspected by OSHA in 2013 and again in 2016. Following each inspection, LE was assessed a nominal civil penalty related to failure to comply with documentation and notice posting requirements.
  
 We operate a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by personnel at all levels of the organization. Despite our efforts to achieve excellence in our safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. We routinely monitor our programs and consider improvements in our management systems.
