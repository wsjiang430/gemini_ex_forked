Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage company dedicated to developing transformational treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, a disease without any approved therapies. NASH is a severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the liver that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, cancer and death. Our lead product candidate, efruxifermin, or EFX, is an analog of fibroblast growth factor 21, or FGF21, which is an endogenously expressed hormone that protects against cellular stress and regulates metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins throughout the body. Based on statistically significant fibrosis regression and NASH resolution among patients with biopsy-confirmed pre-cirrhotic NASH, as well as consistent results across multiple clinical trials, we believe EFX has the potential, if approved, to be a best-in-class medicine for treating NASH.
 EFX has been evaluated in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials for which results have been reported. In these clinical trials, a total of 244 adult patients with either NASH (N=161) or T2D (N=83) were treated with EFX and evaluated for up to 24 weeks. We reported Week 24 results of the Phase 2b HARMONY study in patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH (F2-F3) fibrosis in September 2022. Both the 50mg and 28mg EFX dose groups achieved statistical significance on primary and secondary histology endpoints after 24 weeks. On the primary endpoint of at least a one-stage improvement of fibrosis without worsening of NASH, the 50mg group (41%) and 28mg group (39%) had a response rate approximately double that of placebo (20%). In addition, 76% of patients treated with 50mg EFX and 47% of those treated with 28mg achieved NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis, which represented response rates approximately three to five times the placebo rate of 15%. We also observed 41% and 29% response rates for the 50mg and 28mg dose groups, respectively, on a combined endpoint of at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis and NASH resolution, which were approximately six to eight times the 5% placebo rate. Significant improvements in non-invasive fibrosis markers, liver fat, liver enzymes, lipoproteins, and glycemic control were also observed for both EFX dose groups, with an additional significant reduction in body weight observed for the 50mg dose group. Across EFX groups, the most frequent adverse events were mild gastrointestinal events. We believe these results favorably differentiate EFX within the NASH landscape.
 EFX is currently being evaluated in two Phase 2b clinical trials in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH: a long-term follow-up period for the HARMONY study in patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH (F2-F3 fibrosis), for which we reported results after 24 weeks of treatment, and the SYMMETRY study in patients with cirrhotic NASH (F4 fibrosis, compensated). The SYMMETRY study includes an expansion cohort, known as Cohort D, evaluating the safety and tolerability of EFX compared to placebo when added to an existing GLP-1 receptor agonist in patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH (F1-F3 fibrosis) and Type 2 diabetes. We expect to report the results of Cohort D in the second quarter of 2023 and the results of the SYMMETRY study in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Results from the 16-week Phase 2a BALANCED study, which included an expansion cohort of patients who had cirrhosis due to NASH known as Cohort C, as well as the recent results from the 24-week HARMONY study, support our confidence that we will observe statistically significant histological improvements in the SYMMETRY main study evaluating EFX for the treatment of patients with NASH due to cirrhosis. For example, in Cohort C we observed either a one-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH or NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis in 58 percent of EFX-treated patients, compared with 0% for the placebo group, after only 16 weeks of treatment. Response rates for non-invasive markers of fibrosis in Cohort C, which were comparable to the results observed for the BALANCED and HARMONY studies in patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH, are consistent with these initial histology results.
 The FDA has granted both a Fast Track designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation for EFX for the treatment of NASH. In addition, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has granted a Priority Medicines, or PRIME, designation for EFX for the treatment of NASH. The Fast Track and PRIME programs are designed to enhance regulatory support for the development of promising investigational medicines where early clinical data suggest the potential to meet a high unmet medical need. The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy Designation is meant to expedite development and review of a therapy for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical

evidence indicates the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapies. Benefits of these programs may include more frequent regulatory interactions, enhanced guidance on the overall development plan and regulatory strategy, and accelerated assessment of marketing authorization, or MA, applications.
 As demonstrated across four separate clinical trials in patients with NASH and/or T2D for which results have been reported, EFX has a unique ability to reproduce the actions of native FGF21. Consequently, we believe EFX holds the potential to be a highly differentiated, best-in-class FGF21 analog and promising monotherapy for the treatment of NASH, if approved. NASH is a complex disease, and its ideal treatment would include intervening at each stage of its pathogenesis. We believe EFX could potentially address all stages of NASH pathogenesis in a single treatment: reversing fibrosis, resolving steatohepatitis, and helping to restore healthy metabolism to the whole body. We also believe EFX may be able to be used in combination with other therapies for potentially greater effect in certain subpopulations, particularly among the substantial proportion of patients with both NASH and T2D who are expected to be treated with GLP-1 therapeutics to manage their T2D.
 In June 2018, we acquired exclusive global development and commercialization rights to EFX from Amgen Inc., or Amgen, which leveraged its deep protein engineering expertise to design and develop EFX. As of March 6, 2023, our patent portfolio relating to EFX and other peptides included 169 issued patents and 15 pending patents worldwide, with expected patent exclusivity up to 2034 in the United States, including potential patent term extension. Since EFX is a biologic, marketing approval would also provide twelve years of market exclusivity from the approval date of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, in the United States.
 Our management team has extensive experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization, and has been involved in the approvals of more than 20 medicines. Our Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD, was formerly Chief Medical Officer at Gilead, and responsible for clinical development for Gilead's HIV program. Our Chief Development Officer, Kitty Yale, led global clinical operations and management of Gilead’s oncology, HIV, inflammation and liver disease trials. Our Chief Scientific Officer, Tim Rolph, DPhil, was formerly Chief Scientific Officer of Pfizer's Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease Research Unit, and oversaw Pfizer's FGF21 program. We believe that our team is well positioned to leverage its collective experience in drug development and in-depth knowledge of FGF21 biology and metabolic diseases to develop and commercialize products that will have significant benefits for patients with NASH and other serious metabolic diseases with high unmet medical need.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing transformative treatments for serious metabolic diseases with high unmet medical need, with an initial focus on NASH. The key components of our strategy are to:
 Advance EFX through clinical development in both pre-cirrhotic (F2/F3) and cirrhotic (F4, compensated) NASH. We believe that EFX has the potential to be a best-in-class FGF21 analog, if approved, for the treatment of NASH. Data from our Phase 2a BALANCED and Phase 2b HARMONY studies suggest that EFX has the potential to achieve industry-leading levels of fibrosis improvement as well as resolution of steatohepatitis and improvements in glycemic control and lipoprotein profile. We are committed to accelerating development as much as possible for patients with either pre-cirrhotic or cirrhotic NASH, consistent with guidance from regulatory authorities.
 Scale our capabilities to support development and commercialization of EFX. We are scaling our manufacturing and organizational capabilities to capitalize on our exclusive, global rights to market EFX. We have successfully manufactured drug substance at Boehringer Ingelheim and have successfully scaled up manufacturing of a new drug product-device combination at Vetter Pharma. Drug product-device combination units have been manufactured in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP and released for use in Phase 3 clinical trials. When appropriate, we intend to develop the commercial infrastructure required for bringing EFX to patients with NASH in the United States, if approved. We also plan to evaluate options, including potential strategic collaborations, for delivering EFX, if approved, to patients in other key markets, such as Europe, Japan and China.
 Leverage our knowledge of FGF21 biology to bring EFX to additional patients with metabolic diseases. Numerous publications have shown that increases in endogenous FGF21 expression occur in response to various types

of metabolic and cellular stress arising from obesity, diabetes, mitochondrial diseases and cardiovascular disease, as well as NASH. EFX has been engineered to reproduce the biological activity profile of native FGF21 while also addressing certain therapeutic limitations, such as a short half-life. We are exploring opportunities to develop EFX for additional indications where there is a compelling scientific rationale, strong clinical tractability and significant unmet medical need.
 Enhance our position as a leading metabolic disease company by developing, acquiring or in-licensing additional investigational product candidates. We are continually evaluating opportunities to build a robust pipeline of potential leading treatments for serious metabolic diseases. We may select additional assets for their potential as stand-alone monotherapies or for eventual use in combination with other products.
 Our Pipeline
 Our pipeline is anchored by EFX, a potential best-in-class FGF21 analog for treatment of NASH, if approved. We have one EFX program focused on patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH (F2-F3), which is supported by the HARMONY study, an ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial. We have a second EFX program focused on patients with cirrhotic NASH (F4, compensated), which is supported by the SYMMETRY study, an ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial. These two programs align with FDA guidance published in 2018 and 2019, which recommends different regulatory approval pathways for patients with pre-cirrhotic and cirrhotic NASH.

 NASH Overview
 NASH is a severe form of NAFLD, which is driven by the global obesity epidemic. Patients with NAFLD have an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver resulting from an excess of caloric intake over energy needs. In patients with NASH, excessive liver fat leads to hepatocyte stress, which triggers localized inflammation and can cause extensive scarring, or fibrosis, of the liver, as the liver attempts to repair and replace damaged cells.
 Patients with NASH are at increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality, including liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. As NASH progresses, cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality also increase, with cardiovascular disease being the most frequent cause of death in patients with NASH. The prevalence of patients with advanced fibrosis (F2-F4) in the United States is projected to rise to 14.1 million by 2030, representing a roughly 100% increase from an estimated 6.7 million in 2016.
Diagnosis and disease burden
 NASH is currently diagnosed through liver biopsy and its severity is measured using scoring systems that assess the extent and severity of steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning and fibrosis. Some patients may be diagnosed with NASH after presenting with symptoms such as general fatigue and nondescript abdominal

discomfort. However, NASH diagnosis more commonly follows detection of elevated liver enzymes on routine lab tests or detection of an enlarged steatotic liver by abdominal imaging. Although noninvasive methods, including a combination of imaging, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging Protein Density Fat Fraction, or, MRI-PDFF, and fibroscan, and plasma biomarkers of fibrosis, such as Pro-C3, are being evaluated as potential diagnostic tools, none have yet been validated for use in formal NASH diagnosis.
 Two different scoring systems are most commonly used in the United States to measure the severity of NASH: the NAFLD activity score, or NAS, and fibrosis stage. The NAS, which was developed for, and generally only used in, clinical trials, is a measure of liver histology that grades disease activity in patients with NAFLD and NASH. A patient may receive a composite NAS score of 0-8, which is comprised of three individual scores: (1) steatosis, scored 0-3 according to the percentage of a microscopic field showing steatosis, (2) lobular inflammation, scored 0-3 according to the number of immune cell foci per 20x optical field in a microscope, and (3) hepatocellular ballooning, scored 0-2 according to the number of ballooning cells in a microscopic field. In addition, fibrosis staging is used to classify the extent and severity of fibrosis with a scoring system based on a scale from 0-4, or F0-F4. Early, discrete fibrosis is classified as F1 or F2, whereas bridging fibrosis is classified as F3. As more hepatocytes die and scarring becomes extensive, the liver becomes cirrhotic, which is classified as stage F4.
 Patients with NASH are at increased risk of liver damage and other complications. Fibrosis is generally reversible in its early-to-mid stages. However, late-stage fibrosis can be irreversible in the absence of therapy and prevents the liver from performing its natural functions.
 NASH is commonly associated with metabolic comorbidities, including obesity, T2D, dyslipidemia and hypertension. In addition, the majority of patients with NASH also present with metabolic syndrome. As shown in the figure below, which is based on a pooled meta-analysis of multinational clinical trial data published in Hepatology (2017), liver-related mortality increases with fibrosis stage. As compared to healthy individuals, patients with NASH also experience higher all-cause morbidity and mortality resulting from major adverse cardiovascular events, and non-liver cancers. The most common cause of death in patients with NASH is cardiovascular disease. As with liver-related mortality, all-cause mortality also increases with fibrosis stage. Our focus is on patients with F2-F4 fibrosis, which have the highest liver-related and non-liver-related mortality rates among patients with NASH.
 All-cause NASH mortality
 


Market size and trends
 According to studies published in Hepatology (2018) and F1000Research (2018), more than one billion people worldwide were estimated to have NAFLD in 2016, including an estimated 85 million individuals in the United States. Approximately 10-20% of patients with NAFLD progress to NASH, including an estimated 17.3 million individuals in the United States and 16.4 million aggregate individuals in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Japan in 2016. As the population ages, the prevalence of NASH is projected to increase approximately 50% by 2030 to a total of 27.0 million individuals in the United States and 22.5 million aggregate individuals in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan. However, NASH afflicts all age groups, including teenagers and young adults, for whom the loss of quality-adjusted life years will be substantial unless progression to late-stage diseases can be halted or reversed. According to a study published in Hepatology (2016), in the absence of approved therapies, direct healthcare costs associated with NAFLD and NASH in the United States were estimated to be approximately $100 billion in 2016.
 Growth in prevalence of NASH in the United States is projected to be greatest in patients with stage F2-F4 fibrosis, with more than a doubling across these stages between 2016 and 2030 and higher growth rates with each advancing fibrosis stage. More than 14 million Americans are projected to have NASH with F2, F3 or F4 fibrosis in the United States by 2030, with over ten million aggregate individuals in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Japan. This rapid growth in advanced fibrosis reflects the impact of the late 20th century obesity epidemic, leading patients over time to progress through NAFLD to advanced NASH.
Emerging therapies in development
 There are no therapies currently approved for the treatment of NASH. The current standard of care is diet and exercise. Although diet and exercise are effective for some patients in the treatment of NASH when maintained, adherence to this treatment regimen is generally poor. In addition, according to studies in Gastroenterology (2016) and the New England Journal of Medicine (2021), a substantial portion of patients who achieve significant weight loss do not experience fibrosis regression and, among those who do reverse fibrosis, it typically takes 4-5 years.
 The multistep progression of NASH pathogenesis offers a variety of potential approaches for therapeutic intervention and many of these approaches have been explored with one or more therapeutic candidates. During the last few years, many NASH therapeutic candidates have had discouraging clinical trial results due to unfavorable efficacy and/or safety results; a substantial number of programs have been discontinued. Disappointing clinical results have especially been associated with therapeutic candidates designed to target late-stage disease by mitigating inflammation and reversing fibrosis, which have been labeled as “anti-fibrotic” mechanisms. Available data suggest that focusing only on suppressing inflammation and fibrosis is unlikely to deliver sustained reversal of fibrosis or resolution of NASH because the processes underlying NASH pathogenesis are not being addressed.
 Clinical data has been more promising for “metabolic” therapeutic mechanisms that target earlier-stages of NASH pathogenesis, including excessive liver fat accumulation. Recent data for metabolic therapeutic candidates are consistent with data from anti-viral treatment of hepatitis C and modification of diet and exercise as a treatment for NASH. In each of these two cases, targeting the processes underlying inflammation and fibrosis of the liver can lead to reversal of fibrosis, even without a directly anti-fibrotic intervention. However, some of the encouraging data for metabolic therapeutic mechanisms has been offset by unwanted side effects, which may limit their ability to be used as treatment for patients with NASH. For instance, some NASH candidates have been shown to substantially increase plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C, or triglycerides, each of which is an independent causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Patients with NASH are already at increased risk for cardiovascular events. We therefore believe interventions that could be associated with increased cardiovascular risk may struggle to gain marketing approval from regulatory authorities and, if approved, may not be prescribed widely by treating physicians.
We believe the greatest potential for effective NASH treatment requires addressing both the late-stage fibrosis and the underlying processes of NASH pathogenesis with a favorable cardiovascular profile and without increasing the potential for drug-drug interactions associated with small molecules. Some NASH candidates are being evaluated for use in combination with one or more other investigational or marketed drugs to intervene at different stages of NASH pathogenesis and manage unwanted side effects. However, combining multiple interventions, particularly multiple small molecules, places an additional burden of drug metabolism and clearance upon already stressed hepatocytes.


We believe EFX has unique properties with the potential to address the complex pathogenesis of NASH as a foundational monotherapy: reducing liver fat, restoring metabolic balance, and reversing fibrosis while simultaneously improving independent risks of cardiovascular disease, without worsening any aspect of NASH pathogenesis.
 Harnessing FGF21’s Natural Metabolic and Anti-Fibrotic Effects
 EFX harnesses the natural properties of FGF21 as a potential treatment for NASH. Specifically, EFX has been engineered to overcome the limitations of endogenous FGF21 by extending half-life from less than two hours to 2.5-3.5 days while maintaining FGF21’s natural role in alleviating cellular stress and regulating whole-body metabolism. Consequently, EFX has the potential to address the underlying metabolic disease drivers of NASH while also reversing liver fibrosis. We believe EFX has the potential to be the leading FGF21 analog that most closely mimics the native protein with a long half-life that supports convenient weekly dosing.
Overview of FGF21 biology
 Fibroblast growth factors, or FGFs, are a large family of cell-signaling proteins involved in the regulation of many processes within the body. FGF21 is part of a sub-family of FGFs, known as endocrine FGFs, which are unique among FGFs because they initiate their biological effects by binding tightly to a cell surface receptor known as Beta Klotho, or Klotho. After this initial binding, FGF21 triggers signaling pathways within cells, such as hepatocytes and adipocytes, by binding to a second class of cell-surface receptor, known as the FGF receptors, or FGFRs. FGF21 binds to three specific FGFRs, known as FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c. Once a co-receptor complex has formed with Klotho and one of the FGFRs, a series of intracellular signaling cascades is initiated. These signaling cascades enable FGF21 to exert its biological functions, which include regulation of energy homeostasis, glucose-lipid-protein metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and modulation of pathways that mitigate against intracellular stress. FGF21 cannot signal through cell membranes without both an intact C-terminus and an intact N-terminus to bind, respectively, to Klotho and FGFR. We believe EFX has been engineered to maximize binding at both the C-terminus and N-terminus, which distinguishes EFX from other FGF21 analogs.
 EFX is designed to overcome the limitations of native FGF21 as a therapeutic
EFX has been engineered to overcome the limitations of native FGF21 while retaining balanced agonism across FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c. Specifically, EFX delivers: (1) protection against proteolysis and reduction of renal clearance, (2) an increased half-life from less than two hours to 2.5 to 3.5 days, (3) minimization of the potential for aggregation in solution and (4) improved binding affinity for Klotho. These attributes are accomplished through a combination of three amino acid substitutions in the FGF21 protein sequence and an Fc-fusion protein scaffold similar to the platform used for Enbrel and Trulicity. As illustrated in the figure below, each EFX molecule consists of two Fc-FGF21 molecules linked by two disulfide bridges. The N-terminus of the FGF21 moiety is connected to the Fc portion of EFX through a polyglycine-serine linker. Our patents include claims directed to Fc fusion with a recombinantly modified FGF21 as well as claims directed to an FGF21 polypeptide comprising combinations of point mutations at positions 98, 171 and 180 of mature human FGF21. Pharmacokinetic modeling based on analysis of intact, active EFX in human serum after weekly administration of EFX for 16-24 weeks in the Phase 2a BALANCED and Phase 2b HARMONY studies indicates steady-state exposure is attained between weeks 4 and 8. More than a two-fold increase in exposure to EFX is observed for 50mg relative to 28mg despite a less-than-two-fold increase in dose.


Protein engineering of EFX
 
Based on recent in vitro analysis as well as the robust results of clinical trials evaluating EFX, we believe the bivalent structure of EFX, with two FGF21 monomers covalently linked via the disulfide bridges of the Fc fragment, may confer a longer duration of pharmacological activity relative to analogs of FGF21 based on single chain configurations. The in vitro tests analysis demonstrated that the bivalent configuration was associated with a 100-fold greater affinity of EFX for the signaling receptor complex than corresponding single chain configurations.
 EFX maintains balanced agonism of FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c to mimic native FGF21
 
EFX was designed through an empirical discovery process that incorporated in vitro and in vivo measurements of receptor agonism to assess which of many tested discovery candidates yielded the most attractive drug properties. EFX was selected for clinical evaluation over other discovery candidates, which included a proprietary PEGylated FGF21 analog and two versions of a two-point mutation Fc-fusion protein known as RG (with mutations at positions 98 and 171, but not 180), one of which had the Fc fused to the C-terminus while the other had it fused to the N-terminus of the modified FGF21. In comparative in vitro receptor agonism assays, EFX exhibited the greatest potency for each of FGFR1c, FGFR2c, and FGFR3c among the candidates tested. Furthermore, the potency of EFX for FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c was comparable to that of recombinantly-expressed human FGF21.
In vitro receptor agonism assays do not necessarily predict receptor binding when administered in humans. We therefore believe human clinical data is necessary to confirm whether balanced agonism of the FGF receptors is truly achieved. Because certain FGF receptors are expressed predominantly in liver tissue while others are expressed predominantly in peripheral tissue, the extent of binding to different receptors can be assessed from the pharmacodynamic effects in human clinical trials. Increases in adiponectin, for example, depend on activation of FGFR1c in adipose tissue. We believe EFX’s balanced effects when administered in human clinical trials confirm that EFX’s unique engineering results in balanced agonism in vivo as well as in vitro.
The effects observed in clinical trials with EFX contrast with observations from clinical trials evaluating certain pegylated or glycopegylated FGF21 analogs, which we believe may be attributed to the potential for pegylated moieties to accumulate in the liver. For example, each of two FGF21 analogs for which histology results have been reported publicly, one of which is pegylated and one of which is glycopegylated, were observed to have substantially lower rates of fibrosis improvement than observed with EFX. We also observed more substantial reductions in triglycerides and increases in adiponectin than was reported for these two FGF21 analogs, among other measures. We believe the unique and proprietary engineering of EFX, including its targeted amino acid substitutions and Fc fusion scaffold, as described

above, may be responsible for the differentiated clinical effects observed after treatment with EFX compared with other pegylated FGF21 analogs.
EFX exerts both metabolic and anti-fibrotic effects with a favorable cardiovascular profile
 We believe intervening across the core processes underlying NASH pathogenesis is the most effective way to restore health to the liver of patients with NASH and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading contributor to mortality and morbidity among these patients. By mimicking FGF21, EFX has the potential to intervene in each of the core processes underlying NASH pathogenesis acting as both a metabolic and anti-fibrotic therapeutic agent. EFX acts to leverage whole-body metabolism to redirect calories away from the liver to peripheral tissues, including adipose tissue, thereby reducing fat deposited in the liver and decreasing the rate of fat oxidation by the liver. Through this activity, EFX reduces fibrosis both indirectly, as a result of alleviating hepatocyte stress, and directly, by suppressing local inflammation and activation of collagen secreting myofibroblasts that lay down fibrotic tissue.
 Overview of EFX Clinical Development
 We have two active EFX programs supported by two ongoing, parallel Phase 2b clinical trials: the HARMONY study in pre-cirrhotic patients with F2-F3 fibrosis and the SYMMETRY study in patients with cirrhosis due to NASH (F4, compensated). Each of our two Phase 2b clinical trials is precedented by Phase 2a data in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH. We believe that the longer study durations of 24 and 36 weeks in our Phase 2b trials, compared with 16 weeks for the BALANCED study, are likely to show a further improvement in resolution of fibrosis and NASH.
Summary of Completed and Ongoing EFX Clinical Trials in Patients with NASH
 EFX has been administered to a total of 244 adult patients with either NASH or T2D for up to 96 weeks in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials for which results have been reported. In addition, approximately 120 NASH patients are estimated to be treated with EFX in a fifth study that is currently blinded and remains ongoing. Three of these clinical trials have been completed: (a) a single-ascending dose study in patients with T2D, (b) a four-week, multiple-ascending dose study in patients with T2D, and (c) the Phase 2a BALANCED study in patients with NASH, which consisted of a main study in patients with pre-cirrhotic (F1-F3) NASH and an expansion cohort in patients with cirrhosis (F4, compensated). Two clinical trials are ongoing: (d) the Phase 2b HARMONY study in patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH (F2-F3), in which the primary efficacy endpoint was measured at week 24 and patients continue treatment with EFX or placebo for up to 96 weeks and (e) the Phase 2b SYMMETRY study in patients with cirrhosis due to NASH (F4, compensated), for which the primary endpoint will be measured at week 36 and patients will continue treatment with EFX or placebo for up to 96 weeks. We believe the combined results reported to date from these trials provide compelling evidence for EFX’s potential to address all core aspects of NASH pathogenesis. If approved, we believe these attributes of EFX may allow it to emerge as a foundational NASH monotherapy.
 EFX for Treatment of Pre-Cirrhotic NASH (F2-F3)
 
Our lead program focuses on development of EFX for treatment of pre-cirrhotic NASH (F2-F3 fibrosis). The ongoing Phase 2b HARMONY study in patients with F2-F3 fibrosis is precedented by data from the previously completed Phase 2a BALANCED study in patients with F1-F3 fibrosis.
Phase 2b clinical trial of EFX in patients with biopsy-confirmed F2-F3 NASH
 The Phase 2b HARMONY study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial in biopsy-confirmed adult NASH patients with fibrosis stage 2 or 3. The study enrolled a total of 128 patients, randomized to receive once-weekly subcutaneous dosing of 28mg or 50mg EFX, or placebo for 24-weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was the proportion of subjects who achieve at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH at week 24. Key secondary histology endpoints consisted of NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis and a composite endpoint of both NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement at week 24. Additional secondary measures included change from baseline in liver fat, markers of livery injury, noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis, glycemic control, lipoproteins, and body weight at 24 weeks as well as safety and tolerability measures.

HARMONY biopsy analysis and definition of histology endpoints

Consistent with FDA recommendations, the HARMONY study evaluated all biopsies using consensus readers. Two independent and cross-trained pathologists scored each biopsy for NAS score and fibrosis stage. If there were any differences on any component of pathology scoring, the two pathologists met to determine if consensus could be reached. In the absence of consensus, a third pathologist would adjudicate between the first two pathologists’ scores. Adjudication by a third pathologist was not required because the two principal pathologists achieved consensus on interpretation of all HARMONY biopsy samples.
 Per applicable FDA guidance regarding endpoints recommended for use in Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating pre-cirrhotic NASH, the HARMONY study’s primary and key secondary histology endpoints were defined as:
 •Proportion of subjects who achieve improvement in liver fibrosis greater than or equal to one stage (NASH CRN fibrosis score) and no worsening of steatohepatitis (defined as no increase in NAS for ballooning, inflammation, or steatosis)
 •Proportion of subjects who achieve resolution of steatohepatitis (defined as a NAS score of 0–1 for inflammation, 0 for ballooning, and any value for steatosis) and no worsening of liver fibrosis on NASH CRN fibrosis score. 
 •Proportion of subjects who achieve improvement in liver fibrosis greater than or equal to one stage and no worsening of steatohepatitis (as defined above).
 
Both the 50mg and 28mg EFX doses achieved statistical significance on primary and secondary histology endpoints
The HARMONY study met its primary endpoint for both the 50mg and 28mg EFX dose groups, with 41% and 39% of EFX-treated patients, respectively, experiencing at least a one-stage improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of NASH by week 24, compared with 20% for the placebo arm.
   The study also met a key secondary endpoint with 76% and 47% of patients treated with 50mg and 28mg, respectively, achieving NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis, compared with 15% for placebo.


In addition, 41% and 29% of patients treated with 50mg and 28mg, respectively, achieved both endpoints (NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement ≥1 stage), compared with 5% for placebo.

EFX reduced liver fat
 As summarized in the table below, highly statistically significant relative reductions of 52 to 64 percent of liver fat were observed for the 28 and 50mg dose groups, respectively, compared with a 6 percent reduction for placebo.

Roughly two-thirds of EFX patients achieved at least a 50 percent relative reduction in liver fat and one-third to one-half of EFX patients normalized their liver fat levels, which is defined as reaching less than or equal to 5 percent absolute liver fat content at week 24 with a baseline level of greater than 5 percent. Based on the results of additional post-hoc analyses of liver fat reduction, we believe normalization of liver fat, rather than a relative reduction of at least 30 percent liver fat may be a more reliable predictor of histological improvement, particularly NASH resolution.

EFX improved markers of liver injury
The substantial reductions in liver fat among EFX patients correlated with various markers of liver health, including the liver enzyme ALT, as shown in the figure below. The 28 and 50mg EFX groups achieved highly statistically significant ALT reductions by week 8, with reductions of 38 percent and 47 percent, respectively, at week 24, compared with a 4 percent reduction for placebo. Similar dose-related improvements were observed for other liver health markers, including AST, GGT, ALP, and uric acid. We believe the rapid and sustained reductions in ALT are particularly noteworthy as reductions have been positively correlated with histological response.
 
EFX improved noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis
EFX was observed to significantly improve two important noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis. Pro-C3 is a serum biomarker of collagen synthesis and fibrogenesis in the liver. The Enhanced Liver Fibrosis, or ELF, score is a
17


composite biomarker that has strong correlations with fibrosis stage. Reductions in Pro-C3 indicate lower levels of new fibrosis formation while reductions in the ELF score suggest lower overall fibrosis. Pro-C3 and the ELF score are clinically important because they 1) quantitate fibrotic activity throughout the liver rather than in a small biopsy of the liver and 2) are noninvasive and therefore can be measured repeatedly over time, thus overcoming two core limitations of biopsy-based histopathology. As shown in the table below, highly significant absolute reductions in Pro-C3 of about 5 ug/L were observed for both EFX dose groups, compared with a nominal increase for placebo. As shown in the same table below, we also observed highly significant reductions in ELF score of 0.6 to 0.7 were observed for the 28 and 50mg EFX dose groups, respectively, compared with a nominal increase for placebo.

 EFX improved glycemic control, reduced body weight and restored a healthy lipoprotein profile
 As summarized in the following table, treatment with EFX was also associated with significant improvements in multiple metabolic parameters, including markers of glycemic control, body weight, and lipoproteins. This favorable metabolic profile is important because cardiovascular disease remains the greatest mortality risk for patients with NASH. The HARMONY study shows that EFX has the potential to be consistent with the FDA guidance by improving multiple metabolic parameters.

EFX’s potential to improve glycemic control is an important feature of its therapeutic profile because approximately two-thirds of patients with F2-F3 fibrosis have T2D, which is generally poorly controlled. FDA encourages later-stage NASH clinical trials to stratify for T2D status, signifying the importance of assessing the impact of any therapy on patients with both NASH and T2D. EFX treatment resulted in absolute reductions in HbA1c of 0.3% and 0.4% for the 28 and 50mg doses, respectively, compared with no change for placebo. These results exceeded our expectations because EFX was dosed on top of antidiabetic medications for the approximately two-thirds of patients in the study with T2D. EFX’s insulin sensitizing benefits are seen more clearly in the subpopulation of patients with T2D, who had reductions in HbA1c of 0.5 for both EFX dose groups, compared with no change for placebo.


The overall improvement in glycemic control is consistent with observations previously reported by Amgen after treating T2D patients for 4 weeks, as well as observations from our Phase 2a BALANCED study in patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH (F1-F3), underscoring the reproducibility of this effect. Achieving better glycemic control by improving insulin sensitization is highly desirable because it is rectifying a fundamental driver of T2D, which is insulin resistance. This means EFX has the potential to achieve a sustained reduction in HbA1c, in contrast to diabetes therapies that promote insulin secretion whose efficacy tends to wane over time.
The improvement in glycemic control at 50mg was accompanied by a mean reduction in body weight of 2.9kg after 24 weeks, corresponding to 2.6 percent decrease. The trend toward weight loss observed with EFX contrasts with another class of insulin sensitizers, the PPAR gamma agonists. This class includes established antidiabetic drugs like pioglitazone, whose use has declined substantially because of weight gain and edema, and lanifibranor, which has been associated with weight gain of about 2.4-2.7kg and 6 to 8% edema. The weight loss observed with EFX also contrasts with the weight gain observed with another FGF21 analog targeting only the FGFR1c receptor. We believe the potential for weight loss will be attractive to clinicians and NASH patients.
These encouraging metabolic data are best viewed holistically rather than in isolation. The HARMONY study, similar to the BALANCED study, showed that EFX has the potential to rectify each aspect of the metabolic dysfunction associated with NASH: improved glycemic control through enhanced insulin sensitivity, restoration of a healthy lipoprotein profile and reduced body weight. These broadly based improvements increase our confidence that the rapid reduction of steatohepatitis and collagen deposition seen in HARMONY and BALANCED could be sustained over longer treatment periods. The magnitude of metabolic improvements, particularly regarding lipoproteins that are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, also points to the potential of EFX to achieve meaningful reductions in markers of cardiovascular risk.
In summary, while head-to-head preclinical studies and clinical trials have not been conducted, we believe the breadth of desirable clinical effects elicited by EFX sets it apart from other candidates in development for NASH, which frequently trade off efficacy improvements against detrimental effects on lipoproteins, increased body weight, and/or no improvement in glycemic control. With EFX, we see potential to restore a healthy metabolic profile not only to the liver,

but also to the whole body. The results are consistent with our predictions based on FGF21 biology and EFX’s engineering.
EFX was generally well tolerated
 EFX was generally well tolerated in the HARMONY study. There were no deaths in the study, one drug-related Serious Adverse Event, or SAE, and three non-drug-related SAEs. Across EFX groups, the most frequent Adverse Events, or AEs, were grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal events, which were transient in nature. There were two discontinuations due to drug related AEs in each of the 28 and 50 mg EFX groups and no discontinuations due to the most common AE, diarrhea, in the 50mg EFX group. No clinically significant, dose-dependent changes compared to placebo were identified based on laboratory parameters or electrocardiograms. There were no notable or dose-dependent changes in respiratory rate or heart rate. Although transient increases in systolic blood pressure were noted during the study, no dose response was observed, and change from baseline at week 24 was not significantly different compared to baseline or placebo in either dose group.
 As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity following treatment with EFX. The detection of anti-drug antibody, or ADA, formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Our current EFX ADA assay is more than 10 times more sensitive than the minimum FDA requirements. Pre-existing baseline antibodies to EFX were detected in 8.7% of patients. In the evaluable subjects receiving at least 1 dose of EFX, our assay detected the formation of ADAs in roughly 83% of EFX patients, compared with 5% in the placebo group. Importantly, measured antibody titers were largely low or very low, occasionally moderate, and developed slowly. No association was discernable between antibody titer and serum levels of EFX, nor was there a discernable association between tolerability and therapeutic response to EFX.
Phase 2a clinical trial of EFX in patients with biopsy-confirmed F1-F3 NASH
 The main portion of the Phase 2a BALANCED study was a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging clinical trial in adult patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (F1-F3), a NAS score of at least 4, and baseline liver fat of at least 10% on MRI-PDFF screening. Patients were randomized to receive once-weekly subcutaneous doses of either 28, 50 or 70mg of EFX (n=59) or placebo (n=21) for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was absolute reduction in liver fat at week 12 as measured by MRI-PDFF. Additional secondary and exploratory measures included noninvasive measures of liver function, fibrosis biomarkers, insulin sensitivity, lipoproteins and body weight, as well as histological measures based on liver biopsies.
As summarized in the table below, showing placebo-corrected results for the BALANCED and HARMONY studies, the results were largely comparable across the two studies.
 


 EFX was generally well tolerated in the BALANCED study. There were no deaths in the study and two SAEs, one of which occurred prior to dosing and the second of which was related to acute pancreatitis in a patient who was morbidly obese with high insulin resistance at baseline. Across EFX groups, the most frequent AEs were grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal events, which were transient in nature. There were no discontinuations due to treatment-emergent AEs in the 50 mg dose group and none due to the most common AE, diarrhea.
EFX for Treatment of Cirrhosis Due to NASH
 Cirrhosis due to NASH (F4, compensated) presents high unmet medical need, with approximately 50 percent of patients with cirrhosis dying within 5 years absent a liver transplant. This means the risk of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as need for liver transplantation, is substantially higher for cirrhotic patients. The FDA has issued draft guidance specific to the development of investigational therapies for patients with cirrhotic NASH, who are projected to number more than 3.5 million patients in the United States by 2030. According to the FDA, the treatment goal for cirrhotic patients is to halt disease progression, thereby preventing clinical decompensation, reducing the incidence of liver transplantation, and improving survival.
  A recent analysis showed reversal of cirrhosis was associated with an 80% reduction in risk of liver-related clinical events, emphasizing the medical benefit to be gained if a therapy can reverse patients out of cirrhosis. To date, public reports of other investigational NASH drugs in clinical development for treatment of cirrhotic NASH have failed to demonstrate evidence of reversing fibrosis. However, we believe EFX has the potential to be the first therapy approved to treat patients with cirrhosis due to NASH, and to potentially reverse compensated cirrhosis.
  Our belief in EFX’s potential to be an effective treatment for patients with cirrhosis due to NASH is based on the combined results of the BALANCED and HARMONY studies in patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH as well as the results of an expansion cohort of the BALANCED study evaluating patients with cirrhosis due to NASH.
  Phase 2b clinical trial of EFX in patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhotic NASH (F4, compensated) for 36 weeks
 The Phase 2b SYMMETRY main study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in biopsy-confirmed NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4, Child-Pugh class A). One hundred eighty-two patients have been randomized to receive once-weekly subcutaneous dosing of 28 or 50mg EFX, or placebo. The primary endpoint for the trial is fibrosis regression after 36 weeks treatment. Secondary measures include change from baseline in liver enzymes, liver fat, lipoproteins, glycemic control, and body weight at 36 weeks, as well as evaluation of

safety and tolerability. To provide additional safety data from long-term follow up, patients will continue to receive EFX or placebo from 36 to 96 weeks.
Phase 2b SYMMETRY study design
 

Phase 2a expansion cohort of EFX in patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhotic NASH (F4, compensated)
 THE SYMMETRY study builds upon encouraging results from an expansion cohort of the BALANCED study evaluating EFX in patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4, Child-Pugh Class A), which was called Cohort C. Thirty patients were randomized in Cohort C to receive either EFX (n=20) or placebo (n=10) for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was to assess safety and tolerability of EFX in treatment of patients with cirrhotic NASH. Additional noninvasive efficacy measures were included as secondary and exploratory endpoints, including liver enzymes, markers of liver fibrosis, and measures of insulin insensitivity. The Cohort C protocol was amended to include voluntary end-of-treatment liver biopsies to assess whether histological improvements were evident after just 16 weeks of treatment.
EFX improved histology, as measured by fibrosis improvement and NASH resolution
 Results were obtained from a total of 17 of the 30 Cohort C study participants who volunteered for end-of-treatment biopsies, including placebo (n=5) and EFX patients (n=12). The figure below shows the biopsy results for patients who achieved fibrosis improvement without worsening of NASH (33% of EFX patients compared with 0% of placebo patients), and NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis (25% of EFX patients compared with 0% of placebo patients). There was no overlap between responders for each of these two endpoints. Accordingly, a total of 7 of 12 EFX patients, or 58%, showed histological improvements, compared with 0 of 5 placebo patients. We believe these results are encouraging given that they were obtained after only 16 weeks of treatment.

EFX improved noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis
As with the BALANCED main study, EFX was observed to significantly improve three important noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis among patients with cirrhosis due to NASH. These three measures complement the liver biopsy results because they quantitate fibrotic activity across the whole liver and were collected for all patients, not only those who volunteered for end-of-treatment biopsies. The improvements in noninvasive measures of liver fibrosis for all EFX-treated patients, as shown in the table below, appear consistent with the histological improvements observed for the subset of patients who volunteered for end-of-treatment biopsies.

EFX was generally well tolerated
 EFX was generally well tolerated in Cohort C. There were no deaths. One patient in the placebo arm reported an SAE of pulmonary embolism. One placebo patient withdrew consent and one patient in the EFX arm discontinued due to abdominal distension, constipation, diarrhea and pruritus. The most frequently reported study drug-related treatment-emergent AEs were transient mild-to-moderate diarrhea and nausea, which often resolved on study without treatment. All injection site reactions were grade 1.
Evaluation of EFX in combination with GLP-1 therapy in patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH
 The SYMMETRY study includes an expansion cohort, known as Cohort D, evaluating administration of EFX to patients with T2D who are already being treated with GLP-1 therapy. The primary goal of the 12-week Cohort D expansion, in which 32 patients with T2D and F1-F3 liver fibrosis due to NASH have been randomized, is to assess safety and tolerability of EFX compared to placebo when added to an existing GLP-1 receptor agonist.
Future studies will evaluate the potential of EFX to accelerate resolution of NASH and reversal of fibrosis among NASH patients already on GLP-1 therapy, which could help address an urgent medical need to restore a healthy liver.

Exclusive license agreement with Amgen Inc.
 In June 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Amgen Inc., or Amgen, pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by

Amgen, to commercially develop, manufacture, use, distribute and sell therapeutic products, or Products. In particular, we have been granted licenses under patents filed in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions that are owned or controlled by Amgen, including an exclusive license under certain patents claiming polypeptides comprised of an FGF21 portion with certain point mutations, a linker, and an Fc domain. Our exclusively licensed patents include, but are not limited to, the composition of EFX and methods of using the same. In connection with the license, Amgen also licensed and transferred to us certain know-how related to the manufacture of EFX as well as certain quantities of EFX drug substance manufactured to Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, for clinical use, master cell bank, not-for-human use EFX drug product suitable for nonclinical studies and critical reagents.
 Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a Product in each of several major market territories. In addition, Amgen provided us, at its expense, consulting support in connection with the transfer of the licensed materials and the exploitation of the Products. We are also entitled to sublicense the rights granted to us under the license agreement.
 As initial consideration for the license, we paid Amgen an upfront payment of $5.0 million and also issued 2,653,333 shares of our Series A preferred stock to Amgen at the time of the initial closing in June 2018 with a subsequent 3,205,128 shares of our Series A preferred stock issued at the time of the second closing in November 2018, representing 10% of total shares outstanding at such times. In August 2019 we made an additional payment of $2.5 million in connection with dosing the first patient in our Phase 2a clinical trial, which was the first development milestone under the license agreement. As additional consideration for the license, we are required to pay Amgen $7.5 million in connection with dosing the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial, up to $30.0 million in connection with marketing approvals, and aggregate milestone payments of up to $75.0 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones for all products licensed under the Amgen Agreement. No commercial milestones have been achieved to date under the license agreement. We are also required to pay tiered royalties of low to high single-digit percentages on annual net sales of the products covered by the license. The royalty rate with respect to the net sales is subject to customary reductions, including in the event that the exploitation of a Product is not covered by a valid claim with the licensed patent rights. The royalty term will terminate on a country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity in such country, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 The license agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the Products in the territory. Upon expiration of the license agreement, the licenses granted to us shall be considered fully paid-up, irrevocable and non-exclusive. Either we or Amgen may terminate the license agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement or defaults in the performance thereunder and fails to cure that breach within 90 days (or 30 days in the case of failure to make any payment as and when due under the agreement) after written notice is provided or in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up. Amgen shall have the right to terminate the license agreement in full upon written notice to us in the event we, our affiliates or sublicensees, directly challenge the patentability, enforceability or validity of any licensed patents, unless, in the event of a sublicensee challenge, we terminate the sublicense within 60 days’ notice. We shall have the right to terminate the license agreement within 90 days written notice to Amgen if we conclude, due to scientific, technical, regulatory or commercial reasons, that the exploitation of the Products is no longer commercially practicable.
 Intellectual property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements. Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it through a variety of approaches, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, novel biological discoveries, new targets and applications, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, we generally intend to pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of making and methods of use, including combination therapies. As we continue the development of our product candidates, we intend to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through claims covering additional methods of use and biomarkers and complementary diagnostic and/or companion diagnostic related claims. As of March 6, 2023, we have licensed from Amgen Inc. approximately 184 patents and pending patent

applications worldwide, including 169 issued patents and 15 pending patent applications. There are currently no pending U.S. provisional patent applications.
 As of March 6, 2023, our patent portfolio relating to EFX includes twelve issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and issued and pending foreign counterpart patents in Europe, Asia, Canada, Australia, and Mexico. Seven issued U.S. patents include claims directed to the EFX product, the FGF21 polypeptide component of the EFX product, nucleic acids encoding the product and related polypeptides, polypeptide multimers, related compositions, and methods of using EFX to, e.g., treat diabetes, lower blood glucose in patients suffering from a metabolic disorder, improve glucose tolerance, lower body weight, or reduce triglyceride levels in patients. These issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2029. The pending U.S. patent application and related foreign counterparts are directed to a method of treating a patient with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); if issued, the resulting U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2029. We currently anticipate that a composition of matter patent will be eligible for patent term extension to 2034 in the U.S. The portfolio further includes five issued U.S. patents that are directed to related polypeptides and methods of use. An international patent application is pending relating to EFX formulations.
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors, and non-solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties, such agreements will not be breached, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. For more information, see "Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property."
 Manufacturing and supply
 We manage several external commercial manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to develop and manufacture EFX.
 EFX drug substance, or DS, is manufactured by fermentation of a recombinant strain of the bacterium E. coli. Product accumulates as insoluble particles (inclusion bodies) within the cells and is recovered by cell disruption, followed by solubilization of the inclusion bodies, protein refolding and several chromatographic separation steps to yield product with target quality attributes. We have an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, to manufacture DS for clinical development and plan to enter into a future agreement for commercial supply at an appropriate time. Whereas our Phase 2a BALANCED study was supplied by DS acquired by Amgen, our ongoing Phase 2b HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies are being supplied by DS manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. Analysis of the Boehringer Ingelheim GMP DS confirmed it met the same release specification as previously used for Amgen GMP DS and was comparable to Amgen GMP DS across a number of protein characterization studies.
We have an agreement with Vetter Pharma International GmbH, or Vetter, to manufacture EFX drug product, or DP, for clinical development and plan to enter into a future agreement for commercial supply at an appropriate time. The GMP DP being used for our ongoing HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies is similar to that for the BALANCED study, which was stored as a frozen liquid until immediately before administration to trial subjects. Analysis of the Vetter GMP DP confirmed that it met the same release specification as previously used for the DP manufactured from Amgen GMP DS.
 We plan to use a newly developed lyophilized DP formulation for Phase 3 clinical trials and as the initial commercial presentation, if EFX is approved. This drug-device combination product, employing Vetter’s Lyo-Ject 3S dual-chamber syringe, was selected for convenient subcutaneous patient self-administration. Manufacturing of the product-device combination has been scaled up at Vetter and GMP lots have been released for use in Phase 3 clinical trials.


Sales and marketing
 Successful marketing of a new drug for the treatment of NASH will require a targeted commercial infrastructure. We expect to begin making plans for commercialization in parallel with our ongoing HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies. We have also contracted with a third-party manufacturer, Vetter, to support clinical development and the potential commercialization of EFX with commercial-scale manufacturing. We intend to develop the commercial infrastructure required for bringing EFX to patients in the United States, if approved, in parallel with an anticipated Phase 3 clinical trial. We also plan to evaluate options for delivering EFX, if approved, to patients in other key markets, such as Europe, Japan and China, which may include strategic collaborations.
 Competition
 The biotechnology industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions.
We understand that a number of pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca PLC/MedImmune LLC, Boehringer Ingelheim AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Inc., Eisai, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, GSK plc, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Novo Nordisk A/S, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding AG, Sanofi and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, as well as large and small biotechnology companies such as Albireo Pharma, Inc., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Altimmune, Inc., Amgen, Inc., Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Axcella Health, Inc., Boston Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cirius Therapeutics, Inc., CohBar, Inc., CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc., 89bio, D&D Pharmatech, Inc., Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Galectin Therapeutics Inc., Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Hanmi Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd., Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Inventiva Pharma SA, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MediciNova, Inc., North Sea Pharmaceuticals, Poxel SA, Sagimet Biosciences, Inc., Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Viking Therapeutics, Inc. are or may be pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that target NASH. It is also probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of serious metabolic diseases, such as NASH, will increase. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking nonclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for superior products. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels for the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. Smaller and earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
 Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies, then we may not be able to commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market. This would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics, medical devices and combinations of biologics and devices, or combination products, such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors,

will be required to navigate the various nonclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
U.S. biological product development
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulation; 
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 
 •approval of a clinical trial protocol and related documentation by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to FDA's regulations commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use; 
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for MA that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product's identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA in accordance with any applicable expedited programs or designations; 
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies); and 
 •FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 
 
Nonclinical and clinical development
Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP regulations and requirements.
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of the nonclinical tests, including animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within the 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to, among other considerations, unreasonable or significant safety concerns, inability to assess safety concerns, lack of qualified investigators, a misleading or materially incomplete

investigator brochure, study design deficiencies, interference with the conduct or completion of a study designed to be adequate and well-controlled for the same or another investigational drug, insufficient quantities of investigational product, lack of effectiveness, or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing a clinical trial to begin, or that, once begun, issues or circumstances will not arise that delay, suspend or terminate such studies.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor's control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its related documentation before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA may accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the cases of some products for severe of life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in the targeted patient population.
Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning Phase 3 clinical trials.
Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval or licensure and product labeling.
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the

investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualified for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsor's data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA submission and review
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. In both standard and priority reviews, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a "filing" decision. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a proposed product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use, and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product's continued safety, purity and potency. Further, the FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve a product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities

are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs do not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process. To be eligible for Fast Track designation, new biological products must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic may request the FDA to designate the biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of Fast Track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application for a product that has received Fast Track designation on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted.
Under the FDA's breakthrough therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, the FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible.
A product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and has the potential, if approved, to provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an

effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA's goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review.
Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval (also referred to as Subpart E approval). Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, as demonstrated by a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint, may receive accelerated approval. Specifically, this means that they may be approved on the basis of clinical data establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing confirmatory clinical trials to verify the clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (“FDORA”), the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval, and the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA generally requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Pediatric information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 of Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints, and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
Post-Approval requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors, including those supplying products, ingredients, and components of them, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for ongoing compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. For certain commercial prescription biologic products, manufacturers and other parties involved in the supply chain must also meet chain of distribution requirements and build electronic, interoperable systems for product tracking and tracing and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or other products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, regulate manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use of their products.
U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission data of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, including some regulatory exclusivity periods tied to patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a study.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.

Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted a 12 year exclusivity period from the time of first licensure of the product. The FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. "First licensure" typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the "first licensure" of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
 Certain products may be comprised of components, such as drug components, biologic components and device components, that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:
•a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; 
 •two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; 
 •a drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or 
 •any investigational drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect. 
 
Under the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA center for combination products, although it does not

preclude consultations by the lead center with another FDA center. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
A combination product with biologic primary mode of action, such as a biologic dispensed in a pre-filled syringe, generally would be reviewed and licensed pursuant to the biologic licensing processes under the PHS Act. In reviewing the BLA application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the drug or biologics center could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product meets applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance.
Following approval of a combination product, each component of a combination product retains its regulatory status (as a biologic or device, for example) and is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component. Accordingly, under FDA regulations, biologic-device combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both biologics and devices, including the cGMP requirements for biologics and the FDA’s Quality System Regulation applicable to medical devices.
 Other U.S. healthcare and Data Privacy laws and compliance requirements
In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business that may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain MA. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and responsible individuals may be subject to imprisonment.
Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, as well as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek

attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances. For example, in California the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating a broad definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Many of the state laws differ from each other in significant ways and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA and cover personal information other than protected health information that is subject to HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
We may develop products that, once approved, may be administered by a physician. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain products not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B is part of original Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary's health condition. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement for a manufacturer's eligible drugs, the manufacturer is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program.
In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price, or ASP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual

imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private "qui tam" actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors are critical to new product acceptance.
Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor's determination that use of a therapeutic is:
 •a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 •safe, effective and medically necessary; 
 •appropriate for the specific patient; 
 •cost-effective; and 
 •neither experimental nor investigational.
 
We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Private third-party payors tend to follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement limitations to a substantial degree, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, one payor's determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, or EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical

trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the Affordable Care Act provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
 •an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011; 
 •an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP; 
 •a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70%, the current discount owed as of January 1, 2019 pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA) point-of-sale discounts, off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers' outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 
 •extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 
 •expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in 2014 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability; 
 •expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program; 
 •a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 
 •expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance; 
 •a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; 
 •requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals; 


•a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; 
 •establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending; and 
 •a licensure framework for follow on biologic products._
 
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the Fifth Circuit Court and the United States Supreme Court, and the Trump Administration has issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Additionally, Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended. We cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business, especially under the Biden administration.
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the former Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the former administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Further, the former administration also previously released a "Blueprint", or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will challenge, reverse, revoke or otherwise modify these executive and administrative actions after January 20, 2021.
In addition, there have been several changes to the 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that certain drug and biologic manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities. It is unclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products in the future, if any. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, former President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the former administration's proposals. In response, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and would have applied to all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2027. However, in response to a lawsuit filed by several industry groups, on December 28, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining government defendants from implementing the MFN Rule pending completion of notice-and-comment procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act. On January 13, 2021, in a separate lawsuit brought by industry groups in the U.S. District of Maryland, the government defendants entered a joint motion to stay litigation on the condition that the government would not appeal the preliminary injunction granted in the U.S. District

Court for the Northern District of California and that performance for any final regulation stemming from the MFN Interim Final Rule shall not commence earlier than 60 days after publication of that regulation in the Federal Register. Further, authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada and the MFN Model may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Additionally, on December 2, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to an order entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D has been delayed to January 1, 2026. This deadline was delayed to January 1, 2027 by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 further delayed implementation of this rule to January 1, 2032. While a number of these and other proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to request access to certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Government regulations outside the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization and approval of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country's national competent authority, or NCA, and an independent ethics committee, or EC, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Under the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) no 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022, a single application is now made through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS, for clinical trial authorization in up to 30 EU/EEA countries at the same time and with a single set of documentation.


The assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. The new Clinical Trials Regulation also provides for simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Regulation in the European Union
In the EU, medicinal products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and national levels. To obtain regulatory approval of a medicinal product in the EU, we must submit an MA application. The application used to submit the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with certain exceptions. There are two main types of MA in the EU:
 •The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EU, and in the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, including medicines produced by as biotechnological process, products as designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (i.e. gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant an MA, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EU, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States, or CMSs) for their approval. If the CMSs raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the CMSs).


Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain is no longer covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized MAs continues to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January 1, 2021. For a period of three years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new MA in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required. On January 24, 2023, the MHRA announced that a new international recognition framework will be put in place from January 1, 2024, which will have regard to decisions on the approval of MAs made by the European Medicine Agency and certain other regulators when determining an application for a new Great Britain MA. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to MAs approved in EU Member States through decentralized or mutual recognition procedures with a view to more quickly granting an MA in the United Kingdom or Great Britain.
 The EU also provides opportunities for regulatory exclusivity. For example, in the EU, upon receiving an MA, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator's preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MA application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed in the EU until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained an MA based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Pediatric development in the Europe Union
In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the product for which an MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted an MA on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.

PRIME designation
 In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where the MA application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MA application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the EMA’s CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at the EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
 Post-approval controls in the European Union
The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
All new MA applications must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.
All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, or SmPC, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another.
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order, or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States and the Bribery Act of 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.
 Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician's employer, his or her competent professional organization, and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines, or imprisonment.


Regulation of Combination Products
 The EU regulates medical devices and medicinal products separately, through different legislative instruments, and the applicable requirements will vary depending on the type of drug-device combination product. EU guidance has been published to help manufacturers select the right regulatory framework. In the case of drug-delivery products intended to administer a medicinal product where the device and the medicinal product do not form a single integral product, the medicinal product is regulated in accordance with the aforementioned rules while the device part is regulated as a medical device and will have to comply with all the requirements set by Regulation 2017/745, or the Medical Devices Regulation (which became applicable on 26 May 2021 and repealed the EU Council Directive 93/42/EEC, or the Medical Devices Directive). Where the medical device and medicinal product form a single integrated product (e.g. pre-filled inhalers), if the principal intended action is achieved by the medicine, the product is considered a medicinal product that includes a medical device and the entire product is regulated under the EU pharmaceutical legislation. However, the MA application for the product should include a CE certificate for the device in accordance with the Medical Devices Regulation or, if not CE marked but would need to be certified if marketed separately, the applicant must include an opinion from a notified body on conformity of device (except for Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices). This is a requirement under the new Medical Devices Regulation.
The characteristics of non-integral devices used for the administration of medicinal products may impact the quality, safety and efficacy profile of the medicinal products. To the extent that administration devices are co-packaged with the medicinal product or, in exceptional cases, where the use of a specific type of administration device is specifically provided for in the product information of the medicinal product, additional information may need to be provided in the MA application for the medicinal product on the characteristics of the medical device(s) that may impact on the quality, safety and/or efficacy of the medicinal product. The requirements regarding quality aspects for integral drug-device combination products, including devices that are co-packaged with medicinal products, are outlined in an EMA guideline which came into effect on January 1, 2022.
The EU requires that all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I of the Medical Devices Regulation. The most fundamental requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Regulation, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product, and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU countries to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.
As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the general safety and performance requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.


European data collection
The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR imposes more stringent requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the EEA and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules, specifically fines are increased to levels of up to 4% total worldwide annual turnover or up to €20 million (whichever is higher). The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. We are subject to the GDPR if we have a presence or "establishment" in the EEA (e.g. EEA based subsidiary or operations), when conducting clinical trials with EEA based data subjects (whether the trials are conducted directly by us or through a clinical vendor or partner) or offering approved products or services (if relevant) to EEA based data subjects (regardless of whether involving our EEA based subsidiary or operations). The GDPR regulations may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
In addition, further to the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the United Kingdom at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom’s EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the United Kingdom’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EEA’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the European Commission has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EEA to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the United Kingdom to the EEA remain free flowing.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 and the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not provide for wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework continues to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge more significantly in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation.
 Rest of world regulation
For other countries outside the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Middle East, or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, or criminal prosecution.
Additional regulation
In addition to the foregoing, local, state and federal laws regarding such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Human Capital Resources
 We believe the success of our mission largely depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We believe programs that foster company engagement, diversity, equity and inclusion, growth and development while providing competitive compensation and benefits will attract a diverse population of employees who will bring innovative ideas and creative solutions that will enable the achievement of our goals. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
 
As of February 28, 2023, we employed 38 full-time employees, including 25 in research and development and 13 in general and administrative and one part-time employee. Seven of our employees hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective-bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Akero Therapeutics, Inc.
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)
 1. Nature of the business and basis of presentation
Akero Therapeutics, Inc., together with its wholly owned subsidiary Akero Securities Corporation, (“Akero” or the “Company”) is a clinical-stage company dedicated to developing transformational treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, a disease without any approved therapies. NASH is a severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the liver that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, cancer and death. The Company’s lead product candidate is efruxifermin, or EFX, an analog of fibroblast growth factor 21, or FGF21, which is an endogenously expressed hormone that protects against cellular stress and regulates metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins throughout the body. EFX is currently being evaluated in two Phase 2b clinical trials in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH: the HARMONY study in patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH (F2-F3 fibrosis) and the SYMMETRY study in patients with cirrhotic NASH (F4 fibrosis, compensated). The SYMMETRY study includes an expansion cohort, known as Cohort D, evaluating the safety and tolerability of EFX compared to placebo when added to an existing GLP-1 receptor agonist in patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH (F1-F3 fibrosis) and Type 2 diabetes. The Company recently reported Week 24 results from the HARMONY study, which showed statistically significant response rates for both the 50mg and 28mg dose groups on both fibrosis regression and NASH resolution among patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH. Based on these data and data from the BALANCED study, the Company believes EFX has the potential, if approved, to be a best-in-class medicine for treating NASH.
The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, completion and success of clinical testing, development by competitors of new technological innovations, compliance with governmental regulations, dependence on key personnel and protection of proprietary technology and the ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. EFX will require extensive clinical testing prior to regulatory approval and commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel, and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if the Company’s drug development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize significant revenue from product sales.
Basis of presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. All adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the periods presented have been reflected.
Liquidity
In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), the Company has evaluated whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued.
Since its inception, the Company has funded its operations primarily with proceeds from sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock and with proceeds from its initial public offering (“IPO”) in June 2019, a follow-on public offering of its common stock in July 2020 and most recently through a term loan and a registered direct offering in June 2022 and a follow-on public offering in September 2022. The Company has incurred recurring losses since its inception, including net losses of $112,033 and $100,777 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $422,337. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of March 17, 2023, the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements, the Company expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities of $351,449 as of December 31, 2022, will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. The Company expects that it will require additional funding to complete the clinical development of EFX, commercialize EFX, if it receives regulatory approval, and pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)
If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continuing operations, if at all.

 2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Use of estimates
The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the recognition of research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expense, warrant liabilities and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, known trends and other market-specific or other relevant factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates when there are changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts invested in money market accounts.

Short-term marketable securities
The Company invests in short-term marketable securities, primarily money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. treasury securities and corporate debt securities. The Company continually evaluates the credit ratings of its investment portfolio and underlying securities. The Company invests in accordance with its investment policy and invests at the date of purchase in securities with high ratings from top rating agencies. The Company classifies its short-term marketable securities as available-for-sale securities and reports them at fair value in short-term marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets with related unrealized gains and losses included within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. The amortized cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which is included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. When the fair value is below the amortized cost of a marketable security, the Company reviews and determines whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. The credit-related impairment amount is recognized in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, with a corresponding allowance for credit losses account in the consolidated balance sheet. Subsequent improvements in expected credit losses are recognized as a reversal of an amount in the allowance account. If the Company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the allowance for the credit loss is written-off and the excess of the amortized cost basis of the asset over its fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no credit losses recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Restricted cash
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company was required to maintain a separate cash balance of $108 for the benefit of the landlord in connection with the Company’s Gateway office space lease in South San Francisco, California (the “Gateway Lease”), which is classified within other assets (non-current) on the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 12).

(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)
Concentrations of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities. The Company regularly maintains deposits in accredited financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company invests its excess cash primarily in money market funds, U.S. treasury notes, and high quality, marketable debt instruments of corporations in accordance with the Company’s investment policy. The Company’s investment policy defines allowable investments and establishes guidelines relating to credit quality, diversification, and maturities of its investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash equivalents and marketable securities and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks of losses.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company held cash deposits at Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) in excess of government insured limits. On March 10, 2023, SVB was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) was appointed as receiver. No losses were incurred by the Company on deposits that were held at SVB. Management believes that the Company is not currently exposed to significant credit risk as the vast majority of the Company’s deposits were either owned directly by the Company and held in custody at a third-party financial institution or, subsequent to March 10, 2023, have been transferred to a third-party financial institution. As of March 17, 2023, the Company has approximately €12,000 on deposit with SVB, which it expects to transfer to another financial institution in the near term. The Company does not currently have any other significant relationships with SVB.

Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether the Company has the right to control the identified asset. Right-of-use, or ROU, assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets are based on the measurement of the lease liability and are further adjusted by any lease payments made prior to or on lease commencement, lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred, as applicable. The Company has elected to not recognize leases with a lease term of one year or less on its balance sheet. Operating lease costs included in the measurement of the lease are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred as an operating expense.
The Company determines the lease classification and the present value of future lease payments at the time of the lease commencement using an incremental borrowing rate that it estimates based upon the Company’s credit risk and term of the lease. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts has not historically been readily determinable and the Company must therefore use the appropriate incremental borrowing rate to measure its leases. To estimate the incremental borrowing rate, a credit rating applicable to the Company is estimated using a synthetic credit rating analysis since the Company does not currently have a rating agency-based credit rating.
Research and development costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to discover, research and develop drug candidates, including personnel expenses, stock-based compensation expense, third-party license fees and external costs including fees paid to consultants, contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and clinical research organizations, or CROs, in connection with drug product manufacturing, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, and other related clinical trial fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening, laboratory work, clinical trial database management, clinical trial material management and statistical compilation and analysis. Non-refundable prepayments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the purchase of contract manufacturing services are included as a component of research and development expense.
Costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses are charged immediately to research and development expense if the technology licensed has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future uses.

Research contract costs and accruals
The Company has entered into various research and development and other agreements with commercial firms, researchers and others for provisions of goods and services. These agreements are generally cancelable, and the related costs are recorded as research and development expenses as incurred. The Company records accruals for estimated ongoing research and development costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, the Company analyzes progress of the studies or clinical trials, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from the Company's estimates.

Stock-based compensation
The Company makes stock-based awards from its stock compensation plans (see Note 7). The Company measures all stock-based awards granted to employees and nonemployees based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award, on a straight-line basis. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for awards that contain performance-based conditions using the accelerated attribution method when management determines it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation for restricted stock units is measured based on the market closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally four years.
The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and the Company's expected dividend yield. The Company went public in June 2019 and accordingly, lacks sufficient company-specific historical and implied volatility information for its shares traded in the public markets. Therefore, it estimates its expected share price volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded share price. The expected term of the Company's stock options has been determined utilizing the "simplified" method for awards that qualify as "plain-vanilla" options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends on common stock and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The fair value of each common stock award is estimated on the date of grant based on the fair value of the Company's common stock on that same date.
Compensation expense for purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is recognized based on the fair value of the common stock estimated based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of offering, less the purchase discount percentage provided for in the plan.
The Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient's payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient's service payments are classified.

Loan Payable
 
Akero Therapeutics, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)
Loan Payable represents the Loan and Security Agreement (“Loan Agreement”) with Hercules Capital, Inc. (“Hercules”), which the Company has accounted for as a debt financing arrangement. Interest expense is accrued using the effective interest rate method over the estimated period the loan will be repaid. Loan issuance costs have been recorded as a debt discount in the consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized and recorded as interest expense throughout the life of the Loan Agreement using the effective interest rate method. The Company considered whether there were any embedded features in the Loan Agreement that require bifurcation and separate accounting as derivative financial instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.

Warrant Liabilities
The Company accounts for warrants anticipated to be issued in the future under the Loan Agreement as liabilities and measures them at fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each prospective balance sheet date, with any changes in the fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or in the Company's tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

Net loss per share
Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration of common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share, since the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive given the Company’s net loss.
Comprehensive loss
Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders' equity (deficit) that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. The Company’s comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and changes in unrealized gains and losses on its short-term marketable securities.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU 2016-13"), which introduced a new methodology for accounting for credit losses on financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. The Company adopted ASU 2016-03 as of January 1, 2021. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, those losses are recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the underlying security. The adoption of ASU 2016-03 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”, or ASU 2020-06. ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.


 3. Fair value measurements
Certain assets and liabilities of the Company are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:
•Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2—Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices), such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
•Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.

Corporate debt securities were valued by the Company using quoted prices in active markets for similar securities, which represent a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company also held $41,834 in interest-bearing, overnight sweep accounts. This amount approximates its fair value due to the short-term nature of the accounts. The carrying values of the Company’s prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
The Loan Payable is classified as a Level 3 liability. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Loan Payable, approximates its fair value. The Company estimated the fair value of the warrant liabilities using the Black-Scholes model based on key assumption and inputs (see Note 6). The Company utilizes a probability assessment to estimate the likelihood of vesting for the remaining Loan Agreement warrants and allocated the probability of occurrence percentage to the fair values calculated.

6. Loan Payable and Warrant Liability
On June 15, 2022, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (“Loan Agreement”) with Hercules Capital, Inc. (“Hercules”), for an aggregate principal amount of $100,000 (“Term Loan”). Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Term Loan is available to the Company in four tranches, subject to certain terms and conditions.
Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Company received $10,000 upon closing, $15,000 was borrowed on March 10, 2023 and an additional $10,000 is available to the Company at its sole discretion. An additional $20,000

Akero Therapeutics, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)
 will become available to the Company upon the achievement of certain clinical and financial milestones. An additional $45,000 may become available to the Company at Hercules' sole discretion.
The Term Loan will mature on January 1, 2027 (the “Maturity Date”). The Term Loan bears interest at a variable annual rate equal to the greater of (a) 7.65% and (b) the Prime Rate (as reported in the Wall Street Journal) plus 3.65% (the “Interest Rate”). The Company may make payments of interest only through July 1, 2024, which may be extended to July 1, 2025 upon the achievement of certain milestones (the “interest-only period”). After the interest-only period, the principal balance and related interest will be required to be repaid in equal monthly installments and continuing until the Maturity Date.
The Loan Agreement contains customary closing fees, events of default, and representations, warranties and covenants, including a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain a minimum cash balance in relation to the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan. The Loan Agreement provides for a prepayment charge equal to 3% of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan if prepayment is made within the first twelve months after closing, 2% if within the second twelve months after closing and 1% thereafter. In addition, the Loan Agreement provides for an End of Term Charge that will be the greater of 5.85% of the outstanding principal balance or $1,170, which is recognized as a debt discount and is being accreted into the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount using the effective interest rate method over the term of the loan payable.
Upon closing, the Company issued warrants to Hercules to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("common stock"). The number of shares that may be purchased for the Warrants will not exceed 1.5% multiplied by the greater of Tranche I and the aggregate original amount of the term loan advances, divided by the exercise price of the Warrants.
The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2022.
The Company determined in accordance with ASC 480-10 that the initial tranche one advance of $10,000, the additional Term Loan advances available under tranches one, two, three and four and the warrants issued upon closing shall be accounted for as freestanding financial instruments as they are legally detachable and separately exercisable. The Company also determined in accordance with ASC 815-10 that the additional Term Loan advances available under tranches one, two, three and four do not qualify as derivative instruments and that the value associated with these commitments is immaterial.
Upon closing, the Company issued to Hercules warrants to purchase 36,718 shares of Company’s common stock and recognized the initial warrants at their relative fair value of $227 in shareholders equity. In accordance with ASC 815-40, the additional remaining warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at the closing of the Loan Agreement were recognized at their fair value of $41 as warrant liabilities given the variable settlement amount of the warrant shares. The additional remaining warrants under the Loan Agreement are considered an outstanding instrument at close of the Loan Agreement. The total fair value of $268 associated with these equity and liability classified warrants, is recognized as a debt discount and is being accreted into the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount using the effective interest rate method over the term of the loan payable. The Company reassesses the fair value of the warrant liability at the end of each prospective reporting period. The warrant liabilities were valued at $305 as of December 31, 2022. The change in fair value of the warrant liability of $264 from June 15, 2022 to December 31, 2022 arising from remeasurement was recorded in the statements of operations.

 8. Stock-based awards
2018 Stock option and grant plan
The Company’s 2018 Stock Option and Grant Plan (the “2018 Plan”) provided for the Company to grant incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. The 2018 Plan was administered by the board of directors or, at the discretion of the board of directors, by a committee of the board of directors. The exercise prices, vesting and other restrictions were determined at the discretion of the board of directors, or its committee if so delegated.
The total number of shares of common stock that could have been issued under the 2018 Plan was 3,071,960 shares, of which 107,635 shares remained available for grant on June 18, 2019, the date that the Company’s 2019 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”) became effective. Upon the effectiveness of the 2019 Plan, the 107,635 remaining shares available under the 2018 Plan were transferred and became available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. Shares of common stock underlying outstanding awards under the 2018 Plan that are forfeited, cancelled, held back upon exercise or settlement of an award to satisfy the exercise price or tax withholding, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance of stock, expire or are otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) will be added to the shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.
2019 Stock option and incentive plan
The 2019 Plan was adopted and approved by the Company’s board of directors in May 2019 and by the Company’s stockholders in June 2019. The 2019 Plan became effective on June 18, 2019 and replaced the Company’s 2018 Plan on that date. The 2019 Plan allows the board of directors or the compensation committee of the board of directors to make equity-based incentive awards to the Company’s officers, employees, directors or other key persons (including consultants). The number of shares initially reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan was 2,572,457, which included the 107,635 shares transferred from the 2018 Plan, and shall be cumulatively increased on each January 1 by 4% of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or such lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors or compensation committee of the board of directors. The 2019 Plan was increased by 1,389,665 shares on January 1, 2021 and by 1,396,029 shares on January 1, 2022.
The 2019 Plan is administered by the board of directors or, at the discretion of the board of directors, by a committee of the board of directors. The exercise prices, vesting and other restrictions are determined at the discretion of the board of directors, or its committee if so delegated, except that the exercise price per share of stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the share of common stock on the date of grant and the term of stock option may not be greater than ten years. All incentive options granted to any person possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares may not have an exercise price of less than 110% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. Stock options granted to employees, officers, members of the board of directors and consultants will typically vest over a four-year period.
Shares that are expired, terminated, surrendered or canceled under the 2019 Plan without having been fully exercised will be available for future awards.
2019 Employee stock purchase plan
The 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2019 ESPP”) was adopted and approved by the Company’s board of directors in May 2019 and by the Company’s stockholders in June 2019. The 2019 ESPP became effective on June 18, 2019, at which time 273,869 shares were reserved for issuance. The 2019 ESPP provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance will automatically increase each January 1, beginning on January 1, 2020 and each January 1 through January 1, 2029, by the least of (i) 1% of the outstanding number of shares of the Company’s common stock on the immediately preceding December 31, (ii) 410,803 shares or (iii) such number of shares as

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of the Company’s common stock for those stock options that had exercise prices lower than the fair value of the Company’s common stock.
The weighted average grant-date fair value per share of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $28.76 and $13.98, respectively.
Awards with performance-based vesting conditions granted under the 2019 Plan
In December 2021, the Company granted 610,546 stock options to management at an exercise price of $21.10, which vest upon the achievement on or before December 31, 2022 of three pre-determined milestones regarding progress related to the HARMONY study, progress related to the SYMMETRY study, and progress related to availability of drug product for use in Phase 3 clinical trials. One-third of the options vest upon achievement of each of the milestones. In January 2022, the Company granted an additional 248,376 stock options to Company employees with the same performance-based milestones and vesting terms at an exercise price of $21.70. In September 2022, two of the three performance-based awards milestones were achieved and were deemed vested. In December 2022, the third portion of the performance-based awards milestones was achieved and was deemed vested. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $10,487 of related stock compensation expense, based upon management's estimates of the probabilities of the milestones being achieved and the fully vesting of the performance awards.

 9. Amgen license agreement
In June 2018, the Company entered into a license agreement (the “Amgen Agreement”) with Amgen, Inc. (“Amgen”) pursuant to which the Company was granted an exclusive license to certain patents and intellectual property related to a long-acting FGF21 analog in order to commercially develop, manufacture, use and distribute FGF21 as a treatment for NASH and other serious metabolic diseases. The Amgen Agreement provides the Company with exclusive global rights to the licensed products and the right to grant sublicenses that cover EFX to third parties.
In exchange for these rights, the Company made an upfront payment of $5,000 and issued 2,653,333 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a fair value of $1,353 to Amgen. Amgen was also entitled to maintain a 10% ownership interest of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, on a fully diluted and converted basis, through the second closing of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock financing. In November 2018, in connection with the second closing of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock financing, the Company issued 3,205,128 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Amgen for a total value of $7,404, satisfying its anti-dilution obligation under the Amgen Agreement.
Under the Amgen Agreement, the Company made a milestone payment in the third quarter of 2019 of $2,500 in connection with dosing the first patient in the BALANCED study and is obligated to pay Amgen $7,500 in connection with dosing the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial, up to $30,000 in connection with marketing approvals, and aggregate milestone payments of up to $75,000 upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones for all products licensed under the Amgen Agreement.
 
Akero Therapeutics, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)
Under the Amgen Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Amgen tiered royalties ranging from a low to high single-digit percentages on annual net sales of the licensed products, beginning on the first commercial sale of such licensed products in each country and expiring on a country-by-country basis on the latest of (i) the expiration of the last valid patent claim covering such licensed products in such country, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity in such country, and (iii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. The royalty payments are subject to reduction under specified conditions set forth in the Amgen Agreement.
The Company is solely responsible for all development, manufacturing, and commercial activities and costs of the licensed products, including clinical studies or other tests necessary to support the use of a licensed product. The Company is also responsible for costs related to the filing, prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights.
The Amgen Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the royalty term in all countries for all licensed products. The Amgen Agreement may be terminated by either party with at least 90 days' notice in the event of material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days, by either party for insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party and immediately by Amgen if the Company challenges the licensed patents. The Company may also terminate the Amgen Agreement with 90 days' written notice for discretionary reasons such as scientific, technical, regulatory or commercial issues, as defined in the Amgen Agreement.
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record any research and development expense in connection with the Amgen Agreement.

 10. Income taxes
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded no income tax benefits for the net operating losses incurred or for the research and development tax credits generated in each period due to its uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. All of the Company’s operating losses since inception have been generated in the United States.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $248,406 and $235,472, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2037. The federal net operating loss carryforwards include $245,963, which may be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2022, the Company also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $8,827 and $1,249, respectively, which may be available to offset future tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2033. During the year ended December 31, 2022, gross deferred tax assets, before valuation allowance, increased by $41,837, due to the operating loss incurred by the Company during that period.
Utilization of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and corresponding provisions of state law, due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three‑year period. The annual limitation is determined by multiplying the value of the Company's stock at the time of such ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Such limitations may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL carryforwards before utilization. As of December 31, 2022, the Company determined that ownership changes occurred on March 24, 2017, June 7, 2018 and July 8, 2020. As a result of the ownership changes, approximately $2,118 and $3,632 of the NOLs will expire unutilized for federal and state purposes, respectively. The ability of the Company to use its remaining NOL carryforwards may be further limited if the Company experiences a Code Section 382 ownership change as a result of future changes in its stock ownership.

 The Company’s research and development credits are subject to Code Section 383 and are limited due to the ownership changes that the Company has experienced. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has derecognized approximately $87 and $43 of gross federal and state research and development credits, respectively. The Company has not derecognized any of the California research and development credit-related deferred tax assets because the credits do not expire.
The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon its ability to realize its deferred tax assets at each reporting period. In doing so, the Company has considered its history of cumulative net losses incurred and its lack of commercialization of any products or generation of any revenue from product sales and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Management reevaluates the positive and negative evidence at each reporting period.
Changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 related primarily to the increase in net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards and were as follows:

 | 2022 | | 2021
Valuation allowance as of January 1, | $ | (66,853 | ) | $ | (36,227 | )
Increases recorded to income tax provision | | — | | | — | 
Decreases recorded as a benefit to income tax provision | | (41,837 | ) | | (30,626 | )
Valuation allowance as of December 31, | $ | (108,690 | ) | $ | (66,853 | )

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $2,110, none of which if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in a future period, due to the Company's full valuation allowance on U.S. net deferred tax assets. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income taxes as part of its income tax provision. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions and no amounts had been recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company will file income tax returns in the U.S., California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia, as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company is subject to examination by federal and state jurisdictions, where applicable. There are currently no pending tax examinations. The Company is open to future tax examination under statute from 2018 to the present.
 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows


Balance at December 31, 2020 | $ | 644 
Increases related to prior year tax positions | | 66

On March 27, 2020, the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act” (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The Company analyzed the provisions of the Act and determined there was no significant impact to its income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 On June 29, 2020, California Governor signed Assembly Bill 85 (“A.B. 85”), which now becomes California law. A.B. 85, which includes several tax measures, provides for a three-year suspension of the use of net operating losses for medium and large businesses and a three-year cap on the use of business incentive tax credits to offset no more than $5,000 of tax per year. Generally, A.B. 85 suspends the use of net operating losses for taxable years 2020, 2021, and 2022 for taxpayers with taxable income of $1,000 or more.” On February 9, 2022, the California Governor signed into law CA SB 113 which shortens the previously enacted suspension on the use of NOLs and R&D credits. Accordingly, SB 113 restored NOL utilization and removes the R&D credit limitation for 2022, and as such no impact to the Company for the period ended December 31, 2022.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) included a change in the treatment of research and development expenditures for tax purposes under Section 174. Effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, specified R&D expenditures must undergo a 5-year amortization period for domestic spend and a 15-year amortization period for foreign spend, beginning with the midpoint of the taxable year in which such expenditures are paid or incurred. Prior to the effective date (2021 tax year and prior), taxpayers were able to immediately expense R&D costs under Section 174(a) or had the option to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures over a 5-year recovery period under Section 174(b). Accordingly, the Company is estimating 2022 capitalization of U.S R&D expenditures net of 2022 amortization of approximately $57,658 (an addback to estimated 2022 US taxable income). Additionally, the requirement to capitalize and amortize foreign R&D expenses over 15 years resulted in 2022 capitalization of R&D expenditures (net of amortization) of $14,728.
 On August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The IRA includes implementation of a new alternative minimum tax, an excise tax on stock buybacks, and significant tax incentives for energy and climate initiatives, among other provisions. The Company is evaluating the provisions included under the IRA and does not expect the provisions to have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
All tax returns will remain open for examination by the federal and state taxing authorities for three and four years, respectively, from the date of utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards or research and development credits.

 
11. Net loss per share
Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders was calculated as follows:


 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021
Numerator: | | | | 
Net loss | $ | 112,033 | | $ | 100,777 
Denominator: | | | | 
Weighted average common shares outstanding, basic and diluted | | 38,984,772 | | | 34,827,385
Net loss per share, basic and diluted | $ | 2.87 | | $ | 2.89 


The Company excluded nil shares and 8,127 shares of restricted common stock, presented on a weighted average basis, from the calculations of basic net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, because those shares had not vested.
The Company’s potentially dilutive securities, which include stock options, warrants and unvested restricted common stock, have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share is the same. The Company excluded the following potential common shares,

12. Commitments and contingencies
COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China and subsequently spread to other countries, including Europe and the United States, and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Despite progress with distribution and administration of vaccines, COVID-19 and its effects continue to evolve and countries including the United States, Europe and Asia continue to respond by implementing restrictions such as travel restrictions, social distancing requirements, stay-at-home orders and delayed commencement of non-COVID-19-related clinical trials. The Company’s financial results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not significantly impacted by COVID-19, however, the Company cannot at this time predict the specific extent, duration, or full impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will have on its financial condition, operations, and business plans for 2022, including the timing and enrollment of patients in its planned clinical trials and other expected milestones of its product candidate.
Operating lease
In February 2020, the Company entered into a seven-year agreement to occupy 6,647 square feet of office space in South San Francisco, California. The lease commenced on July 10, 2020 when the Company took occupancy of the leased space and the lease was determined to be operating classified. Under the agreement, the Company is required to make approximately $2,300 in total minimum payments during the term. The Company is also required to pay its proportionate share of building operating and tax costs after the first year under lease which are not included in the measurement of the lease and treated as variable lease cost and expensed when incurred.

As of December 31, 2022, maturities of the Company’s operating lease liability was as follows:

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had non-cancelable purchase and other commitments under these agreements totaling $7,239.
Indemnification agreements
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its board of directors and its executive officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications. The Company is not currently aware of any indemnification claims and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022.
Legal proceedings
The Company is not a party to any litigation and does not have contingency reserves established for any litigation liabilities. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates whether or not a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable under the provisions of the authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for contingencies. The Company expenses as incurred the costs related to such legal proceedings.
