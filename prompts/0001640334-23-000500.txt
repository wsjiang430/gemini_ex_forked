Corporate History

Our Company was incorporated on May 25, 2014 under the name “Formigli, Inc.” Our Company was originally formed with the intent to engage in the worldwide distribution of custom handmade Italian road bikes, made by Renzo Formigli.

On December 3, 2015, Amy Chaffe, our former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and founder, decided to conduct a corporate restructuring. Our Company filed Articles of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Florida Department of State whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by (i) changing our name to “Cloudweb, Inc.”, (ii) increasing our authorized number of shares of common stock from 100 million to 500 million, and (iii) increasing our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock by conducting a forward split of such shares at the rate of 100 shares for every one (1) share currently issued and outstanding and made submission to FINRA with respect to the corporate action and requested a change of ticker symbol to “CLOU”. Our Company’s common stock is quoted on the Pink Sheets of the OTC Markets, under the symbol “CLOW”, and first traded on the OTC Markets in November 2015.

On January 28, 2016, our Company concluded a Share Exchange Agreement entered into with Zhi De Liao (“Mr. Liao”), whereby our Company issued 2,500,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Liao in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Data Cloud Inc. a Nevada corporation (“Data Cloud”). Data Cloud owned 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Web Hosting Solutions Ltd., a United Kingdom Company (“WHS”), which it purchased from James Holland for US$72,000 (GBP 47,000) on November 25, 2015.

At the time WHS had been providing web hosting solutions for approximately ten (10) years and became a UK private limited Company in 2012. In connection with the Share Exchange Agreement, our Company elected to enter into the web hosting industry and discontinue our former business operations.

As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, Mr. Liao became our Company’s executive officer and sole member of the Board of Directors. Concurrently, Mr. Liao, through his controlled entity, Letterston Investments Ltd., acquired 250,000,000 shares of common stock from our former officer and director Ms. Amy Chaffe. As a result, on the transaction date, Mr. Liao effectively controlled approximately 81% of our Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.

On November 4, 2016, our Company filed Articles of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Florida Department of State whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by changing our name to “Data Backup Solutions, Inc.” On November 10, 2016, our Company filed Articles of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Florida Department of State whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by decreasing our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock by conducting a reverse split of such shares at the rate of 1 share for each one hundred shares (100) shares then currently issued and outstanding. The submission of the change of name to Data Backup Solutions, Inc. and the reverse stock split was not completed and the submission was closed.

Prior to the Closing, Data Backup owned 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Data Cloud which owns 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of WHS,.
