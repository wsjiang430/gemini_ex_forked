Item 1. Business
Overview
Zscaler’s mission is to provide fast, secure and reliable access to information no matter where it lives. 
We were incorporated in 2007, during the early stages of cloud adoption and mobility, based on a vision that the internet would become the new corporate network as the cloud becomes the new data center. We predicted that with rapid cloud adoption and increasing workforce mobility, traditional perimeter security approaches would provide inadequate protection for users and data and an increasingly poor user experience. We pioneered a security cloud that represents a fundamental shift in the architectural design and approach to network security. 
Enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud to achieve greater IT agility, a faster pace of innovation and lower costs. Organizations are increasingly relying on internet destinations for a range of business activities, adopting new external SaaS applications for critical business functions and moving their internally managed applications to the public cloud, or IaaS. Enterprise users now expect to be able to seamlessly access applications and data, wherever they are hosted, from any device, anywhere in the world. We believe these trends are indicative of the broader digital transformation agenda, as businesses increasingly succeed or fail based on their IT outcomes. 
We believe that securing the on-premises corporate network to protect users and data is becoming increasingly irrelevant in a cloud and mobile-first world where organizations depend on the internet, a network they do not control and cannot secure, to access critical applications that power their businesses. We pioneered a new approach to security that connects the right user to the right application, regardless of network. Our cloud platform, which delivers security as a service, eliminates the need for traditional on-premises security appliances that are difficult to maintain and require compromises between security, cost and user experience. Our cloud platform incorporates the security functionality needed to enable users to safely utilize authorized applications and services based on an organization’s policies. Our solution is a purpose-built, multi-tenant, distributed cloud security platform that secures access for users and devices to applications and services, regardless of location. 
Before our platform, the corporate data center served as the central hub of IT security, with a physical network perimeter used to separate corporate users, devices and applications from the internet. Today, the network perimeter consists of appliances that have become fundamentally less effective as applications, data, users and devices rapidly move off the corporate network, making the notion of a corporate perimeter obsolete. In a world where more companies are shifting their most critical IT assets to the cloud, cloud-first security is required. Our architecture is vastly different from the traditional “hub-and-spoke” corporate perimeter, where traffic from branch offices is routed to centralized data centers for security scanning and policy enforcement before reaching its destination. In contrast, our security cloud sits between an organization’s users and devices, and the internet, inspecting traffic on a direct path to the destination. Our solutions enable customers to set policies that follow users, so a consistent level of protection is applied no matter where users are located or how they are connected to the internet. We provide all of this security at scale, processing approximately 70 billion internet requests per day. Our platform eliminates the need for organizations to buy and manage a variety of appliances that need to be maintained by a large number of highly skilled security personnel, who are expensive and in increasingly short supply. 
Our multi-tenant architecture is distributed across over 150 data centers globally, which allows us to secure users across 185 countries. Each day, we block over 100 million threats and perform over 120,000 unique security updates. Our customers benefit from the network effect of our growing cloud because once a new threat is detected, it can be blocked for users across our entire customer base within minutes.

Our customers protect their users by routing their internet traffic through our cloud platform. Some of the largest enterprises and government agencies in the world rely on our solutions to help them accelerate their move to the cloud. We have over 3,900 customers across all major geographies, with an emphasis on larger organizations, and we currently count over 400 of the Forbes Global 2000 as customers. Our customers span every major industry, including airlines and transportation, conglomerates, consumer goods and retail, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media and communications, public sector and education, technology and telecommunications services. 
We have experienced significant growth, with revenue increasing from $125.7 million in fiscal 2017 to $190.2 million in fiscal 2018 to $302.8 million in fiscal 2019, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 51% and 59%, respectively. We experienced net losses of $28.7 million, $33.6 million and $35.5 million in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. We expect we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.
Our Solutions and Platform 
Our purpose-built cloud security platform offers two principal services built natively in the cloud.
Zscaler Internet Access 
Our Zscaler Internet Access solution, or ZIA, was designed to securely connect users to externally managed applications, including SaaS applications and internet destinations regardless of device, location or network. Our ZIA solution provides inline content inspection and firewall access controls across all ports and protocols to protect organizations and users from external threats as well as protecting an organization’s data from leaking out. Policies follow the user to provide identical protection on any device, regardless of location; any policy changes are enforced for users worldwide. Our cloud security platform provides full inline content inspection of webpages to assess and correlate the risk of webpage objects, continuously discovering and blocking sophisticated threats. 
Our ZIA solution includes broad functionality, which we categorize by three areas: 
Access Control 
The access control functionality of our ZIA solution enforces access and usage policies to externally managed applications, including SaaS application and internet destinations. This provides functionality that has traditionally been provided by stand-alone point products. 
•Cloud Firewall: Our cloud firewall was designed to protect users by inspecting internet traffic on all ports and protocols, and it offers user level policies, application identification with deep packet inspection and intrusion prevention. 
•URL Filtering: Our URL filtering capability enables customers to enforce acceptable usage policies and protects organizations from users visiting unauthorized websites or illegally downloading content that can increase liability and impact their brand. 
•Bandwidth Control: Our bandwidth control and traffic shaping capabilities ensure that business critical applications are prioritized over non-business critical applications, improving productivity and user experience. By enforcing quality of service in the cloud, our platform can optimize “last-mile” utilization of a customer’s network, providing significant value. 
•DNS Filtering: Our Domain Name System, or DNS, filtering solution provides a local DNS resolver and enforces acceptable use policies.

Threat Prevention 
Our second area of functionality, threat prevention, protects users from threats using a range of approaches and techniques. Our robust threat prevention capabilities provide multiple layers of protection to prevent cyberattacks. We provide functionality that traditionally has been offered by disparate, stand-alone products. 
•Advanced Threat Protection: Our advanced protection solution delivers real-time protection from malicious internet content like browser exploits, scripts, zero-pixel iFrames, malware and botnet callbacks. Over 120,000 unique security updates are performed every day to the Zscaler cloud to keep users protected. Once we detect a new threat to a user, we block it for all users. We call this the “cloud security effect.” 
•Cloud Sandbox: Our cloud sandbox enables enterprises to block zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats, or APTs, by analyzing unknown files for malicious behavior, and it can scale to every user regardless of location. Our sandbox was designed and built to be multi-tenant and allows customers to determine which traffic should be sent to the cloud sandbox. As an integrated cloud security platform, customers can set policies by users and destinations to prevent patient-zero scenarios by holding, detonating and analyzing suspicious files in the sandbox before being sent to the user. 
•Anti-Virus: Our anti-virus technology uses a signature database of files and objects on the internet known to be unsafe and runs traffic through multiple anti-virus engines in a single pass. 
•DNS Security: Our DNS security blocks access to known malicious sites, including command and control sites, and routes suspicious traffic to our threat detection engines for content inspection. 
Data Protection 
Our third area of functionality, data protection, prevents unauthorized sharing or exfiltration of confidential information, reducing our customers’ business and compliance risk. 
•Data Loss Protection: Our data loss protection enables enterprises to use standard or custom dictionaries using efficient pattern-matching algorithms to easily scale to all users and traffic, including compressed or encrypted traffic, to prevent, monitor or block unauthorized or sensitive data exfiltration. Our exact data match or EDM functionality significantly improves the accuracy and efficacy of our data loss prevention solution by enabling our customers to populate a custom database scaling to billions of unique fields. These fields may contain, for example, personally identifiable information like credit card or social security numbers, that our customers want to protect. 
•Cloud Application Control: Our cloud application control allows enterprises to discover and granularly control user access to known and unknown cloud applications. By doing SSL interception at scale, we provide malware protection, data loss prevention and similar Cloud Access Security Broker, or CASB, functions that can be performed inline, for specific sanctioned applications. Business policies can be defined with granular access control for specified cloud applications, such as the ability to upload or download files or post comments or videos based on different user or group identity. We partner with specific CASB vendors to extend their policy controls and visibility of out-of-band cloud applications. 
•File Type Controls: Our file type control allows policies to be defined that control which file types are allowed to be downloaded and uploaded based on application, user, location and destination.

Zscaler Private Access 
Our Zscaler Private Access solution, or ZPA, was designed to provide secure access to internally managed applications, either hosted internally in data centers, private or public clouds. Our ZPA solution was designed around four key tenants that fundamentally change the way users access internal applications: 
•connect users to applications without bringing users on the network; 
•never expose applications to the internet; 
•segment access to applications without relying on traditional approach of network segmentation; and 
•provide remote access over the internet without virtual private networks, or VPNs.
Our ZPA solution enforces a global policy engine that manages access to internally managed applications regardless of location. If access is granted to a user, our ZPA solution connects the user’s device only to the authorized application without exposing the identity or location of the application. Hence applications are not exposed to the internet, further limiting threat exposure. This results in reduced cost and complexity, while offering better security and an improved user experience. 
ZPA functionality falls in three major areas: 
•Secure Application Access: Our ZPA solution delivers seamless connectivity to internally managed applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, enterprise data center, or both. Administrators can set global policies from a single console, enabling policy-driven access that is agnostic to the network the users are on. By creating seamless access to applications regardless of a user’s network, our ZPA solution subsumes the need for traditional remote access VPNs, Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, VPNs, reverse proxies and other similar products. 
•Application Segmentation: This fundamentally new architecture provides capabilities that enable user and application level segmentation, a vast improvement over traditional network segmentation. As each user-to-application connection is segmented with microtunnels, each of which is a temporary session between a specific user and a specific application, lateral movement across the network is prevented which significantly reduces security risk. Similar to CASB application discovery reports for internet applications, our ZPA solution provides granular discovery of internally managed applications to aid the creation of segmentation policies. Because our ZPA solution sits on the application layer and is name- or domain-based, organizations can quickly and easily identify the internally-managed applications that are running and then easily provision appropriate policies. Microtunnels subsume the need for internal firewalls, which are required for protecting against lateral malware propagation from machine to machine, and traditional network access control functionality since users are granted access only to applications for which they have permission and are not granted full access to the network. 
•Application Protection: Our ZPA solution initiates and connects together outbound-only links between authenticated users and internally managed applications using microtunnels. Access is provided to users without bringing them onto the corporate network and without exposing applications to the internet. Internally managed applications are not discoverable or identifiable. With no inbound connections and no public IP addresses, there is no inbound attack surface and therefore no threat of distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks. With our innovative approach, we subsume the need for a next-generation firewall. Similarly, by completely removing the need for an exposed IP address or DNS to the internet, we subsume the functionality of DDoS mitigation systems.

The primary use cases for our ZPA solution includes: 
•VPN replacement; 
•providing non-employees with secure access to internal applications; 
•direct-to-cloud access to internally managed applications hosted in public cloud environments, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform; and 
•access to applications following a merger or acquisition by providing named users with access to named applications, without the need to merge networks. 
Our Technology and Architecture 
Zscaler is driven by technology and innovation. We developed a highly scalable, multi-tenant, globally distributed cloud capable of providing inline inspection that offers a full range of enterprise network security services. We designed and built a purpose-built three-tier architecture starting with our core operating system and adding layers of security and networking innovations over time. Our cloud platform is protected by more than 130 issued and pending patents. Our cloud is distributed across more than 150 data centers on five continents and processes approximately 70 billion requests per day from users across 185 countries. 
The platform is designed to be resilient, redundant and high-performing. Our platform is built as software modules that run on standard x86 platforms without any dependency on custom hardware. The platform modules are split into the control plane (Zscaler Central Authority), the enforcement plane (Zscaler Enforcement Nodes) and the logging and statistics plane (Zscaler Nanolog Servers) as described below:
•Zscaler Central Authority: The Zscaler Central Authority monitors our entire security cloud and provides a central location for software and database updates, policy and configuration settings and threat intelligence. The collection of Zscaler Central Authority instances together act like the brain of the cloud, and they are geographically distributed for redundancy and performance. 
•Zscaler Enforcement Nodes: Customer traffic gets directed to the nearest Zscaler Enforcement Node, where security, management and compliance policies served by the Zscaler Central Authority are enforced. The Zscaler Enforcement Node also incorporates our differentiated authentication and policy distribution mechanism that enables any user to connect to any Zscaler Enforcement Node at any time to ensure full policy enforcement. The Zscaler Enforcement Node utilizes a full proxy architecture and is built to ensure data is not written to disk to maintain the highest level of data security. Data is scanned in RAM only and then erased. Logs are continuously created in memory and forwarded to our logging module. 
•Zscaler Nanolog Servers: Our Nanolog technology is built into the Zscaler Enforcement Node to perform lossless compression of logs, enabling our platform to collect over 70 terabytes of unique raw log data every day. Logs are transmitted to our Nanolog Servers over secure connections and multicast to multiple servers for redundancy. Our dashboards provide visibility into our customer’s traffic to enable troubleshooting, policy changes and other administrative actions. Our analytics capabilities allow customers to interactively mine billions of transaction logs to generate reports that provide insight on network utilization and traffic. We do not rely on batch reporting; we continuously update our dashboards and reporting and can stream logs to a third-party Security Information and Event Management, or SIEM, service as they arrive. Regardless of where users are located, customers can choose to have logs stored in the United States, the European Union or Switzerland.

Our platform is a critical integration point positioned in the data path providing secure access to the internet, cloud and internal applications. We complement and interoperate with key technology vendors across major market segments, including software-defined networking in a wide area network, or SD-WAN, identity and access management, device and endpoint management, as well as SIEM for reporting and analytics. Many of these vendors, like us, were developed in the cloud and together provide a foundation for a modern access and security architecture. 
Growth Strategies 
The growing use of the internet and the increasing adoption of the cloud and mobility are driving network and application transformation. As a provider of a fully integrated, multi-tenant cloud security solution, we enable our customers to accelerate this secure transformation to the cloud and believe we are uniquely positioned to maximize value as they undertake these transitions. Key elements of our growth strategy include: 
•Continue to win new customers. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand our customer base, both in the United States and internationally. We have invested significantly in our sales and marketing organization to execute against this opportunity. 
•Expand in existing customers. We plan to leverage a land-and-expand approach with our existing customers to sell subscriptions to additional users, additional suites that contain more functionality and a la carte services. 
•Leverage channel partners to participate in cloud transformation initiatives. We have invested in establishing long-standing relationships with global telecommunications service providers and are expanding our network of global system integrators and regional telecommunications service providers.
•Expansion and innovation of services. We continue to invest in research and development and acquire new technologies and products in order to add new and differentiated solutions to our existing product portfolio and to improve the overall functionality, reliability, availability and scalability of our cloud security platform. 
•Expansion into additional market segments. We are targeting the expansion of our immediate addressable market, emphasizing U.S. federal government agencies in the near- to medium-term as well as additional international markets such as Japan and the Asia Pacific region.
•Extend our platform to third-party developers. We intend to open our cloud security platform to third-party developers and vendors to offer new functionality and solutions that may target specific use cases, verticals and niche requirements.

Sales and Marketing
Although we have a channel sales model, we use a joint sales approach in which our sales force develops relationships directly with our customers, and together with our channel account teams, works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. Our customer care and success teams maintain high-touch relationships with our customers to deploy and manage our cloud platform, identify, analyze and resolve performance issues and respond to security threats. We believe customer service touchpoints are opportunities to further develop our relationship with our customers and potentially generate incremental revenue through the addition of new users and services. 
Our channel partners consist of global telecommunications service provider, system integrator and value-added reseller partners, and we leverage their relationships to expand our reach, improve procurement and accelerate customer fulfillment. 
We enter into agreements with our channel partners in the ordinary course of business. The contracts typically have a one-year term and renew automatically, subject to cancellation by either party upon 90 days’ notice. These agreements contain standard commercial terms and conditions, including payment terms, billing frequency, warranties and indemnification. Our channel partners generally place purchase orders with us after receiving orders from customers. We generally maintain privity of contract with customers through end user subscription agreements. 
We expect to continue investing in our channel partners as we provide them with education, training and programs, including supporting their independent sales of our solutions. We believe that such investment, and investments in our sales force, will lead to significant expansion in our customer base, which will materially impact our business and results of operations. 
Our marketing strategy is focused on platform and brand awareness, which drives our opportunity pipeline and customer demand. This strategy is account-based, enabling us to pursue targeted marketing activities across both digital and non-digital channels. We anticipate increasing our marketing team headcount and are investing in programs designed to elevate our brand in the market and engage new enterprise accounts. We also participate in a number of cloud and security industry events. In addition, we have a deeply integrated ecosystem of channel partners, with whom we engage in joint marketing activities. 
Data Center Operations 
We operate our services across more than 150 data centers around the world, which are built to be highly resilient, have multiple levels of redundancy and provide failover to other data centers in our network. Our data centers are co-located within top-tier internet interconnection hubs that have direct connectivity, known as peering, to major telecommunication service providers, SaaS providers, public cloud providers, internet content providers and popular internet destinations. A number of our data centers are also located with our service provider partners. Our platform has received ISO 27001 certification since 2014. 
Research and Development 
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, operation and quality of our cloud platform. In addition to improving on our features, functionality and scalability, this organization works closely with our cloud operations team to ensure that our platform is reliable, available and scalable. ThreatLabZ, our internal team of security experts, researchers and network engineers, analyzes the global threat landscape, works to eliminate threats across our cloud platform and reports on emerging security issues. 
Table of Contents

Research and development expense was $62.0 million, $39.4 million and $33.6 million for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Our research and development leadership team is based in San Jose, California, and we also maintain research and development centers in India and Canada. 
Competition 
The market for security solutions is defined by changing technologies, an evolving threat landscape and complex enterprise needs. Our competitors and potential competitors include legacy on-premises appliance vendors across a number of categories: 
•independent IT security vendors, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., Fortinet, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and Symantec Corporation, which offer a broad mix of network and endpoint security products; 
•large networking vendors, such as Cisco Systems, Inc. and Juniper Networks, Inc., which offer security appliances and incorporate security capabilities in their networking products; 
•companies such as FireEye, Inc., Forcepoint Inc. (previously, Websense, Inc.), F5 Networks, Inc. and Pulse Secure, LLC with point solutions that compete with some of the features of our cloud platform, such as proxy, firewall, sandboxing and advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, encryption, load balancing and VPN; and 
•other providers of IT security services that offer, or may leverage related technologies to introduce, products that compete with or are alternatives to our cloud platform. 
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include: 
•delivering security from the cloud regardless of location of the user; 
•platform features, effectiveness and extensibility; 
•platform reliability, availability and scalability; 
•rapid development and delivery of new capabilities and services; 
•ability to integrate with other participants in the security and networking ecosystem; 
•price, total cost of ownership and network cost savings; 
•brand awareness, reputation and trust in the provider’s services; 
•strength of sales, marketing and channel partner relationships; and 
•quality of customer support. 
We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. Our cloud platform integrates many of the point products offered by our competitors and potential competitors, which is a key differentiator. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks, more diverse product and services offerings and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our services, including through selling at zero or negative margins, offering concessions,

product bundling or maintaining closed technology platforms. Further, many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their appliance-based network security architecture, and may not be willing or ready to abandon those historical investments. As our market grows and rapidly changes, we expect it will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new products and services. In addition, we may expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets. 
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights. As of July 31, 2019, we had over 130 total issued and pending patents, including in excess of 80 issued patents, in the United States and other countries. Our issued patents expire between 2028 and 2036 and cover various aspects of our cloud platform. In addition, we have registered “Zscaler” as a trademark in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we have registered other trademarks and filed other trademark applications in the United States. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “Zscaler” and similar variations. In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment or similar agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights through provisions in our subscription and license agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition to our internally developed technology, we also license software, including open source software, from third parties that we integrate into or bundle with our cloud platform. 
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third-parties may also claim that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies and non-practicing entities, have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers or channel partners, with whom our license or other agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third-party could prevent us from offering certain services or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected subscriptions or services, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly higher profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. See “Risk Factors-Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights, or other lawsuits asserted against us, could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects” for additional information. 
Employees 
We had approximately 1,480 employees worldwide as of July 31, 2019. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or are party to any collective bargaining arrangement. In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We may be required to comply with the terms of these collective bargaining agreements.
