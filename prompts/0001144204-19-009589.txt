Marketing and Product Development
 
The Company makes a substantial investment in product development and brand marketing to differentiate its product line from its competition. We conduct market research and development efforts to design products which satisfy existing and emerging consumer needs. The Company markets directly to the consumer or end-user as well as through its retail partners in the form of advertising and other promotional allowances.
Competition
 
Escalade is subject to competition with various manufacturers in each product line. The Company is not aware of any other single company that is engaged in the same product lines as Escalade or that produces the same range of products as Escalade. Nonetheless, competition exists for many Escalade products. Some competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company. Escalade believes that its long-term success depends on its ability to strengthen its relationship with existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products that satisfy the quality and price requirements of sporting goods customers.
Licenses, Trademarks and Brand Names
 
The Company has an agreement and contract with STIGA Sports AB for the exclusive right and license to distribute and produce table tennis equipment under the brand name STIGA® for North America. The Company also owns several registered trademarks and brand names including but not limited to Goalrilla™, Goalsetter®, Bear® Archery, Ping-Pong®, The Step®, Lifeline® and Woodplay®.
Backlog and Seasonality
 
Sales are based primarily on standard purchase orders and in most cases orders are shipped within the same month received. Unshipped orders at the end of the fiscal year (backlog) were not material and therefore are not an indicator of future results. Due to diversity in product categories, revenues have not been seasonal and are not expected to be so in the future.
Employees
 
The number of employees at December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 were as follows:
