Item 1. Business
Overview
Morningstar, Inc. is a leading provider of independent investment research in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. Our core competencies are data, research, and design, and we employ each of these to create products that clearly convey complex investment information to investors of all kinds. We started with affordable publications for individuals, then moved to creating technology solutions for professionals to help them research and select investments for clients. Today, we offer a suite of cloud-based solutions that serve individuals, financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and institutional investors in the private capital markets. In addition, we apply our valuation-based investing approach to managing assets for clients who prefer not to make investment decisions themselves. Since our founding in 1984, we’ve expanded our presence in global markets where investors need an independent view they can trust.
We help investors in two simple ways. First, we support individual investors and financial professionals who make their own investment decisions with an extensive product line of web-based tools, investment data, and research that helps investors make the most suitable choices and recommendations. Our customers have access to a wide selection of fundamental equity research, manager research, credit ratings, and private capital markets research directly on our proprietary desktop or web-based software platforms, through subscriptions, data feeds, and third-party distributors. 
Second, we provide investment management services, investment analysis platforms, and portfolio management and accounting software tools to advisors and financial institutions. Our managed portfolio offerings help financial institutions deliver investor-friendly products based on our valuation-driven, goals-based approach to investing. Applying our expertise in asset allocation, investment selection, and portfolio construction, our global investment team creates long-term investment strategies built on Morningstar’s expertise. We help retirement plan sponsors build high-quality savings programs for employees. Our financial technology solutions allow advisors to continually demonstrate their value to clients, from creating an initial investment proposal to reporting portfolio performance and providing automated rebalancing tools.
As of December 31, 2018, we served approximately 255,000 financial advisors, 1,500 asset management firms, 30 retirement plan providers, 248,000 retirement plans, and 10 million individual investors. We also provide data on the private capital markets to approximately 3,700 institutional clients. 
Our independence and our history of innovation make us a trusted resource for investors. While other companies may offer research, ratings, data, software products, or investment management services, we are one of the few companies that can deliver all of these with the best interest of the investor in mind. We believe putting investors first, paired with the way we use information design and technology to communicate complex financial information, sets us apart from our peers in the financial services industry.
Morningstar covers a wide range of investment offerings, including managed investment products, publicly listed companies, fixed-income securities, private capital markets, and real-time global market data. We focus our data and research efforts on several different areas:
Manager research (including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, separate accounts, and other vehicles) 
We’ve been providing independent analyst research on managed investment strategies since the mid-1980s. We use this analysis to provide research reports and qualitative, forward-looking Morningstar Analyst Ratings for approximately 4,800 funds, ETFs, and separately managed accounts globally. We also publish qualitative research and ratings on state-sponsored college savings plans, target-date funds, and health-savings accounts. This analysis augments other quantitative ratings and analytics, such as the Morningstar Rating for funds (the “star rating”), which ranks managed investment strategies such as mutual funds based on their past performance versus peers. In addition, the Morningstar Style Box visually depicts a strategy’s underlying investment style, making it easier to compare investments and build portfolios. The star rating and style box have become important tools that millions of investors and advisors use in making investment decisions. 
3

In recent years, we’ve launched several new ratings. The Morningstar Sustainability Rating helps investors evaluate funds based on environmental, social, and governance factors. Morningstar now provides Sustainability Ratings for approximately 45,000 investment vehicles. The Morningstar Quantitative Rating is a forward-looking rating that uses algorithmic techniques to evaluate mutual funds. It employs machine-learning to infer patterns in the way Morningstar’s manager-research analysts assign ratings to funds and then applies those learnings to rate funds the analysts don’t cover. It significantly expands the breadth of our forward-looking ratings.
As of December 31, 2018, we had about 120 manager research analysts globally, including teams in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.
Equity research
As part of our research efforts on individual stocks, we popularized the concepts of economic moat, a measure of competitive advantage originally developed by Warren Buffett, and margin of safety, which reflects the size of the discount in a stock's price relative to its estimated value. The Morningstar Rating for stocks is based on the stock's current price relative to our analyst-generated fair value estimates, as well as the company's level of business risk and economic moat. Our analysts cover approximately 1,500 companies using a consistent, proprietary methodology that focuses on fundamental analysis, competitive advantage assessment, and intrinsic value estimation. Morningstar’s data and research on publicly traded companies is used extensively in products throughout the company, such as institutional equity research, Morningstar Indexes such as the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index, our Global Market Barometer, and as a basis for equity portfolio strategies used in our managed portfolios. 
PitchBook, which we acquired in December 2016, focuses on private capital markets. PitchBook Analyst Research taps into proprietary data, such as valuations, deal multiples, and fund returns, to deliver analysis that allows clients to quickly gauge trends, map industries, and identify notable company sets in the private capital markets. In 2017, we integrated our publicly traded company fundamental data into the PitchBook platform, allowing institutional investors to better evaluate opportunities in both public and private markets. Morningstar's institutional equity research is also available on the PitchBook platform.
As of December 31, 2018, we had about 110 public equity analysts and 20 private equity analysts globally, making us one of the largest providers of independent equity research. In addition to our analyst-driven coverage, we provide quantitative ratings and reports for approximately 55,000 publicly traded companies globally. These quantitative public equity ratings draw on the fundamental research of our equity analyst team and provide a forward-looking statistical view of the valuation, competitive advantage, and level of uncertainty for stocks that are often under-followed by other research firms.
Credit ratings
Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC, our credit ratings subsidiary, is a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) that is focused on structured finance and credit ratings for corporate issuers and financial institutions. We bring transparency, unique perspectives, and superior client service to investors across the fixed-income markets. We provide new issue and surveillance ratings and analysis for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), and other types of asset-backed securities (ABS), as well as credit ratings on corporate and financial issuers and their individual debt issuances. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had about 70 U.S.-based credit analysts.
Portfolio advice methodologies 
Since our beginning, Morningstar has provided individual investors with tools to monitor their own investments, such as the Ownership Zone, Sector Delta, and Portfolio X-Ray. These do-it-yourself applications allow investors to see how different investments work together to form a portfolio and to track its progress.
4

We also continue to improve our total wealth approach to investing and asset allocation capabilities, which are mainly used in the investment management products we offer to professional investors. We also look for ways to infuse these capabilities into decision support tools. Whereas traditional asset allocation methodologies focus solely on financial assets (such as stocks and bonds), our investment management group has developed methodologies that provide a more holistic view of all sources of wealth, including financial capital, human capital, housing assets, and retirement and pension benefits. Our investment management group offers in-depth advice on asset allocation, portfolio construction, and security selection to meet the needs of investors and professionals looking for integrated portfolio solutions. We’ve also published research on "gamma," an innovative measure that quantifies how much additional retirement income investors can generate by making better financial planning decisions. 
The following graphics describe some of our portfolio advice methodologies in greater detail:

Our Mission
Our mission is to empower investor success. Everything we do at Morningstar is in the service of the investor. The investing ecosystem is complex and navigating it with confidence requires a trusted, independent voice. Our perspective--built every day by more than 5,000 employees across the globe--is delivered to institutions, advisors, and individuals with a single-minded purpose: to empower every investor with the conviction that he or she can make better-informed decisions and realize success on his or her own terms.
Our Strategy 
Our strategy is to deliver insights and experiences to clients that are essential to investing. Proprietary data sets, meaningful analytics, independent research and effective investment strategies are at the core of the powerful digital solutions that investors across client segments rely on.
We execute our strategy through four connected elements: our people, our work, our clients, and our brand. The interaction between these four elements has enabled Morningstar to establish a position in the industry that is differentiated from our competition. We believe that our intangible assets, including the strength of our brand and our unique intellectual property, are difficult for competitors to replicate. Additionally, we strive to ensure our customers receive demonstrable value from our solutions causing them to be reluctant to undertake the cost of switching to other providers.
Trends Defining Our Business
We are focusing our strategy plan around three secular trends that are shaping the investment industry and defining the solutions we expect our customers to demand in the future.
Investors embracing a new generation of solutions require differentiated data, research, and analytics
A new generation of approaches and technologies is creating simpler and more personal experiences for the end investor. Established financial solution providers are competing against both startups and diversifying competitors to provide these experiences. Data and analytics are driving this trend, and we are well-positioned to provide these resources.
Investors demand advice providers deliver more value to earn their fees
This change in investor expectations is driving change for all participants across the financial services industry. Therefore, we are focused on delivering digitized advice solutions that enable advisors to become more efficient, allowing them to allocate more time to the highest value activities. As part of this, we anticipate that investment decisions by all market participants will increasingly be influenced by third-party expertise and that the importance of financial planning will continue to grow.
Convergence of public and private markets
The private markets have become increasingly important and are influencing the public markets more than ever. Private companies are currently staying private longer, leading to a structurally lower level of public companies and the shift of a large portion of company capital (market capitalization) out of the public view. In response, new insights and solutions will be required to help sophisticated investors and their service providers navigate investment strategies that will be increasingly reliant on both public and private investment opportunities. Our unique ability to combine our leading private market data and insights along with our expanding public market data coverage puts us in a position to capitalize on this market convergence.
Major Customer Groups
Given our strategy and core capabilities discussed above, we focus on five primary customer groups:

• | Advisor (including independent financial advisors and those affiliated with broker/dealers or other intermediaries);


• | Asset management (including fund companies, insurance companies, and other companies that build and manage portfolios of securities for their clients);


• | Workplace/retirement (including retirement plan providers and plan sponsors);


• | Individual investor; and


• | Private market/venture capital investors.

Advisor
Financial advisors work with individual investors to help them reach their financial goals. This customer group includes independent advisors at registered investment advisor (RIA) firms, advisors affiliated with independent broker/dealers, dually registered advisors, and “captive” advisors who are employees of a broker/dealer. These broker/dealers include wirehouses, regional broker/dealers, and banks. The advisor landscape is broad in both the U. S. and in other parts of the world where we focus. Our largest market is the U.S., where Cerulli Associates estimates there were almost 312,000 financial advisors as of the end of 2018.
We believe our deep understanding of individual investors’ needs allows us to work with advisors to help them make more efficient use of their time and deliver better investment outcomes for their clients. Our advisor solutions also draw on Morningstar’s proprietary investment research methodologies and research insights.
We sell our advisor-related solutions both directly to independent financial advisors and through enterprise licenses, which allow financial advisors associated with the licensing firm to use our products.
We are expanding the range of services we offer to help financial advisors with all aspects of their daily workflow needs, including investment decision-making, portfolio construction, client monitoring and reporting, practice management, portfolio rebalancing that connects with custodial and trading interfaces, and financial planning. Because advisors are increasingly outsourcing investment management, we're continuing to enhance Morningstar Managed Portfolios to help advisors save time and reduce compliance risk.
Our main products for financial advisors are Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Office, and Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
Asset management
Asset management firms manufacture financial products and manage and distribute investment portfolios. We estimate that there are more than 3,200 asset management firms globally, ranging from large, global firms to firms with small fund lineups and operations in a single market or region. The asset management customer group includes individuals involved in sales, marketing, product development, business intelligence, and distribution, as well as investment management (often referred to as the “buy side”), which includes portfolio management and research.
Our asset management offerings help companies connect with their clients because of Morningstar’s strong brand presence with both financial advisors and individual investors. We offer a global reach and have earned investors’ trust in our unbiased approach, investor-centric mission, and thought leadership.
The key products we offer for asset management firms include Morningstar Direct for Asset Management, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Indexes. For the buy side, key products include Morningstar Research, Morningstar Credit Ratings, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Direct.
Workplace/retirement
In the U.S., 401(k) retirement plans and other defined contribution (DC) plan types, such as 403(b)s and the Thrift Savings Plan, are becoming the dominant plan type offered by employers. According to the Investment Company Institute, there were $8.1 trillion in assets in DC plans at end of the third quarter of 2018, compared to $3.2 trillion in private-sector defined benefit (DB) plans and $6.1 trillion in government DB plans.
DC plans are now helping millions of workers in the U.S. save for retirement and significant strides have been made to roll out automated plan design features, such as auto-enrollment and auto-savings increases. The industry continues to struggle to boost employee savings rates and retirement readiness. We believe that a significant market exists for solutions, such as our managed accounts offering, that are designed to address these shortcomings by providing personalized advice that helps individuals build assets for retirement and beyond. 
9

Other countries continue to follow in the footsteps of the U.S., abandoning traditional DB plans and pensions in favor of DC-focused solutions that shift saving for retirement from the employer to employee. Currently, our main focus is the U.S. market as it continues to demonstrate healthy growth and still rewards investment. Additionally, many of our solutions are not easily adapted to foreign markets due to significant differences in regulatory frameworks that govern retirement saving and investing. 
Our retirement solutions primarily reach individual investors through employers (plan sponsors) that offer DC plans for their employees. We can work directly with plan sponsors to help them design a suitable retirement program, but more typically, we deliver our retirement solutions through retirement plan providers that package our advice and investment lineups with administrative and record-keeping services. We recently expanded into the broker/dealer market by developing a solution called Morningstar Plan Advantage that helps advisors grow their retirement plan book of business. 
Our main product offerings for the workplace/retirement customer group include managed retirement accounts, fiduciary services, and custom models.
Individual investors
We offer tools and content for individual investors who invest to build wealth and save for other goals, such as retirement or college tuition. A Gallup survey released in April 2018 found that approximately 55% of individuals in the U.S. invest in the stock market either directly, through mutual funds, or self-directed retirement plans. We design most of our products for individual investors who are actively involved in the investing process and want to take charge of their own investment decisions. We also reach individuals who want to learn more about investing or want to validate the advice they receive from brokers or financial advisors. 
Our main product for individual investors is Morningstar.com, which can be accessed via desktop, tablet, or mobile phone applications, and includes both paid Premium Memberships and free content available to registered users and visitors. We also reach individual investors through licensing our content to other websites, such as Yahoo Finance, MSN Money, and Google Finance.
Private market/venture capital investors
Through PitchBook, we reach approximately 3,700 investment and research firms and their service providers, including venture capital and private equity firms, corporate development teams, investment banks, limited partners, lenders, law firms, and accounting firms. 
PitchBook covers the full lifecycle of venture capital, private equity, and M&A, including the limited partners, investment funds, and service providers involved. Our main product for this customer group is the PitchBook Platform, an all-in-one research and analysis workstation that gives clients the ability to access data, discover new connections, and conduct research on potential investment opportunities.
Business Model
We sell products and services that generate revenue in three major categories:
Licensed-based: The majority of our research, data, and proprietary platforms are accessed via subscriptions or contract-based licensing arrangements that grant access on either a per user or enterprise-basis for a specified period of time. Licensed-based revenue includes Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Office, PitchBook Data, Premium Memberships on Morningstar.com, and other similar products. Licensed-based revenue represented 73.7% of our 2018 consolidated revenue compared to 73.2% in 2017 and 72.6% in 2016.
Asset-based: We charge basis points and other fees for assets under management or advisement. Our Morningstar Investment Management, Workplace Solutions, and Morningstar Indexes products all fall under asset-based revenue. Asset-based revenue represented 19.6% of our 2018 consolidated revenue compared to 20.0% in 2017 and 20.5% in 2016.
10

Transaction-based: Ad sales on Morningstar.com and our Credit Ratings products comprise the majority of the products that are transactional, or one-time, in nature, versus the recurring revenue streams represented by our licensed and asset-based products. Transaction-based revenue represented 6.7% of our 2018 consolidated revenue compared to 6.8% in 2017 and 7.0% in 2016.
Major Products and Services
The section below describes our top five products by 2018 revenue and some of our other key products and services.
Morningstar Data
Morningstar Data gives institutions access to a full range of investment data spanning numerous investment databases, including equity fundamentals, managed investments, and real-time pricing and market data. We offer licenses and data feeds for our proprietary statistics, such as the Morningstar Style Box and Morningstar Rating, and a wide range of other data, including information on investment performance, risk, portfolios, operations data, fees and expenses, cash flows, financial statement data, consolidated industry statistics, and investment ownership. Institutions use Morningstar Data in a variety of investor communications, including websites, print publications, and marketing fact sheets, as well as for internal research and product development.
The Morningstar Data team pursues emerging technologies including robotics process automation (RPA), machine learning, and natural language processing to further automate the remaining manual, nonstructured, and complex data acquisition processes that traditional technologies are not able to address. This automation initiative has gained traction with the creation of machine learning models that reduce the time and effort to collect data, thus creating additional capacity to acquire new data sets. We’ve also made considerable progress in developing a scalable, easy-to-use global data delivery system that allows our users to define how they want to access information in a manner that works best for their application. This includes delivery of investment data via flat files, but future enhancements will offer a robust application programming interface (API) to access data and the ability for us to stream data directly to our clients. 
In 2018, our data expansion efforts led to the addition of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) intentionality attributes, strategic beta attributes, clean shares (service fee arrangements), revenue by region (geo-segment data) analytics, and economic exposure analytics. In Europe, we collected and delivered new regulatory data sets including Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) in Europe, Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs) in Europe, and the German Investment Tax Act in Germany. In Asia-Pacific, we expanded our Chinese fund sales suitability data and added a data set for annual report financials of Japanese-domiciled funds, including attributes such as interest income, profit and loss on the buying and selling of securities, futures capital gains, net income, stock futures ratio, and bond futures ratio. We also continued to invest in and expand our equity data sets, including daily total shares outstanding for higher-quality calculation of market capitalization and free float; the collection of CEO pay, median pay, and the ratio between them for U.S. companies; and normalized profitability metrics, bank reserve requirements, debt maturity schedules, and other industry metrics for the largest 8,000 companies. We also launched four fixed-income data-feed packages, including interest rate risk, return analytics, exposure analytics, and credit risk analytics, which surface more than 35 new data points.
Pricing for Morningstar Data is based on the number of investment vehicles covered, the amount of information provided for each security, the frequency of updates, the method of delivery, the size of the licensing firm, the level of distribution, and the specific intention for a client’s use of Morningstar Data, otherwise known as the “use-case.” 
Our main competitors for mutual fund data include Financial Express and Thomson Reuters on a global basis, as well as smaller players that focus on local or regional information. For market and equity data, we primarily compete with FactSet, Financial Express, Interactive Data, and Thomson Reuters. 
Morningstar Data is our largest product based on revenue and accounted for 18.2%, 18.2%, and 19.4% of our consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
11

Morningstar Direct
Morningstar Direct is an investment-analysis platform built for asset management and financial services professionals that includes data and advanced analytical tools on the complete range of securities in Morningstar's global database, as well as privately held investments and data from third-party providers. It helps portfolio managers, investment consultants, financial product managers, wealth managers, and other financial professionals develop, select, and monitor investments. Users can create advanced performance comparisons and in-depth analyses of an investment's underlying investment style, as well as custom-branded reports and presentations.
In 2018, we launched Morningstar Direct for Asset Management and Morningstar Direct for Wealth Management. These next-generation editions of Morningstar Direct all share the common, web-based Morningstar Cloud platform, allowing us to deliver workflow-specific functionality, more frequent upgrades, and continuous client support in a more efficient manner than the desktop-based Direct product. We also launched our new Investor Pulse business intelligence application, which allows users to explore flows data to pinpoint investor trends and predict future outcomes. This feature is exclusively available on the web-based editions of Morningstar Direct. 
In 2018, we released dozens of new ESG data points for clients to analyze in the web-based editions of Morningstar Direct, including our new Carbon Score, which assesses a portfolio’s overall carbon risk. Clients can also view and stress test aggregate sustainability scores of a specific portfolio. For a more accurate picture of fund holdings, our new Economic Exposure view in the web-based editions of Morningstar Direct reveals the underlying asset value of certain derivatives contracts rather than the value of the contracts themselves. We also developed a proprietary methodology that shows the geographic location of a portfolio’s revenue exposure, measured by where its underlying companies actually receive the revenue.
Morningstar Direct's primary competitors are Bloomberg, eVestment Alliance, FactSet Research System’s Cognity and SPAR, Strategic Insight’s Simfund, and Thomson Reuters’ Eikon.
Morningstar Direct had 15,033 licensed users worldwide as of December 31, 2018.
Pricing for Direct is based on the number of licenses purchased. Add-on features, like the advanced Global Risk Model, may incur additional fees.
Morningstar Direct is our second-largest product based on revenue and accounted for 13.5%, 13.6%, and 13.8% of our consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
12

Morningstar Investment Management
Morningstar Investment Management’s flagship offering is Morningstar Managed Portfolios, an advisor service consisting of model portfolios designed mainly for fee-based independent financial advisors. Morningstar Managed Portfolios are primarily multi-asset strategies built using mutual funds, ETFs, and individual securities, and are tailored to meet specific investment time horizons, risk levels, and projected outcomes to help investors reach their financial goals. 
Morningstar Managed Portfolios are available through two channels: our fee-based discretionary asset management service, also known as a turnkey asset management program (TAMP), or as strategist models on third-party managed account platforms. To date, our TAMP is available only in the U.S., whereas we strictly act as a model provider in our international markets. 
Our TAMP is an end-to-end fee-based advisory experience, in which advisors access our model portfolios through a proprietary technology platform that offers functionality such as proposals, client reporting, customer service, and back-office features such as trading. Using our TAMP allows the advisor to share fiduciary responsibility with us. 
Morningstar Managed Portfolios are also offered on third-party platforms in both the U.S. and our international markets. When acting solely as a model provider, we do not provide any of the functionality that is provided by our TAMP, nor do we have an advisory relationship with the advisor’s end client. 
In 2018, we launched Morningstar Funds Trust (Trust), a series of nine open-end, multimanager mutual funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.The Morningstar Funds--available exclusively through the U.S. version of the Morningstar Managed Portfolios service--were designed to replace third-party mutual funds used in our managed portfolios. As of December 31, 2018, we have converted approximately $1 billion of existing client assets into model portfolios that use the Morningstar Funds, and given advisor demand for high-quality, cost-effective, outsourced investment management, we expect demand for our portfolios that use Morningstar Funds to grow in 2019 and beyond.
We charge asset-based program fees for Morningstar Managed Portfolios, which are typically based on the type of service (i.e., TAMP versus strategist models) and the products contained within the portfolios.
In addition to Morningstar Managed Portfolios, other services we provide include institutional asset management (e.g., act as a subadvisor) and asset allocation services for asset managers, broker/dealers, and insurance providers. We offer these services through a variety of registered entities in Australia, Canada, UAE, France, Hong Kong, India, Japan, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. 
We base pricing for institutional asset management and asset allocation services on the scope of work, our degree of investment discretion, and the level of service required. In the majority of our contracts, we receive asset-based fees.
For Morningstar Managed Portfolios offered through our TAMP, our primary competitors are AssetMark, Brinker Capital, and SEI Investments. Our primary strategist offering competitors are Blackrock, Envestnet PMC, Russell, and Vanguard in the U.S., and we face competition from Financial Express and Seven in EMEA, and Dimensional, Russell, and Vanguard in Australia. We also compete with in-house research teams at independent broker/dealers who build proprietary portfolios for use on brokerage firm platforms, as well other registered investment advisors that provide investment strategies or models on these platforms. 
Morningstar Investment Management is our third-largest product based on revenue and made up 10.9%, 11.1%, and 11.5% of our consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
13

PitchBook Data
PitchBook Data, Inc., which we acquired in December 2016, provides data and research covering the private capital markets, including venture capital, private equity, and mergers and acquisitions (M&A). PitchBook's main product is the PitchBook Platform, an all-in-one research and analysis workstation for sophisticated investment and research professionals, including venture capital and private equity firms, corporate development teams, investment banks, limited partners, lenders, law firms, and accounting firms. Close to 23,000 professionals use this software to source deals, raise funds, build buyer lists, create benchmarks, network, and more. To accommodate their diverse needs, the platform offers advanced search functionality, a fully customizable dashboard and email alerts that help users discover and monitor relevant information.
PitchBook also offers a mobile application, Excel plug-in, data feeds, and flexible, à la carte data solutions that allow clients to access a variety of data points on demand.
In 2018, we delivered over 300 upgrade releases through the PitchBook Platform, making it easier and faster to derive meaningful insights into the evolving capital markets. We also focused on expanding datasets, adding coverage of over 320,000 new private middle market companies and also substantially increasing the number of financial statements available for more than 70,000 European private companies already covered. We also built new advanced search functionality for private debt and lenders, a dataset that makes up a substantial portion of the private capital markets but has been historically difficult to research. Over the past year, we increased the number of lenders we cover to 8,800 firms from 3,100 firms. We also integrated thematic and company-specific public equity research from Morningstar alongside PitchBook's own extensive private equity, venture capital, and M&A research. Our redesigned Research Center provides analysis spanning the public and private market continuum and offers greater transparency into the calculation methodologies behind key figures reported in public company financials, such as EBITDA and enterprise value.
PitchBook's main competitors are CB Insights, Dow Jones VentureSource, Prequin, S&P Capital IQ, and Thomson Reuters.
Pricing for the PitchBook Platform is based on the number of seats, with the standard base license fees per user, with customized prices for large enterprises, boutiques, and startup firms.
PitchBook is our fourth-largest product based on revenue and made up 9.8% of our consolidated revenue in 2018, compared with 7.0% in 2017. 
Morningstar Advisor Workstation
Morningstar Advisor Workstation is a web-based portfolio management system that combines Morningstar’s data, research, and analytics with best-in-class proposal and presentation generation tools. The software is typically sold through an enterprise contract and is primarily for retail advisors and home-office advisors due to its strong ties and integrations with home-office systems and processes and a library of FINRA-reviewed reports for compliance purposes. It allows advisors to build and maintain a client portfolio database that can be fully integrated with the home-office firm's back-office technology and resources. Moreover, it helps advisors present and clearly illustrate their portfolio investment strategies through an easy-to-understand reporting output. 
In 2018, we continued to enhance integrations with several leading third-party platforms, including Skience from Athene Group, MoneyGuidePro, eMoney, Redtail, and Albridge, to help advisors import client data into all aspects of their daily workflows. 
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 170 companies held licenses for the enterprise version of Morningstar Advisor Workstation, which accounts for approximately 185,000 users globally. Pricing for Morningstar Advisor Workstation varies based on the number of users, as well as the number of databases licensed and level of functionality. We charge fixed annual fees per licensed user for a base configuration of Morningstar Advisor Workstation, but pricing varies significantly based on the scope of the license. 
Competitors for Morningstar Advisor Workstation include AdvisoryWorld (LPL Financial), YCharts, ASI, Kwanti, and Financial Express outside of the U.S. Occasionally, broker/dealers also decide to build their own internal tools and attempt to bring their advisors’ practice management tools in-house.
14

Morningstar Advisor Workstation is our fifth-largest product based on revenue and made up 8.8%, 9.6%, and 10.3% of our consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Morningstar Office
Morningstar Office is a portfolio and practice management software package for independent registered investment advisors (RIAs) that combines portfolio accounting and reporting with Morningstar’s data, analytics, and research. 
In 2018, Morningstar Office Cloud, our next-generation web-based product for advisors, joined the web-based editions of Morningstar Direct on the Morningstar Cloud platform. Morningstar Office Cloud product enhancements include upgrades to Presentation Studio, which include a custom reporting solution, improvements to practice billing capabilities, user-defined security reclassifications, and a personal finance management component. 
Primary competitors to Morningstar Office Cloud include Black Diamond, Envestnet’s Tamarac, Orion Advisor Services, and Advyzon.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 5,500 financial advisors in the U.S. and the United Kingdom were licensed to use Morningstar Office.
Workplace Solutions
Morningstar Workplace Solutions includes several different offerings, including managed retirement accounts (MRA), fiduciary services, Morningstar Lifetime Allocation Funds, and custom models.
Delivered primarily through the Morningstar Retirement Manager platform, our MRA program helps retirement plan participants define, track, and achieve their retirement goals. As part of this service, we deliver personalized recommendations for a target retirement income goal, a recommended contribution rate to help achieve that goal, a portfolio mix based on our Total Wealth methodology, and specific investment recommendations. We then manage the participant’s investment portfolio for them, assuming full discretionary control. We also offer Advisor Managed Accounts, a program that allows financial advisors to specify and assume fiduciary responsibility for the underlying portfolios that we use in our service. We do not hold assets in custody for the managed retirement accounts we provide.
Our main competitors in MRA are Financial Engines, Fidelity, and Guided Choice. Companies that provide automated investment advice to consumers, such as Betterment and Wealthfront, are also attempting to break into employer-sponsored retirement markets.

In our fiduciary services offering, we help plan sponsors build out an appropriate investment lineup for their participants while helping to mitigate their fiduciary risk. Morningstar Plan Advantage is an extension of our fiduciary services that includes a technology platform that enables advisors at broker/dealer firms to more easily offer fiduciary protection, provider pricing, and investment reporting services to their plan sponsor clients.
Our main competitors in fiduciary services are Mesirow and Wilshire Associates, but we are starting to see growing competition with Envestnet and smaller players such as Leafhouse Financial and Iron Financial. Broker/dealers are also looking to introduce their own fiduciary services in direct competition with recordkeepers.
With our custom models, we offer two different services. We work with retirement plan recordkeepers to design scalable solutions for their investment lineups, including target maturity models and risk-based models. We also provide custom model services direct to large plan sponsors, creating target date funds that are customized around a plan’s participant demographics and investment menus. For custom models, we often compete with retirement plan consultants. We also serve as a nondiscretionary subadvisor and index provider for the Morningstar Lifetime Allocation Funds, a series of target-date collective investment trust funds (CITs) offered by UBS Asset Management to retirement plan sponsors. Retirement plan sponsors can select a conservative, moderate, or growth version of the glide path for the funds based on the needs of participants in the plan. For the Lifetime Allocation Funds, we compete with other providers of target-date funds.
In 2018, we signed our first large wealth management firm onto Morningstar Plan Advantage. 
Pricing for Workplace Solutions depends on several different factors, including the level of services offered (including whether the services involve acting as a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA), the number of participants, the level of systems integration required, and the availability of competing products. 
Morningstar.com
Our largest website, Morningstar.com, helps individual investors discover, evaluate, and monitor stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds; build and monitor portfolios; and monitor the markets. Revenue is generated from paid memberships through Morningstar Premium and Internet advertising sales.
Our Morningstar Premium offering is focused on bringing clarity and confidence to investment decisions. Members have access to proprietary Morningstar research, ratings, data, and tools, including analyst reports, portfolio management tools (such as Portfolio X-Ray), and stock and fund screeners.
16

We currently offer Premium Membership services in Australia, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.
While many consumer-facing websites purchase advertising programmatically, Morningstar.com owns and sells digital advertising on a direct basis. In our experience, advertisers that desire to reach our significant user base of engaged individual investors support Morningstar.com’s value as a unique, high-quality web property.
In 2018, we successfully migrated all of our Premium membership to the newly redesigned Morningstar.com. The new Morningstar.com features streamlined navigation, a new quote page with an enhanced Analyst Report interface, and a Best Investment Center that prescreens our favorite stock, ETF, and mutual fund ideas.
Morningstar.com primarily competes with trading platforms that concurrently offer research and investing advice, such as Fidelity, Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and eTrade. Research sites, such as The Motley Fool, Seeking Alpha, and Zacks Investment Research, also compete with us for paid membership. In addition, free or “freemium” websites such as Yahoo Finance, Dow Jones/Marketwatch, The Wall Street Journal, Kiplinger, and TheStreet.com all compete for the advertising dollars of entities wishing to reach an engaged audience of investors. 
As of December 31, 2018, Morningstar.com had approximately 10 million registered free members worldwide. We also had approximately 116,000 paid Premium members in the U.S. plus an additional 15,000 Premium members across other global markets. We charge a monthly, annual, or multi-year subscription fee for Morningstar.com's Premium Membership service.
The graph below shows our annual retention rates for subscription-based products, which are primarily Morningstar.com's Premium Membership service and newsletter products. In 2018, we estimate that our annual retention rate for subscription-based products was approximately 68%, compared to 66% in 2017.

Morningstar Credit Ratings
Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC is an NRSRO that provides timely new issue and surveillance ratings for structured finance transactions, as well as corporate issuers and financial institutions and their individual debt issuances. We provide ratings on a broad range of structured finance securities, including commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), single-family rental securities, collateralized loan obligations, and other asset-backed securities (ABS). We also provide other (non-credit rating) services such as CMBS deal monitoring, corporate credit estimates, and operational risk assessment services.
In 2018, we invested heavily in our CMBS rating business, introducing a new methodology for rating CMBS single asset/single borrower (SASB) transactions, and updating our existing methodology for rating CMBS conduit transactions. We also provided RMBS and ABS market participants with cutting edge thought leadership throughout the year.
Our business competes with several other firms, including DBRS, Fitch, Kroll Bond Ratings, Moody’s, and S&P Global Ratings.
For new-issue ratings, we charge one-time fees to the issuer based on the type of security, the size of the transaction, and the complexity of the issue. Our rating fees also can cover surveillance of the transaction until the securities mature. We charge annual fees for our subscription-based CMBS monitoring service. Pricing for this service varies depending on the solution and the level of access within a client organization.
Morningstar Indexes
We offer a broad range of indexes that can be used as performance benchmarks and for the purposes of creating investment products. Our indexes track major asset classes, including global equity, global fixed income and commodities. We offer multi-asset indexes, strategic beta indexes based on Morningstar’s proprietary research, and sustainability indexes.
In 2018, several global asset managers launched low-cost investment vehicles tracking Morningstar’s beta indexes. In addition, products based on our factor-based indexes, which included dividend-based indexes and moat-focused indexes that draw upon our proprietary research launched in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. We launched additional sustainability-focused index families, including Low Carbon Risk, Sustainable Environment, and Sustainability Leaders.
More than 100 firms have now joined the Morningstar Open Indexes Project, which allows asset managers and other firms the ability to benchmark their investments against more than 100 Morningstar global equity indexes for free. The goal of the project is to lower benchmarking costs for the industry and improve outcomes for investors in response to the escalating costs of licensing market-cap-weighted equity indexes. Participants receive price return, total return, net return, and month-end constituent data for indexes included in the project. 
We license Morningstar Indexes to numerous institutions that offer ETFs, exchange-traded notes, and structured products based on the indexes. Firms license Morningstar Indexes for both product creation (where we typically receive the greater of a minimum fee or basis points tied to assets under management) and data licensing (where we typically receive annual licensing fees). In both cases, our pricing varies based on the level of distribution, the type of user, and the specific indexes licensed.
Major competitors for Morningstar Indexes include FTSE Russell, MSCI, S&P Dow Jones Indices (offered through S&P Global), and Bloomberg Indices.
Largest Customer
In 2018, our largest customer accounted for less than 2% of our consolidated revenue.

Acquisitions and Divestitures
Since our founding in 1984, we've supported our organic growth by introducing new products and services and expanding our existing offerings. From 2006 through 2018, we also completed 31 acquisitions to support our growth objectives. We did not make any significant acquisitions in 2018. We divested our 15(c) board consulting services product line in the first quarter of 2018.
For more information about our acquisitions and divestitures, refer to Notes 8 and 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
International Operations
We conduct our business operations outside of the U.S. through wholly owned or majority-owned operating subsidiaries based in each of the following 26 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, People's Republic of China (both Hong Kong and the mainland), Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. See Note 6 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning revenue from customers and long-lived assets from our business operations outside the U.S.
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
We treat our brand name and logo, product names, databases and related content, software, technology, know-how, and the like as proprietary. We seek to protect this intellectual property by using: (i) trademark, copyright, patent and trade secrets laws; (ii) licensing and nondisclosure agreements; and (iii) other security and related technical measures designed to restrict unauthorized access and use. For example, we generally provide our intellectual property to third parties through the use of standard licensing agreements, which define the extent and duration of any third-party usage rights and provide for our continued ownership in any intellectual property furnished.
Because of the value of our brand name and logo, we generally seek to register one or both of them as trademarks in all relevant international classes in any jurisdiction in which we have business offices or significant operations. We have registered the Morningstar name and/or logo in approximately 50 jurisdictions, including the European Union, and have registrations pending in several others. In some jurisdictions, we may also choose to register one or more product names. 
“Morningstar” and the Morningstar logo are both registered marks of Morningstar in the U.S. The table below includes some of the trademarks and service marks referenced in this report:

Morningstar® Advisor WorkstationSM | Morningstar® Plan AdvantageSM 
Morningstar Analyst RatingTM | Morningstar® Portfolio X-Ray® 
Morningstar® ByAllAccounts® | Morningstar Rating™ 
Morningstar® Data | Morningstar® Retirement ManagerSM 
Morningstar DirectSM | Morningstar Style Box™ 
Morningstar® Enterprise Components | Morningstar Sustainability Rating™
Morningstar® Indexes | Morningstar.com® 
Morningstar® Managed PortfoliosSM | PitchBook® 
Morningstar Market BarometerSM | 
Morningstar OfficeSM | 

In addition to trademark registrations, we hold several patents in the U.S., including a patent for a coordinate-based document processing system and several patents held by our wholly owned subsidiary, Morningstar Investment Management LLC, for lifetime asset allocation and asset allocation with annuities.

License Agreements
We license our products and related intellectual property to our customers, generally for a fee. Generally, we use our standard agreement forms, and we do not provide our products and services to customers or other users without having an agreement in place.
We maintain licensing agreements with most of our larger Morningstar operating companies around the world to allow them to access and use our intellectual property, including, without limitation, our products, trademarks, databases and content, technology, and know-how. We put these agreements in place to allow our operating companies to both market standard Morningstar products and services in their operating territories and to develop and sell territory-specific variants of those products under the Morningstar name in their specific territories.
In the ordinary course of our business, we obtain and use intellectual property from a variety of sources, including licensing it from third-party providers, developing it internally, and gathering it through publicly available sources (e.g., regulatory filings).
Seasonality
We believe our business has a minimal amount of seasonality. Some of our smaller products, such as our annual investment conference in Chicago, generate the majority of their revenue in the first or second quarter of the year. We sell most of our products with subscription or license terms of at least one year and we recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription or license agreement. This tends to offset most of the seasonality in our business. 
We believe market movements generally have more influence on our performance than seasonality. The revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
Competitive Landscape
The economic and financial information industry includes a few large firms as well as numerous smaller companies, including startup firms. Some of our main competitors include Bloomberg, S&P Global, and Thomson Reuters. These companies have financial resources that are significantly greater than ours. We also compete with a variety of other companies in specific areas of our business. We discuss some of the key competitors in each area in the Major Products and Services section of this report. 
We believe the most important competitive factors in our industry are brand and reputation, data accuracy and quality, technology, breadth of data coverage, quality of investment research and analytics, design, product reliability, and value of the products and services provided.
Research and Development
A key aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our investment research capabilities and enhance our existing products and services. We strive to adopt new technology that can improve our products and services. As a general practice, we manage our own websites and build our own software rather than relying on outside vendors. This allows us to control our technology development and better manage costs, enabling us to respond quickly to market changes and to meet customer needs efficiently. As of December 31, 2018, our technology team consisted of approximately 1,400 programmers and technology and infrastructure professionals. 
Government Regulation

In addition, in cases where these subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to retirement plans and their participants, they may be acting as fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). As fiduciaries under ERISA, they have duties of loyalty and prudence, as well as duties to diversify investments and to follow plan documents to comply with the applicable portions of ERISA.
Morningstar Investment Services LLC is a broker/dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and a member of FINRA. The regulation of broker/dealers has, to a large extent, been delegated by the federal securities laws to self-regulatory organizations, including FINRA. Subject to approval by the SEC, FINRA adopts rules that govern its members. FINRA and the SEC conduct periodic examinations of the brokerage operations of Morningstar Investment Services. 
Broker/dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales, capital structure, record-keeping, and the conduct of directors, officers, and employees.

21

United Kingdom
Morningstar Investment Management Europe Ltd. is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to provide advisory services in the United Kingdom. As an authorized firm, Morningstar Investment Management Europe Ltd. is subject to the requirements and regulations of the FCA. Such requirements relate to, among other things, financial reporting and other reporting obligations, record-keeping, and cross-border requirements.
In addition, our index business, as a non-European Union administrator of indexes, will be seeking recognition from the FCA under EU benchmark regulations so that our indexes can continue to be used by EU sponsors or investable products (e.g., ETFs). Morningstar Investment Management Europe Ltd. will act as our legal representative for this purpose in the EU. Compliance with these regulations will require us to, among other things, comply with the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks and related certification requirements.
Other Regions
We have a variety of other entities (including in Canada, France, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, and South Africa) that are registered with their respective regulatory bodies; however, the amount of business conducted by these entities related to the registration is relatively small.
Additional legislation and regulations--including those not directly tied to investment advisory activities (e.g. privacy and cybersecurity) as well as changes in rules imposed by the SEC or other U.S. or non-U.S. regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations--or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may adversely affect our business and profitability. 
Employees
We had 5,416 employees globally as of December 31, 2018. Our U.S.-based employees are not represented by any unions, and we have never experienced a walkout or strike.
