Item 1. Business
Overview
Wynn Resorts, Limited ("Wynn Resorts," or together with its subsidiaries, "we" or the "Company") is a leading developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts (integrated resorts) that integrate hotel accommodations and a wide range of amenities, including fine dining outlets, premium retail offerings, distinctive entertainment theaters and large meeting complexes. 
We currently own approximately 72% of Wynn Macau, Limited ("WML") and operate two integrated resorts in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China ("Macau"), Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau (collectively, our "Macau Operations"). In Las Vegas, Nevada, we operate and, with the exception of certain retail space, own 100% of Wynn Las Vegas, which we also refer to as our Las Vegas Operations. We are also currently constructing Encore Boston Harbor, an integrated resort in Everett, Massachusetts, adjacent to Boston, which we expect to open in mid-2019.
We present the operating results of our three resorts in the following segments: Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau, and Las Vegas Operations. 
Wynn Resorts, a Nevada corporation, was formed in 2002. Wynn Resorts files annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments of such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

Our Resorts
Macau Operations
We opened Wynn Macau on September 6, 2006, Encore, an expansion of Wynn Macau, on April 21, 2010, and Wynn Palace on August 22, 2016.

Wynn Las Vegas is located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, and occupies approximately 215 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip. In addition, we own approximately 18 acres across Sands Avenue, a portion of which is utilized for employee parking and an office building, and approximately five acres adjacent to the golf course land upon which an office building is located. 
Wynn Las Vegas features the following as of February 20, 2019: 

• | Approximately 192,000 square feet of casino space, offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games with 243 table games and 1,811 slot machines, private gaming salons, a sky casino, a poker room, and a race and sports book;

("Crown") to own and operate approximately 88,000 square feet of existing retail space. In November 2017, we contributed approximately 74,000 square feet of additional retail space to the Retail Joint Venture, which opened in November 2018. For more information on the Retail Joint Venture, see Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 14, "Retail Joint Venture."
In response to our evaluation of our Las Vegas Operations and our commitment to creating a unique customer experience, we have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to this resort. 

Construction and Development Opportunities
We are currently constructing Encore Boston Harbor, an integrated resort in Everett, Massachusetts, adjacent to Boston along the Mystic River. The resort will contain a hotel, a waterfront boardwalk, meeting and convention space, casino space, a spa, retail offerings and food and beverage outlets. The total project budget, including gaming license fees, construction costs, capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses and land costs, is estimated to be approximately $2.6 billion. As of December 31, 2018, we have incurred approximately $2.03 billion in total project costs. We expect to open Encore Boston Harbor in mid-2019. 
We are currently constructing approximately 430,000 square feet of additional meeting and convention space at Wynn Las Vegas and have begun design and site preparation for the reconfiguration of the Wynn Las Vegas golf course, which we closed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Based on current designs, we estimate the total project budget to be approximately $425 million. We 
4
expect to reopen the golf course in the fourth quarter of 2019 and open the additional meeting and convention space in the first quarter of 2020.
We have begun a reconfiguration of the current Wynn Club gaming area at Wynn Macau. When completed, the enhanced space will consist of approximately 40 mass market table games, a refurbished high-limit slot area, two new restaurants and approximately 7,400 square feet of retail space, and will provide for improved pedestrian access. We estimate the total project budget to be approximately $62 million. We expect to complete the gaming enhancements and open the new restaurants in the third quarter of 2019, and we expect to open the new retail space at the end of 2019.
We are exploring various development opportunities with respect to the approximately 38 acres of land located on the Las Vegas Strip directly across from Wynn Las Vegas.    
We continually seek out new opportunities for additional gaming or related businesses, in the United States, and worldwide.
Our Strategy
We believe that Wynn Resorts is the world's preeminent designer, developer, and operator of integrated resorts. The Company's integrated resort business model integrates luxury hotel rooms, high-end retail, an array of dining and entertainment options, meeting and convention space, and gaming, all supported by superior levels of customer service. We believe that our resorts and management continue to benefit from our extensive design and operational experience across numerous gaming jurisdictions, providing a distinct advantage over other gaming enterprises. 
Wynn Resorts and its experienced management team have a demonstrated track record in developing and operating successful integrated resort projects around the world. In addition, we have a design, development and construction subsidiary, in which senior management has significant experience across all major construction disciplines.
We aim to build appropriately scaled integrated resorts that attract a wide range of customer segments (including premium international customers) and generate strong financial results. We design and continually refresh our integrated resorts to create unique customer experiences across a wide range of gaming and non-gaming amenities. Our business is dependent upon repeat visitation from our guests. We believe superior customer experience and service is the best marketing strategy to attract and retain our customers. Human resources and staff training are essential to our strategy to ensure our employees are prepared to provide the luxury service that our guests expect. 
Our integrated resorts are conceptualized, designed, built and operated in major metropolitan markets to service all customers with an emphasis on providing superior levels of premium customer service. In Las Vegas and Macau, we have been successful in attracting not only a wide range of domestic guests, but also extending our customer market areas into international markets. We leverage our international marketing team across branch offices located in Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Canada to attract international customers. 
Reflecting our commitment to customer service globally, the Company has received the following recognition:

• | Collectively, Wynn Resorts earned more Five-Star awards than any other independent hotel company in the world in the official 2019 Forbes Travel Guide Star Rating list.


• | Wynn Palace garnered six individual Five-Star awards in the 2019 Forbes Travel Guide Star Rating list.


• | In 2019, Wynn Macau continues to be the only resort in the world with eight individual Forbes Five-Star awards.


• | With fourteen Forbes Five-Star awards combined, Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace are the most decorated integrated resort brands in Asia.


• | Wynn Resorts owns two of the largest Forbes Five-Star hotels in the United States: Wynn Tower Suites (Las Vegas) and Encore Tower Suites (Las Vegas).


• | Wynn Resorts was once again honored as the highest ranking casino resort on FORTUNE Magazine's 2019 World's Most Admired Companies list in the hotel, casino and resort category.

5
We plan to continue to seek out new opportunities to develop and operate integrated resorts, including related businesses, around the world. Overall, we believe Wynn Resorts has a demonstrated track record of developing integrated resorts that stimulate city- and region-wide economic activity, which we believe includes:

• | attracting a wide range of customers to the region, including high-net-worth international tourists;


• | driving international tourism for the region;


• | raising average hotel room rates in the region;


• | extending the average length of stay per visitor;


• | complementing existing convention and meeting business with five-star accommodations and appropriately scaled meeting amenities;


• | elevating service levels with the execution of five-star customer service; and


• | helping stimulate city-wide investment and employment.

Market and Competition
The casino resort industry is highly competitive. Both our Macau Operations and Las Vegas Operations compete with other high-quality casino resorts. Resorts located near our properties compete on the basis of the range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment, themes and size, among other factors. We seek to differentiate our Macau and Las Vegas integrated resorts from other major resorts by delivering superior design and customer service. 
Macau
Macau is governed as a special administrative region of China and is located approximately 37 miles southwest of Hong Kong. The journey between Macau and Hong Kong takes approximately 15 minutes by helicopter, 30 minutes by road since the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge in October 2018 and one hour by jetfoil ferry. Macau, which has been a casino destination for more than 50 years, consists principally of a peninsula on mainland China and two neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane, between which the Cotai area is located. In 2002, the government of Macau ended a 40-year monopoly on the conduct of gaming operations by conducting a competitive process that resulted in the issuance of gaming concessions to three concessionaires (including Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A., ("Wynn Macau SA")) who in turn were permitted, subject to the approval of the government of Macau, to each grant one subconcession, resulting in a total of six gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires. In addition to Wynn Macau SA, each of Sociedade de Jogos de Macau ("SJM") and Galaxy Entertainment Group Limited ("Galaxy") are primary concessionaires with Sands China Ltd. ("Sands"), Melco International Development Limited ("Melco") and MGM China Holdings Limited ("MGM China") operating under subconcessions. There is no limit to the number of casinos each concessionaire or subconcessionaire is permitted to operate, but each facility is subject to government approval. Currently, there are 41 casinos operating in Macau.
We believe that the Macau region hosts one of the world's largest concentrations of potential gaming customers. Since the introduction of new casinos starting in 2004, the Macau market has experienced a significant increase in annual gaming revenue and has become the largest gaming market in the world. According to Macau Statistical Information, annual gaming revenues have grown from $2.9 billion in 2002 to $37.5 billion in 2018. 
Macau's gaming market is primarily dependent on tourists. Gaming customers traveling to Macau typically come from nearby destinations in Asia. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, approximately 90% of the visitors to Macau in 2018 came from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Travel to Macau by citizens of mainland China requires a visa. 
According to 2018 government statistics, Macau tourist arrivals increased 9.8%, to 35.8 million, from 32.6 million in 2017. The increase in tourist arrivals contributed to a 13.3% increase in annual gaming revenues to $37.5 billion in 2018, from $33.1 billion in 2017.
The Macau market has experienced tremendous growth in capacity since the opening of Wynn Macau in 2006. As of December 31, 2018, there were 38,800 hotel rooms, 6,588 table games and 16,059 slot machines in Macau, compared to 12,978 hotel rooms, 2,762 table games and 6,546 slot machines as of December 31, 2006. During 2016, we contributed to the new capacity in the market with the opening of Wynn Palace in the Cotai area. Several of the current concessionaires and subconcessionaires 
6
also opened additional facilities from 2016 through 2018 in the Cotai area and will open additional facilities over the next few years, which will further increase other gaming and non-gaming offerings in the Macau market. 
Our Macau Operations face competition primarily from the 39 other casinos located throughout Macau in addition to casinos located throughout the world, including Singapore, South Korea, the Philippines, Malaysia, Australia, Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia. Additionally, certain other Asian countries have legalized or in the future may legalize gaming, such as Japan, Taiwan and Thailand, which could increase competition for our Macau Operations.
Las Vegas
Las Vegas is the largest gaming market in the United States. During 2018, the economic environment in the gaming and hotel markets improved in Las Vegas. Las Vegas Strip gaming revenues increased to $6.6 billion from $6.5 billion in 2017. Overall Las Vegas visitor volume was 42.1 million in 2018. Passenger traffic at McCarran International Airport increased 2.5% in 2018, following year-over-year increases of 5.8%, 4.5%, and 2.2% from 2015 to 2017, respectively. During 2018, the average daily room rate and revenue per available room on the Las Vegas Strip increased 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Occupancy on the Las Vegas Strip slightly decreased 0.5% to 89.5%, from 90.0% in 2017. Convention attendees decreased 2.2% in 2018, following year-over-year increases of 5.3%, 7.1%, and 13.4% from 2015 to 2017, respectively. 
Wynn Las Vegas is located on the Las Vegas Strip and competes with other high-quality resorts and hotel casinos in Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas also competes, to some extent, with other casino resorts throughout the United States and elsewhere in the world.
Regulation and Licensing
Macau
As a casino concessionaire, Wynn Macau SA is subject to the regulatory control of the government of Macau. The government has adopted Laws and Administrative Regulations governing the operation of casinos in Macau. Only concessionaires or subconcessionaires are permitted to operate casinos. Subconcessions may be awarded subject to the approval of the Macau government and each concessionaire has issued one subconcession. Each concessionaire was required to enter into a concession agreement with the Macau government which, together with the Law and Administrative Regulations, form the framework for the regulation of the activities of the concessionaire.
Under the Law and Administrative Regulations, concessionaires are subject to suitability requirements relating to background, associations and reputation, as are stockholders of 5% or more of a concessionaire's equity securities, officers, directors and key employees. The same requirements apply to any entity engaged by a concessionaire to manage casino operations. Concessionaires are required to satisfy minimum capitalization requirements, demonstrate and maintain adequate financial capacity to operate the concession and submit to continuous monitoring of their casino operations by the Macau government. Concessionaires also are subject to periodic financial reporting requirements and reporting obligations with respect to, among other things, certain contracts, financing activities and transactions with directors, financiers and key employees. Transfers or the encumbering of interests in concessionaires must be reported to the Macau government and are ineffective without government approval.
Each concessionaire is required to engage an executive director who must be a permanent resident of Macau and the holder of at least 10% of the capital stock of the concessionaire. The appointment of the executive director and of any successor is ineffective without the approval of the Macau government. All contracts placing the management of a concessionaire's casino operations with a third party also are ineffective without the approval of the Macau government.
Concessionaires are subject to a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming revenue, and must also make an annual contribution of up to 4% of gross gaming revenue for the promotion of public interests, social security, infrastructure and tourism. Concessionaires are obligated to withhold applicable taxes, according to the rate in effect as set by the government, from any commissions paid to gaming promoters. The withholding rate may be adjusted from time to time.
The concession agreement between Wynn Macau SA and the Macau government required Wynn Macau SA to construct and operate one or more casino gaming properties in Macau, including, at a minimum, one full-service casino resort by the end of December 2006, and to invest not less than a total of 4 billion Macau patacas (approximately $500.0 million) in Macau-related projects by June 2009. These obligations were satisfied upon the opening of Wynn Macau in 2006.
7
Wynn Macau SA was also obligated to obtain, and did obtain, a 700.0 million Macau pataca (approximately $87.0 million) bank guarantee from Banco National Ultramarino, S.A. ("BNU") that was effective until March 31, 2007. The amount of this guarantee was reduced to 300 million Macau patacas (approximately $37.3 million) for the period from April 1, 2007 until 180 days after the end of the term of the concession agreement. This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures Wynn Macau SA's performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform the concession agreement. Wynn Macau SA is obligated, upon demand by BNU, to promptly repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. BNU is currently paid an annual fee by Wynn Macau SA for the guarantee of approximately 2.3 million patacas (approximately $0.3 million).
Effective June 24, 2017, the government of Macau may redeem the concession and in such event, Wynn Macau SA will be entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption multiplied by the remaining years before expiration of the concession.
The government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession if Wynn Macau SA fails to fulfill its fundamental obligations under the concession agreement. The concession agreement expressly provides that the government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession agreement if Wynn Macau SA:

• | conducts unauthorized games or activities that are excluded from its corporate purpose;


• | abandons or suspends gaming operations in Macau for more than seven consecutive days (or more than 14 days in a civil year) without justification;


• | defaults in payment of taxes, premiums, contributions or other required amounts;


• | does not comply with government inspections or supervision;


• | systematically fails to observe its obligations under the concession system;


• | fails to maintain bank guarantees or bonds satisfactory to the government;


• | is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or becomes insolvent;


• | engages in serious fraudulent activity, damaging to the public interest; or


• | repeatedly and seriously violates applicable gaming laws.

If the government of Macau unilaterally rescinds the concession agreement for one of the reasons stated above, Wynn Macau SA will be required to compensate the government in accordance with applicable law, and the areas defined as casino under Macau law and all of the gaming equipment pertaining to the gaming operations of Wynn Macau SA will be transferred to the government without compensation. In addition, the government of Macau may, in the public interest, unilaterally terminate the concession at any time, in which case Wynn Macau SA would be entitled to reasonable compensation.
The government of Macau may assume temporary custody and control over the operation of a concession in certain circumstances. During any such period, the costs of operations must be borne by the concessionaire. The government of Macau also may redeem a concession starting at an established date after the entering into effect of a concession.
The Macau government has publicly commented that it is studying the process by which gaming concessions and subconcessions may be extended, renewed or issued. The current term of our gaming concession ends on June 26, 2022. The gaming concession or subconcession held by each of Galaxy, Sands and Melco also end on June 26, 2022. The gaming concession or subconcession held by each of SJM and MGM China ends on March 31, 2020.
A gaming promoter, also known as a junket representative, is a person or entity who, for the purpose of promoting casino gaming activity, arranges customer transportation and accommodations, and provides credit in their sole discretion, food and beverage services and entertainment in exchange for commissions or other compensation from a concessionaire. Macau law provides that gaming promoters must be licensed by the Macau government in order to do business with and receive compensation from concessionaires. For a license to be obtained, direct and indirect owners of 5% or more of a gaming promoter (regardless of its corporate form or sole proprietor status), its directors and its key employees must be found suitable. Applicants are required to pay the cost of license investigations, and are required to maintain suitability standards during the period of licensure. The term of a gaming promoter's license is one calendar year, and licenses can be renewed for additional periods upon the submission of renewal applications. Natural person junket representative licensees are subject to a suitability verification process every three years and business entity licensees are subject to the same requirement every six years. Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (the "DICJ") implemented certain instructions in 2009, which have the force of law, relating to commissions paid to, and by, gaming promoters. Such instructions also impose certain financial reporting and audit requirements on gaming promoters.
8
Under Macau law, licensed gaming promoters must identify outside contractors who assist them in their promotion activities, and these contractors are subject to approval of the Macau government. Changes in the management structure of business entity gaming promoters' licensees must be reported to the Macau government and any transfer or the encumbering of interests in such licensees is ineffective without prior government approval. To conduct gaming promotion activities, licensees must be registered with one or more concessionaires and must have written contracts with such concessionaires, copies of which must be submitted to the Macau government.
Macau law further provides that concessionaires are jointly responsible with their gaming promoters for the gaming activities of such representatives and their directors and contractors in the concessionaire's casinos, and for their compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Concessionaires must submit annual lists of their gaming promoters, and must update such lists on a quarterly basis. The Macau government may designate a maximum number of gaming promoters and specify the number of gaming promoters a concessionaire is permitted to engage. Concessionaires are subject to periodic reporting requirements with respect to commissions paid to their gaming promoters' representatives and are required to oversee their activities and report instances of unlawful activity.
In late 2015, the Macau government implemented enhanced accounting and financial procedures and requirements to be followed by gaming promoters. These enhanced procedures require gaming promoters to disclose more detailed financial and accounting information to the DICJ, including the disclosure of certain financial information on a monthly basis. Gaming promoters also must identify and nominate senior financial or accounting representatives to be available to the DICJ for any follow-up matters the DICJ may require. Local Macau media has reported that the DICJ is finalizing its proposal for additional regulations and enhanced requirements on gaming promoters that may come into effect in 2019.
Nevada
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations made thereunder, as well as to various local ordinances. Our Las Vegas Operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission ("NGC"), the Nevada Gaming Control Board (“NGCB”) and the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board ("CCLGLB"). The NGC and NGCB are referred to herein collectively as the "Nevada Gaming Authorities."
The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy. Such public policy concerns include, among other things:

• | preventing unsavory or unsuitable persons from being directly or indirectly involved with gaming at any time or in any capacity;


• | establishing and maintaining responsible accounting practices and procedures;


• | maintaining effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and safeguarding assets and revenue, providing reliable recordkeeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;


• | preventing cheating and fraudulent practices; and


• | providing a source of state and local revenue through taxation and licensing fees.

Changes in applicable laws, regulations and procedures could have significant negative effects on our Las Vegas gaming operations and our financial condition and results of operations.
Our subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, the owner and operator of Wynn Las Vegas, is licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities to conduct casino gaming operations, including a race book and sports pool, pari-mutuel wagering and the operation of gaming salons. These gaming licenses are not transferable.
Wynn Resorts was found suitable by the NGC to own the equity interests of Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC ("Wynn Resorts Holdings"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, and to be registered by the NGC as a publicly traded corporation, referred to as a registered company, for the purposes of the Nevada Gaming Control Act. Wynn Resorts Holdings was found suitable by the NGC to own the equity interests of Wynn America, LLC ("Wynn America") and to be registered by the NGC as an intermediary company. Wynn America was found suitable by the NGC to own the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas Holdings, LLC and to be registered by the NGC as an intermediary company. Wynn Las Vegas Holdings, LLC was found suitable by the NGC to own the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and to be registered by the NGC as an intermediary company. 
9
Periodically, we are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the NGC and provide any other information that the NGC may require. Substantially all of our material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must be reported to, and/or approved by, the NGC.
No person may become a more than 5% stockholder or member of, or receive any percentage of the profits of, an intermediary company or company licensee without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material involvement with us to determine whether the individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming licensee. Certain of our officers, directors and key employees have been or may be required to file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and are or may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may require additional applications and may also deny an application for licensing for any reason which they deem appropriate. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. An applicant for licensing or an applicant for a finding of suitability must pay or must cause to be paid all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensing, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have the jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.
If the NGC determines that we or a licensed or registered subsidiary have violated the Nevada Gaming Control Act or any of its regulations, it could limit, condition, suspend or revoke our registrations and gaming license. In addition, we and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Gaming Control Act, or of the regulations of the NGC, at the discretion of the NGC. Further, the NGC could appoint a supervisor to operate our Las Vegas Operations and, under specified circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor's appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the premises) could be forfeited to the State of Nevada. The limitation, conditioning or suspension of any of our gaming licenses and the appointment of a supervisor could, and revocation of any gaming license would, have a significant negative effect on our gaming operations.
Any beneficial owner of Wynn Resorts' voting or nonvoting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated and have that person's suitability as a beneficial owner of voting securities determined if the NGC has reason to believe that the ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. If the beneficial owner of the voting or nonvoting securities of Wynn Resorts who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information, including a list of its beneficial owners. The applicant must pay all costs of the investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any investigation.
The Nevada Gaming Control Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of our voting securities to report the acquisition to the NGC. The Nevada Gaming Control Act requires beneficial owners of more than 10% of a registered company's voting securities to apply to the NGC for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Chairman of the NGCB mails the written notice requiring such filing. An “institutional investor” as defined in the Nevada Gaming Control Act which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 25%, of a registered company's voting securities may apply to the NGC for a waiver of a finding of suitability if the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may hold more than 25% but not more than 29% of a registered company's voting securities and maintain its waiver where the additional ownership results from a stock repurchase by the registered company. An institutional investor which beneficially owns more than 10% but not more than 11% of a registered company's voting securities as a result of a stock repurchase by the registered company may not be required to file such an application. An institutional investor will not be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the registered company, a change in the corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered company, or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which the NGC finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered company's voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities which are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include:

• | voting on all matters voted on by stockholders or interest holders;


• | making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in management, policies or operations; and


• | other activities that the NGC may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

The articles of incorporation of Wynn Resorts include provisions intended to assist its implementation of the above restrictions.
10
Wynn Resorts is required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada which may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make the disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are required to provide maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner of any of Wynn Resorts' voting securities. The NGC has the power to require the stock certificates of any registered company to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act. The certificates representing shares of Wynn Resorts' common stock note that the shares are subject to a right of redemption and other restrictions set forth in Wynn Resorts' articles of incorporation and bylaws and that the shares are, or may become, subject to restrictions imposed by applicable gaming laws.
Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the NGC or by the Chairman of the NGCB, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in connection with the investigation of its application may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of any voting security or debt security of a registered company beyond the period of time as may be prescribed by the NGC may be guilty of a criminal offense. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to hold an equity interest or to have any other relationship with us, we:

• | pay that person any dividend or interest upon any voting securities;


• | allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right held by that person relating to Wynn Resorts;


• | pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or


• | fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to relinquish such person's voting securities, including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of the voting securities for cash at fair market value.

If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the NGC may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability or questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicial review in Nevada.
The NGC may, in its discretion, require the owner of any debt or similar securities of a registered company, to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt or other securities of the registered company if the NGC has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. If the NGC decides that a person is unsuitable to own the securities, then under the Nevada Gaming Control Act, the registered company can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals if, without the prior approval of the NGC, it

• | pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or any distribution whatsoever;


• | recognizes any voting right by the unsuitable person in connection with the securities;


• | pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or


• | makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction.

 We may not make a public offering (debt or equity) without the prior approval of the NGC if the proceeds from the offering are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes or for similar transactions. On March 17, 2016, the NGC granted Wynn Resorts prior approval, subject to certain conditions, to make public offerings for a period of three years (the "Shelf Approval"). We have applied for a new Shelf Approval. The Shelf Approval may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chairman of the NGCB.
A registered company must obtain the prior approval of the NGC with respect to a change in control through merger; consolidation; stock or asset acquisitions; management or consulting agreements; or any act or conduct by a person by which the person obtains control of the registered company.
Entities seeking to acquire control of a registered company must satisfy the NGCB and NGC with respect to a variety of stringent standards before assuming control of the registered company. The NGC may also require controlling stockholders, officers, 
11
directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.
The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada corporate gaming licensees or affecting registered companies that are affiliated with the operations of Nevada gaming licensees may be harmful to stable and productive corporate gaming. The NGC has established a regulatory scheme to reduce the potential adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada's gaming industry and to further Nevada's policy in order to:

• | assure the financial stability of corporate gaming licensees and their affiliated companies;


• | preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and


• | promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

Approvals may be required from the NGC before a registered company can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above its current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Gaming Control Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a registered company's board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to its stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control.
License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the counties and cities in which the licensed subsidiaries' respective operations are conducted. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon a percentage of the gross revenue received; the number of gaming devices operated; or the number of table games operated. A live entertainment tax also is imposed on admission charges where live entertainment is furnished.
Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered in Nevada, or is under common control with such persons (collectively, "licensees"), and who proposes to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required to deposit with the NGCB, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation of the NGCB of the licensee's or registrant's participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the NGC. Licensees and registrants are required to comply with the foreign gaming reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Gaming Control Act. A licensee or registrant is also subject to disciplinary action by the NGC if it:

• | knowingly violates any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation;


• | fails to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;


• | engages in any activity or enters into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or tends to reflect, discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada;


• | engages in activities or enters into associations that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees; or


• | employs, contracts with or associates with a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of unsuitability.

 The conduct of gaming activities and the service and sale of alcoholic beverages at Wynn Las Vegas are subject to licensing, control and regulation by the CCLGLB, which has granted Wynn Las Vegas, LLC licenses for such purposes. In addition to approving Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, the CCLGLB has the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any corporation controlling a gaming license. Certain of our officers, directors and key employees have been or may be required to file applications with the CCLGLB. Clark County gaming and liquor licenses are not transferable. The County has full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license. Any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a substantial negative impact on our operations.
Massachusetts
The Massachusetts Expanded Gaming Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively the “Massachusetts Act”) subjects the owners and operators of gaming establishments to extensive state licensing and regulatory requirements. We are subject to the Massachusetts Act through our ownership interest in Wynn MA, LLC, (“Wynn MA”) which is expected to operate Encore Boston Harbor currently scheduled for completion and opening in mid-2019. 
12
The Massachusetts Act is designed to provide significant benefits to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by advancing job creation and economic development. The Massachusetts Act allows for up to three destination resort casinos (“Category 1 license”) located in three geographically diverse regions across the Commonwealth and a single slots facility, not pegged to any particular region. The licensing fee for each resort casino is $85 million and requires a capital investment, to include a hotel facility, of at least $500 million. The Commonwealth will receive 25% of gross gaming revenues.

The Massachusetts Gaming Commission (“MGC”) is responsible for issuing licenses under the Massachusetts Act and assuring that licenses are not issued or held by unqualified, disqualified or unsuitable persons. The MGC, in particular its Investigations and Enforcement Bureau (“IEB”), has extensive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants for Category 1 licenses, affiliated holding or intermediary companies, subsidiaries, directors, managers, officers, financiers and debt holders, associates, key gaming executives and employees, other gaming related employees, and other persons or entities holding a five percent or greater direct or indirect interest in the applicant, are qualified under the Massachusetts Act (with certain exemptions for institutional investors in the discretion of the Massachusetts Commission).
On December 27, 2013, the MGC determined that Wynn MA and all applicable principal individuals and entities were qualified and on September 17, 2014, designated Wynn MA the award winner of the Greater Boston (Region A) gaming license effective November 7, 2014. Wynn Resorts, its relevant subsidiaries, and individual qualifiers required to be qualified were found suitable by the MGC. Additional entities and key employees have been and will be required to file applications with the MGC and are or may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the MGC. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the MGC.
If the MGC were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the MGC may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.
While a Category 1 license has been awarded to Wynn MA, Wynn MA may not conduct gaming activities until an operations certificate has been issued by the MGC, which will be issued upon compliance with applicable provisions of the Massachusetts Act, receipt of all required permits and approvals, compliance with the conditions of Wynn MA’s Category 1 license, and Wynn MA continuing to meet applicable licensing, registration, qualification and other regulatory requirements.
The MGC has responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of the licensee and its officers, directors, employees and other designated persons. The MGC retains the authority to suspend, revoke or condition a Category 1 license, or any other license issued under the Massachusetts Act, and the IEB may levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations. All licenses issued under the Massachusetts Act are expressly deemed a revocable privilege, conditioned on the licensee’s fulfillment of all conditions of licensure, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the licensee’s continuing qualification and suitability. Among other things, the MGC is also responsible for the collection of application, license and other fees, conducting investigations of and monitoring applicants and licensees, and reviewing and ruling on complaints, and may conduct inspections of the gaming establishment premises or the licensee’s records and equipment.
Pursuant to the Massachusetts Act, the MGC may grant a gaming beverage license for the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages for a gaming establishment. The division of gaming liquor enforcement of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission has the authority to enforce, regulate and control the distribution of alcoholic beverages in a gaming establishment. The MGC may revoke, suspend, refuse to renew or refuse to transfer a gaming beverage license for violations of the Massachusetts Act that pertain to the sale and distribution of alcohol consumed on the premises and the regulations adopted by the MGC. The MGC has adopted regulations for the issuance of gaming beverage licenses. These regulations and any changes in applicable laws, regulations and procedures could have significant negative effects on our future Massachusetts gaming operations and results of operations.

Other Regulations
In addition to gaming regulations, we are subject to extensive local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These include, but are not limited to, laws and regulations relating to alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employment and immigration, currency and other transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, marketing and advertising, lending, debt collection, privacy, telemarketing, money laundering, laws and regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"). Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Seasonality
We may experience fluctuations in revenues and cash flows from month to month; however, we do not believe that our business is materially impacted by seasonality.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 26,000 employees (including approximately 13,700 in Macau and 12,300 in the United States).
Our collective bargaining agreement with the Culinary and Bartenders Union, which covers approximately 5,700 employees at Wynn Las Vegas, expires in July 2021. Our collective bargaining agreement with the Transportation Workers Union, Local 721, which covers approximately 410 of our table games dealers at the Wynn Las Vegas casino, expires in November 2020. On February 19, 2019, the United Auto Workers Union filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board seeking to replace the Transportation Workers Union as the bargaining representative for the table games dealers. An election will be held in March 2019 to make that determination. In December 2018, employees in the horticulture and transportation departments at Wynn Las Vegas voted to be represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the Company is in the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement which would cover approximately 190 employees. 
Intellectual Property
Among our most important marks are our trademarks and service marks that use the name "WYNN." Wynn Resorts has registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") a variety of WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. 
We have also filed applications with various foreign patent and trademark registries, including in Macau, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, certain European countries and various other jurisdictions throughout the world, to register a variety of WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. 
We recognize that our intellectual property assets, including the word and logo version of "WYNN," are among our most valuable assets. As a result, and in connection with expansion of our resorts and gaming activities outside the United States, we have undertaken a program to register our trademarks and other intellectual property rights in relevant jurisdictions. We have retained counsel and intend to take all steps necessary to protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use throughout the world.
Pursuant to the Surname Rights Agreement, dated August 6, 2004, Stephen A. Wynn ("Mr. Wynn") granted us our exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual, worldwide license to use, and to own and register trademarks and service marks incorporating the "Wynn" surname for casino resorts and related businesses, together with the right to sublicense the name and marks to its affiliates. Pursuant to a separation agreement, dated February 15, 2018, by and between Mr. Wynn and the Company, if we cease to use the "Wynn" surname and trademark, we will assign all of our right, title, and interest in the "Wynn" trademark to Mr. Wynn and terminate the Surname Rights Agreement. 
We have also registered various domain names with various domain registrars around the world. Our domain registrations extend to various foreign jurisdictions such as ".com.cn" and ".com.hk." We pursue domain related infringement on a case by case basis depending on the infringing domain in question. The information found on these websites is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report we file or furnish to the SEC.
