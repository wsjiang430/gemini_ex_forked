Item 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
NewLink Genetics Corporation (the "Company", "NewLink", "we", "our" or "us") is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company focused on developing novel immunotherapeutic products for the treatment of patients with cancer. Our leading small-molecule product candidates currently in clinical development target the indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase, or IDO, pathway, which is one of the key pathways for cancer immune escape. These product candidates, indoximod and NLG802 (a prodrug of indoximod), are IDO pathway inhibitors with mechanisms of action that center around breaking the immune system’s tolerance to cancer. We also have an additional small molecule product candidate, NLG207, which is a nanoparticle-drug conjugate, or NDC, consisting of a cyclodextrin-based polymer backbone linked to camptothecin, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor of the topoisomerase-1 inhibitor, camptothecin.  
In cancer, the IDO pathway regulates immune response by suppressing T-cell activation, which enables cancer to avoid immune response. IDO is overexpressed in many cancers, both within tumor cells as a direct defense against T-cell attack, and also within antigen presenting cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes, thereby promoting peripheral tolerance to tumor associated antigens, or TAAs. When hijacked by developing cancers in this manner, the IDO pathway may facilitate the survival, growth, invasion and metastasis of malignant cells whose expression of TAAs might otherwise be recognized and attacked by the immune system. 
The IDO pathway refers to a series of reactions initiated by IDO that result in the reduction of the amino acid tryptophan in the local tumor environment. We believe the local presence of tryptophan in adequate concentrations promotes antitumor T-cells, and the local reduction of tryptophan combined with the presence of the break-down product of tryptophan metabolism, kynurenine, is understood to suppress the activation of T-cells. Preclinical and, increasingly, clinical data suggest that IDO pathway inhibitors may also enhance the anti-tumor effects of other immunotherapies, chemotherapies and radiation when used as a combination therapy for patients with cancer.
We had a net loss of $53.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect to continue to have losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through clinical trials, pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates, and prepare for one or more of our product candidates receiving marketing approval.
Founded in 1999, our principal executive office is located Ames, Iowa, with additional offices located in Austin, Texas and Wayne, Pennsylvania. We have clinical, research and development staff dedicated to our pipeline of product candidates for patients with cancer and other diseases. 
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to develop and commercialize immunotherapeutic products for the treatment of patients with cancer where there are unmet needs with current therapies. The critical components of our business strategy in 2019 include:
•Advance the clinical development of indoximod in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG, recurrent pediatric brain tumors, or rPBT, and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML;
•Progress forward the clinical development of NLG207 for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer as well as advancing chemistry, manufacturing, and control, or CMC, development activities;
•Advance the clinical development of NLG802, a prodrug of indoximod with the potential for a multi-fold increase in drug exposure compared to the base formulation, in multiple cancer indications;
•Analyze the potential for the clinical development of indoximod in programmed cell death-1, or PD-1, refractory melanoma; and
•Evaluate outside opportunities for in-licensing or strategic acquisition to expand our pipeline and leverage current clinical development and financial resources.
We plan to present the following updates to our clinical trials during 2019:
•Final results for the Phase 2 Clinical Study of NLG207, a nanoparticle formulation of the topoisomerase-1 inhibitor, camptothecin, in combination with weekly paclitaxel in for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer; 
•Updated data from the efficacy portion of the Phase 1b clinical study of indoximod plus radiotherapy for pediatric patients with DIPG; 
•Updated data from a Phase 1 study of NLG802; and
•Updated Phase 1b clinical data for indoximod plus standard-of-care radio-chemotherapy for pediatric patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors.
IDO Pathway Inhibitors
We have a clinical development program focused on the IDO pathway. Our small-molecule IDO pathway inhibitor product candidates currently in clinical development include indoximod and NLG802. Our product candidates are designed to counteract immunosuppressive effects of the IDO pathway, a fundamental mechanism regulating immune response. Indoximod acts as a tryptophan mimetic, thereby signaling the activation of antitumor T-cells by the up regulation of mTOR, acts directly on T-cells, and modulates AhR-mediated effects. 
We have observed an encouraging safety profile for our IDO pathway inhibitors. They are also orally bioavailable and we believe they offer the potential to be synergistic with other therapies such as radiation, chemotherapy, vaccination and immunotherapies involving other checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1, anti-programmed cell death ligand-1, or PD-L1, or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, or CLTA4. Clinical data suggest an increase in clinical activity without adding significant toxicity.
Indoximod
Indoximod, our lead IDO pathway inhibitor, is currently in clinical development in combination with other cancer therapeutics for patients with DIPG, pediatric brain tumors, acute myeloid leukemia, and melanoma. We believe there may be additional opportunities to apply indoximod to a broader set of cancer indications. Indoximod has been studied in more than 
 800 patients to date and has been generally well-tolerated, including in combination with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, various chemotherapy agents, radiation, and a cancer vaccine.
A tablet formulation of indoximod hydrochloride, or indoximod salt, has been developed for adult patients and a sprinkle formulation is being developed for pediatric indications. We plan to use our new tablet formulation of indoximod in future clinical trials.
Two U.S. patents covering both the salt and prodrug formulations of indoximod were issued in the U.S. on August 15, 2017 and February 19, 2019 providing exclusivity until at least 2036. We are currently pursuing international patent coverage for these formulations. 
NLG207
NLG207 is an NDC consisting of a cyclodextrin-based polymer backbone linked to camptothecin, a topoisomerase-1, or top-1, inhibitor. Because the vasculature in tumors is more permeable than normal tissue, we believe NDCs have the potential to enhance drug delivery to tumors by enabling gradual payload release inside cancer cells to augment antitumor activity while reducing off-target toxicity. NLG207 is currently being studied in single agent and in combination with paclitaxel in recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. 
NLG802
NLG802 is a prodrug of indoximod. NLG802 is intended to increase bioavailability and exposure to indoximod above levels currently achievable by direct oral administration of indoximod. We filed an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the first quarter of 2017 and the first patient was dosed with NLG802 in a Phase 1 clinical trial in July 2017. The purpose of this Phase 1 trial is to assess preliminary safety and to determine the recommended dose for subsequent Phase 2 evaluations. NLG802 is a new chemical entity with patent coverage into 2036. We are also pursuing international patent coverage for NLG802.
NLG919
NLG919, a direct enzymatic inhibitor, was previously in clinical development as part of our collaboration with Genentech, Inc., or Genentech. In October 2014, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Genentech, or the Genentech Agreement. The Genentech Agreement provided for the development and commercialization of NLG919. On December 6, 2017, the Genentech Agreement with respect to NLG919 terminated. As part of the partial termination, worldwide rights to NLG919 reverted to us and Genentech granted us a license under certain of Genentech’s intellectual property to develop and commercialize NLG919. We continue to explore the potential for further development and licensing opportunities but do not have an active program for the drug product candidate as of December 31, 2018.
Under the Genentech Agreement, we conducted a two-year pre-clinical research program with Genentech to discover novel next generation IDO/tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, or TDO, inhibitors. The research program ended in November 2016, and we received notice on May 9, 2018 that Genentech would not continue the collaboration with respect to next generation IDO/TDO inhibitors identified through the research program. The Genentech Agreement terminated in its entirety on November 6, 2018 and we received control of the intellectual property portfolio related to the newly discovered TDO inhibitors, IDO inhibitors and dual IDO/TDO inhibitors.
Ebola Vaccine Candidate
In November 2014, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license and collaboration agreement, or the Merck Agreement, with Merck, Sharpe and Dohme Corp,. or Merck, to develop and potentially commercialize our rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP vaccine product candidate and other aspects of our vaccine technology. The rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP vaccine product candidate was originally developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC, and is designed to utilize the rVSV vector to induce immunity against Ebola virus when replacing the VSV glycoprotein with corresponding glycoproteins from filoviruses. Under the Merck Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $30.0 million in October 2014, and in February 2015 we received a milestone payment of $20.0 million. We have the potential to earn royalties on sales of the vaccine in certain countries, if the vaccine is approved by the FDA and successfully commercialized by Merck. rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP is also eligible to receive a priority review voucher and we are entitled to a portion of the value of the voucher if it is granted. In addition to milestone payments from Merck, we were awarded contracts for development of the rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP from the U.S. BioMedical Advanced Research & Development Authority, or BARDA, and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or
 DTRA, totaling $52.1 million during 2016 and $67.0 million during 2014 and 2015. Funds of $2.1 million were de-obligated from the DTRA grant awards in 2017. We have received total awards of $118.8 million. 
On April 26, 2018 we entered into an agreement with Merck, DTRA and BARDA to transfer the government grants from BARDA and DTRA to Merck. The transfer was completed in June 2018 and Merck has replaced us as the prime contractor on all such grants. 
Cancer Market Overview
Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States; the American Cancer Society estimated that more than 600,000 deaths will occur in 2019 and almost 1.7 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2019. Despite a number of advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer over the past decade, overall five-year survival rates from all cancer types is 63% for the period spanning 2008-2014 according to the National Cancer Institute.
Cancer is characterized by abnormal cells that grow and proliferate, forming masses called tumors. Under certain circumstances, these proliferating cells can metastasize, or spread, throughout the body and produce deposits of tumor cells called metastases. As the tumors grow, they may cause tissue and organ failure and, ultimately, death. To be effective, cancer therapies must eliminate or control the growth of the cancer.
The specialized cells of the immune system recognize specific chemical structures called antigens. Generally, foreign antigens trigger an immune response that results in the removal of disease-causing agents from the body. Cancer cells, however, frequently display antigens that are also found on normal cells. The immune system may not be able to distinguish between tumors and normal cells and therefore may be unable to mount a strong anti-cancer response. Additionally, tumors often express abnormal proteins that could be recognized by the immune system. However, tumors also have various immune-suppressive defense mechanisms that may prevent the immune system from fully activating and recognizing these abnormal antigens.
Current therapies, such as surgery, radiation, hormone treatments and chemotherapy, do not directly address this immune-evasive characteristic of cancer and may not have the desired therapeutic effect. Active immunotherapies stimulate the immune system, the body's natural mechanism for fighting disease, and may overcome some of the limitations of current standard-of-care cancer therapies.
Limitations of Current Cancer Therapies
We believe current cancer treatment alternatives suffer from a number of limitations that impair their effectiveness including:
•Toxicity. Chemotherapeutic agents are highly toxic to the human body and often cause a variety of side effects, which may include nausea and vomiting, bleeding, anemia and mucositis. Targeted therapeutics may have fewer systemic toxicities, but still tend to have off-target effects such as gastrointestinal inflammation, severe skin reactions and breathing difficulties. These effects limit a patient's ability to tolerate treatment thereby depriving the patient of the potential benefit of additional treatments or treatment combinations that might otherwise destroy or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Once educated as to the limited efficacy, limited increased survival and potentially significant toxicity of existing treatment alternatives, patients diagnosed with terminal cancer often choose to limit or forego therapy in order to avoid further compromising their quality of life. Patients with advanced stage cancer often cannot tolerate cancer therapy, and certain therapies have been shown to hasten death in some cases as the patient's health deteriorates.
•Development of resistance. While many current therapeutic approaches may be effective against a particular target, the overall impact of these therapies on treating cancer is limited because the abundance and diversity of tumor cells are believed to enable cancers to adapt and become resistant to these treatments over time resulting in reduced longer-term efficacy.
•Short-term approach. Incremental survival benefit is the primary objective of many currently marketed and development-stage cancer therapeutics. In general, many drugs show modest impact on overall survival or only affect progression-free survival. Other than surgical tumor removal, curative intent is often not a focus or realistic potential outcome of many current cancer therapies.
•Immune system suppression. Cancer is difficult to treat in part because cancer cells use sophisticated strategies to evade the immune system. Cancer treatment often involves the introduction of an agent, such as a chemical, an antibody or radiation, which causes cell apoptosis (programmed cell death) or inhibit the proliferation of all cells, including immune cells, thereby indirectly suppressing the immune system. A weakened immune system not only further inhibits the body's natural ability to fight cancer, but also causes patients to become more susceptible to infections and other diseases.
Grants and Contracts with the United States Government
Other than the upfront payments received in 2014 from Genentech and Merck, grants and contracts with the United States Government accounted for substantially all of our revenue in each of the last four fiscal years. As the prime contractor for BARDA, since December 2014, we have been awarded a total of approximately $103.0 million in funding and approximately $51.0 million of additional contract options to support the manufacturing and development activities of our Ebola vaccine product candidate. Activities included clinical development through a 330-person Phase 1b clinical trial, the scale-up of the manufacturing process related to our Ebola vaccine product candidate, and the development of the investigational rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP vaccine candidate, designated V920, designed to induce immunity against the Ebola Zaire virus. The funding supported manufacturing facility readiness, manufacturing process qualification activities, and additional clinical trials to support regulatory approval of the V920 vaccine currently being led by our partner, Merck.
We have also received funding from the United States Department of Defense to support the development of contract manufacturing for the vaccine product candidate for clinical trials. Since 2014, we have been awarded funds of approximately $15.6 million to support various development activities of our Ebola vaccine product candidate. 
Manufacturing
We currently contract with manufacturing organizations to develop and manufacture the novel formulations for indoximod, NLG802, and NLG207. We believe that many suppliers would be available for the production of these product candidates, if required. We currently have no plans to build our own manufacturing facility to support any of these product candidates.
If we were to need additional supply of NLG919, we would be responsible for the manufacturing and would seek to contract with manufacturing organizations to develop and manufacture NLG919. We currently have no plans to build our own manufacturing facility to support this product candidate.
Merck has assumed responsibility for manufacturing the Ebola vaccine product candidate in accordance with the Merck Agreement.
Sales and Marketing
We currently own exclusive worldwide commercial rights to all our product candidates other than the Ebola vaccine candidate. In the future, we may build a commercial infrastructure to support any of these products, should they receive FDA or other applicable regulatory authorization. In addition, we may pursue collaborations or co-promotion arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to complement these efforts or for particular indications or in specific territories. 
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Given the significant unmet patient need for new therapies, oncology is an area of focus for many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the discovery and research and development of products for cancer. As a result, there are and will likely continue to be extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new oncology products. In addition, there are a number of multinational pharmaceutical companies and large biotechnology companies currently marketing or pursuing the development of products or product candidates targeting the same cancer indications as our product candidates.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic collaborators, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drugs, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful in obtaining approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors' drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
We also face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private research organizations in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants and developing and acquiring technologies, obtaining patent protection, and securing sufficient capital resources for the often lengthy period between technological conception and commercial sales. Moreover, technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors, thereby preventing us from obtaining technology on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We will also compete for the services of third parties that may have already developed or acquired internal biotechnology capabilities or made commercial arrangements with other biopharmaceutical companies to target the diseases on which we have focused both inside and outside of the United States. 
Immunotherapy Products for Cancer
The cancer immunotherapy landscape is broad but still in the early stages of development as compared to more established approaches like cytotoxic chemotherapy. Several immunotherapy products to treat cancer been approved in recent years. Multiple drugs classified as checkpoint inhibitors have been approved since 2011 targeting either CTLA-4, PD-1 or PDL-1 via antibody blockade. Additionally, there have been regulatory approvals for other immunotherapies in the classes of CAR-T and oncolytic virus. The indications for which these agents have been approved include some indications that we are pursuing or plan to pursue in our clinical development. Other indications in our clinical development plan, such as malignant brain tumors and AML, do not currently have any FDA approved immunotherapies for immune checkpoint inhibitors.
We face intense competition in our development activities. We face competition from many companies in the United States and abroad, including a number of large pharmaceutical companies, firms specialized in the development and production of vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, and other immunotherapies, and major universities and research institutions. Many companies are developing or commercializing products in areas that we have targeted for product development. Some of these products use therapeutic approaches that may compete directly with our product candidates. Most of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we possess. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in conducting preclinical and nonclinical testing and human clinical trials of product candidates, scaling up manufacturing operations and obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and manufacturing facilities. We are also facing increasing competition in enrolling patients in our clinical trials. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for drugs more rapidly than we do. If we obtain regulatory approval and launch commercial sales of our product candidates, we also will compete with respect to manufacturing efficiency and sales and marketing capabilities, areas in which we currently have limited experience. 
Strategic Collaborations
Genentech Agreement
In October 2014, we entered into the Genentech Agreement for the development and commercialization of NLG919, our clinical stage IDO pathway inhibitor, and a research collaboration for the discovery of next generation IDO/TDO inhibitors to be developed and commercialized under the Genentech Agreement. Under the terms of the Genentech Agreement, we received an upfront non-refundable payment of $150.0 million in 2014 and funding for our participation in the research collaboration, which ended in November 2016. 
The agreement was terminated in part on December 6, 2017 and the rights to NLG919 reverted back to us. As part of the partial termination, Genentech granted to us an exclusive license to certain intellectual property of Genentech, to develop and commercialize NLG919, and we are obligated to pay to Genentech a royalty on future net sales of NLG919 in the low single digits. We continue to explore the potential for further development and licensing opportunities but do not have an active program for the drug product candidate as of December 31, 2018.
Under the Genentech Agreement, we conducted a two-year pre-clinical research program with Genentech to discover novel next generation IDO/tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, or TDO, inhibitors. The research program ended in November 2016, and we received notice on May 9, 2018 that Genentech would not continue the collaboration with respect to next generation IDO/TDO inhibitors identified through the research program. The Genentech Agreement terminated in its entirety on November 6, 2018.
 Merck Agreement
In November 2014, we entered into the Merck Agreement to research, develop and potentially commercialize our Ebola vaccine product candidate and certain other aspects of our vaccine technology. The Ebola vaccine product candidate was originally developed by PHAC. Under the Merck Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $30.0 million in 2014 and a
 milestone payment of $20.0 million in 2015, and we have the potential to earn royalties on sales of the vaccine in certain countries, if the vaccine is approved and if Merck successfully commercializes it. In July 2015, we announced that the international partnership studying the rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP (Ebola) vaccine candidate in Guinea released interim data suggesting that it is effective in the prevention of Ebola in a large Phase 3 clinical trial.  The rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP product candidate will continue to be studied in clinical trials. In February 2017 the final report from the trial confirmed that rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP offers substantial protection against Ebola virus disease, with no cases among vaccinated individuals without the infection from day 10 after vaccination in both randomized and non-randomized clusters.
Under the terms of the Merck Agreement, Merck is granted the exclusive rights to the Ebola vaccine product candidate. The Ebola vaccine product candidate is under a licensing arrangement with BioProtection Systems Corporation, or BPS, our wholly owned subsidiary and a licensee of PHAC. Under these license arrangements, PHAC retains non-commercial rights pertaining to the vaccine candidate. The Merck Agreement was amended on December 5, 2017 in connection with our entry into an amended and restated PHAC license on December 5, 2017. The amended Merck Agreement absolves BPS from any future obligation to negotiate or amend the terms of the PHAC license, converts the scope of Merck's sublicense under PHAC’s intellectual property rights to be non-exclusive in the Ebola Sudan field of use, and requires Merck to reimburse us in certain circumstances where we may be obligated to pay royalties to PHAC as a result of Merck’s product sales but Merck would not otherwise be obligated to pay a royalty to us.
On April 26, 2018 we entered into an agreement with Merck, DTRA and BARDA to transfer the government grants from BARDA and DTRA to Merck. The transfer was completed in June 2018 and Merck has replaced us as the prime contractor on all such grants. Merck has begun the submission of a rolling Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for V920 under the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation for V920. The approval of V920 by the FDA would trigger the issuance of a priority review voucher owned by Merck and in which we may have a substantial economic interest. Thereafter, we would have the right to monetize our share of interest in the voucher. 
Unless earlier terminated, the Merck Agreement will continue in effect for as long as Merck has royalty payment obligations to us. Merck may terminate the Merck Agreement for convenience upon a specified period of notice or for certain safety reasons with immediate effect. In the event of Merck’s uncured material breach of its obligations under the Merck Agreement with respect to a particular product, we may terminate the Merck Agreement with respect to that product. We may also terminate the Merck Agreement with respect to certain products in the event Merck pursues an alternate product under certain circumstances. Each party may terminate the Merck Agreement for the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency.
Intellectual Property
We believe that patent protection and trade secret protection are important to our business and that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain our technology licenses, maintain trade secret protection, obtain and maintain patents and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others both in the United States and abroad. We believe that obtaining identical patents and protection periods for a given technology throughout all markets of the world will be difficult because of differences in patent laws. In addition, the protection provided by non-U.S. patents, if any, may be weaker than that provided by U.S. patents. We have established and continue to build proprietary positions for our IDO pathway inhibitor technology and our NLG207 nanoparticle drug conjugate technology in the United States and abroad. As of March 5, 2019, our patent portfolio included ten patent families relating to our IDO pathway inhibitor technology and four patent families relating to NLG207. 
Our IDO pathway inhibitor technology patent portfolio contains several key U.S. patent families that protect indoximod, NLG802, and NLG919. A series of patents covering indoximod were exclusively licensed from Augusta University Research Institute, formerly known as Georgia Regents Research Institute, Georgia Health Sciences University Research Institute, Inc. and the Medical College of Georgia Research Institute. The first patent family contains two issued U.S. patents expiring in 2019 and 2021 including claims to pharmaceutical compositions of 1-methyl-tryptophan (US 8,198,265). The second patent family contains four issued U.S. patents directed to pharmaceutical compositions of indoximod (US 8,232,313, expires in 2024) and to methods of using indoximod to treat cancer (US 7,598,287, US 8,580,844 and US 9,463,239 expires in 2027, 2025, and 2024, respectively). In addition, we have two granted US patents (US 9,732,035 and US 10,207,990) and worldwide pending patent applications covering indoximod prodrugs and novel formulations of indoximod (PCT/US2016/035391). We currently have granted non-U.S. patents covering indoximod prodrugs and novel formulations of indoximod in Singapore. We cannot, however, ensure that we will be able to secure any similar patent grants in other jurisdictions.
We believe that significant barriers to entry in the IDO space are provided by a patent family covering compositions of matter and methods of use of different classes of IDO inhibitor compounds, and are fully owned by us: PCT/US2012/033245,
 which covers the IDO inhibitor compound NLG919. The national counterparts of the third family provide protection at least until 2032, not counting any patent term adjustment in the United States. This patent has been granted in the United States, Europe, Australia, China, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Peru, Russia, Chile, Colombia, and New Zealand with multiple applications pending in other countries. An additional application claiming methods of synthesis of NLG919 and related compounds is currently pending (PCT/US2018/024127). 
We have also added to our portfolio new patent applications claiming IDO inhibitors, TDO inhibitors and dual IDO/TDO inhibitors derived from our two-year research and collaboration effort with Genentech. These pending patent families are represented by their international applications PCT/CN2016/111730, PCT/US2018/038508, and PCT/US2018/039880.
Additional barriers to entry are provided through exclusive licenses with the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research, or LIMR, and various NewLink-owned inventions, in which we are pursuing patent protection for specific combination therapies targeting the IDO pathway, as well as protection for novel families of inhibitor compounds and second generation products. One patent family that covers methods of treatment of cancer have been licensed from LIMR and are represented by several international issued patents US 8,008,281, EP 2260846, JP 4921965, CN ZL200480014321.1, CA 2520172, US 8,383,613. 
Our NLG207 (formerly CRLX101) nanoparticle drug conjugate technology patent portfolio is represented by four main patent families. The main patent family claims compositions and methods of manufacturing of cyclodextrin-based polymers covalently linked to therapeutic agents for delivering the therapeutic agents to tumors, whereby the therapeutic agent is camptothecin or taxanes. This main patent family was exclusively licensed from Cerulean Pharma, Inc. by our fully owned subsidiary Bluelink Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Bluelink, to research, develop and commercialize NLG207 (along with a separate investigational product) as of March 19, 2017, and is represented by sixteen US granted patents expiring between 2023 and 2024 (US 7270808, US 8110179, US 8252276, US 8314230, US 8389499, US 8399431, US 8404662, US 8475781, US 8518388, US 8580244, US 8580242, US 8580243, US 8603454, US 8609081, US 8680202 and US 9550860), and by 58 granted international patents expiring in 2023 as well as by small number of US and international pending applications. In March of 2017, Cerulean Pharma Inc., sold its rights in the main patent family to Novartis, subject to Bluelink’s continuing exclusive license in respect of NGL207 (and the second investigational product). The second patent family, owned by Bluelink and expiring in 2030, claims methods of use of cyclodextrin-containing polymer conjugated with camptothecin and is represented by nine granted international patents (Australia, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Japan, Mexico) and pending applications in the United States, Brazil, India, Japan, Hong Kong and Mexico. A third patent family, wholly owned by Bluelink and expiring in 2034, claims methods of use of NLG207 in combination with radiation, and is represented by one granted patent in Europe (EP 3049078) and a pending application in US. A fourth patent family wholly owned by Bluelink and expiring in 2037, claims the use of cyclodextrin-containing polymer conjugated with camptothecin in combination with IDO and TDO inhibitors (PCT/US2017/ 064339). 
In order to protect the confidentiality of our technology, including trade secrets and know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the use or disclosure of confidential information. The agreements also oblige our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to assign or license to us ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by such persons in connection with their work with us. We cannot be sure that these agreements will maintain confidentiality, will prevent disclosure, or will protect our proprietary information or intellectual property, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or intellectual property.
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and patents have been applied for by, and issued to, other parties relating to products or new technologies that may be competitive with those being developed by us. Therefore, any of our product candidates may give rise to claims that it infringes the patents or proprietary rights of other parties now or in the future. Furthermore, to the extent that we, our consultants, or manufacturing and research collaborators, use intellectual property owned by others in work performed for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights to such intellectual property or in related or resulting know-how and inventions. An adverse claim could subject us to significant liabilities to such other parties and/or require disputed rights to be licensed from such other parties. A license required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be available to us, or may not be available on acceptable terms. If we do not obtain such licenses, we may encounter delays in product market introductions, or may find that we are prevented from the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in legal proceedings instituted before patent and trademark offices in the United States, the European Union, or other ex-U.S. territories, or in a suit brought against us by a private party based on such patents or proprietary rights, or in a suit by us asserting our patent or proprietary rights against another party, even if the outcome is not adverse to us.

IDO Pathway Inhibitor Technology
The following licensing agreement covers technologies and intellectual property rights related to our IDO pathway inhibitor technology and product candidates:
Augusta University Research Institute License Agreement
We are a party to a License Agreement dated September 13, 2005, or the AURI IDO Agreement, with Augusta University Research Institute, or AURI, which was formerly known as Georgia Regents Research Institute, the Georgia Health Sciences University Research Institute, Inc. and the Medical College of Georgia Research Institute. The AURI IDO Agreement was amended on March 28, 2006, April 27, 2006, February 13, 2007, July 12, 2013, July 10, 2014, and March 15, 2016. The AURI IDO Agreement grants us, including our affiliates, an exclusive, worldwide license, under specified AURI patent rights and related technology to make, use, import, sell and offer for sale products that are covered by licensed patent rights or incorporates or uses licensed technology in all medical applications.
Our license from AURI is subject to AURI's retained right to use, and to permit its academic research collaborators to use, such AURI patent rights and technology for research and educational purposes. In addition, the license is subject to certain rights of and obligations to the U.S. government under applicable law, to the extent that such intellectual property was created using funding provided by a U.S. federal agency. We may grant sublicenses under such license, subject to the prior approval of AURI, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
In consideration of such license grant, we are obligated to pay to AURI specified license fees (including issuing shares of our common stock), annual license maintenance fees, reimbursement of patent prosecution costs, potential milestone payments in an aggregate amount up to approximately $2.8 million per licensed product (which, as a result of the March 15, 2016 amendment, includes certain prodrugs of indoximod), and royalties as a single-digit percentage of net sales of the licensed products, subject to minimum royalty payments and royalty rates depending on the type of license product. In addition, if we grant a sublicense under the license granted by AURI, we must pay to AURI a percentage of the consideration we receive from the sublicensee. We made a milestone payment of $1.0 million in connection with the March 15, 2016 amendment the AURI IDO Agreement.
If we fail to develop the licensed products in a non-cancer field, specifically infectious disease or diagnostics, AURI may convert our license in such field to a non-exclusive license.
Unless terminated earlier, the AURI IDO Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last licensed AURI patents. Pending the status of certain patent applications and the payment of appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees, we expect the last patent will expire under this agreement in 2027, excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions or additional patents issued that are included under the license. AURI may terminate this agreement for our uncured material breach, bankruptcy or similar proceedings. We may terminate this agreement for AURI’s uncured material breach or upon written notice to AURI. For a period of one year following the termination of the agreement, we may sell our licensed products that are fully manufactured and part of our normal inventory at the date of termination. We have the right to assign the AURI Agreement to our affiliates or in connection with the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets relating to the agreement, but any other assignment requires the prior written consent of AURI.
Vaccines for the Biodefense Field
The following licensing agreement to which BPS is a party covers technology and intellectual property rights applicable to BPS’s development of vaccines for the biodefense field:
Public Health Agency of Canada License Agreement
BPS is a party to a license agreement with PHAC, dated May 4, 2010, which was amended and restated on December 5, 2017, or the PHAC License. Under the terms of the PHAC License, BPS has a worldwide, personal, non-transferable, sole, revocable, royalty-bearing license under specified patent rights and know-how, for the development and commercialization of products directed to the prevention, prophylaxis and treatment of Ebola (Zaire), a rVSV based on viral hemorrhagic fever, or VHF virus, and a worldwide, personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-bearing license, under specified patent rights and know-how, for the development and commercialization of products directed to the prevention, prophylaxis and treatment of Ebola (Sudan), a VHF virus. The license granted to BPS is subject to Canada’s retained rights to use the licensed patent rights and technology to improve the patent rights, carry out educational purposes, and for the development of the patent rights where BPS cannot obtain regulatory approval or meet demand. BPS may also grant sublicenses under the PHAC License,
 provided that each sublicense is consistent with the terms and conditions of the PHAC License and contain certain mandatory sublicensing provisions. 
We granted a sublicense under the PHAC License to Merck in November 2014 when we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Merck to develop and potentially commercialize our Ebola vaccine product candidate. The PHAC License provides express consent for Merck to sublicense or subcontract its sublicensed rights under certain circumstances. 
In consideration of the license grants, under the terms of the PHAC License, BPS must pay to Canada annual license maintenance fees, patent prosecution costs, potential milestone payments in an aggregate amount up to approximately $250,000, and royalties as a low single-digit percentage of the sales price of the licensed products sold by BPS, its affiliates or sublicensees in countries outside of Africa and GAVI eligible countries, which royalty rate varies depending on whether additional technology licenses are required to sell the licensed product, and whether the licensed product is covered by a valid claim of a patent licensed under the PHAC License. In addition to the milestones and royalties discussed above, BPS is required to pay to Canada a percentage in the low double digits of certain consideration BPS receives from Merck or any other sublicensee over specified thresholds. BPS is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and market the licensed products. If BPS breaches its obligations and fails to cure the breach, PHAC may terminate the PHAC License.
In November 2014, we entered into a licenses and collaboration agreement with Merck to develop and potentially commercialize our Ebola vaccine product candidate. The Merck Agreement includes a sublicense of the patents subject to the PHAC License.
Unless terminated earlier, the PHAC License will remain in effect until the earlier of (i) July 28, 2033; or (ii) such time that BPS and its sublicensees cease all development and commercialization of the technologies that are licensed to the Company under the PHAC License. Canada may terminate this agreement for BPS's failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize, failure to pay, breach of confidentiality, cessation of business, criminal conviction or other breach of its obligations under the agreement. BPS may not assign the PHAC License to a third party without the prior written consent of Canada, not to be unreasonably withheld. This agreement will terminate automatically if BPS files for bankruptcy or similar proceedings or if BPS assigns the PHAC License under certain circumstances without prior written consent of Canada.
Government Regulation
We operate in a highly regulated industry that is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our present and future business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws including, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, among others.
The FDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these laws and regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time consuming.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products, including biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, or BLAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed
 clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not objected to the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, good clinical practices, or GCP, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs, which are applications for marketing approval, are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. 
In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases such as cancer, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients rather than in healthy volunteers. Since these patients already have the target disease, these studies may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase 2 clinical trials and thus these trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1b clinical trials. Additionally, when product candidates can damage normal cells, it is not ethical to administer such drugs to healthy patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or, in the case of a biologic, a BLA, is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the marketing application is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The marketing application must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. Submission of an NDA or BLA also requires the payment of a substantial user fee, unless a waiver applies.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of marketing applications. Most such applications for non-priority drug products are reviewed within 10 months of their acceptance for filing, and for priority designated applications, within six months of their acceptance for filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information submitted during the review or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a marketing application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. The FDA may also inspect one or more non-clinical study sites to assure compliance with GLP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the proposed facility or the facilities at which the drug substance or drug product is manufactured, tested, packaged or labeled. The FDA will not approve the product unless it has compliance with GCP, GLP, and current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and the marketing application (the NDA or, in the case of biologics, the BLA) contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication or indications studied. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with FDA's general biological product standards to demonstrate that the product is safe, pure and potent.
After the FDA evaluates the marketing application and the manufacturing facilities, it issues an Approval Letter, or a Complete Response letter. A Complete Response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed in a resubmission of the marketing application, the FDA will re-initiate review. If it is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the FDA will issue an Approval Letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. It is not unusual for the FDA to issue a Complete Response letter because it believes that the drug is not safe enough or effective enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted are reliable or conclusive.
An Approval Letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indication or indications. As a condition of approval of the marketing application, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
In seeking approval for marketing of a drug or biologic through an NDA or BLA, respectively, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's product or FDA approved method of using this product. Upon approval of a product, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA's Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA applicant and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA applicant and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification notification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor, during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug.
Ongoing Regulatory Requirements
Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to
-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.
Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indication or indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. However, physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications. Companies may also share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, or in the case of biologics, a new BLA or BLA supplement, before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA and BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs and BLAs. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approval for our product candidates for any other indications or any other product candidate for any indication on a timely basis, if at all.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced, routine or for-cause inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to access compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
Federal and State Healthcare Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to increase the transparency of and restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries in recent years. These laws include the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes.
Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, are also applicable to our business. We could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters and was amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to annually report information to CMS, as defined below, related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and institutions, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. There are also state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Regulation Outside the United States
Drugs are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain approval in the United States, we will be subject to separate regulatory approval standards in foreign countries. In the E.U., for example, there is a centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of a product in all countries of the E.U. (which includes most major countries in Europe). If this procedure is not used, approval in one country of the E.U. can be used to obtain approval in another country of the E.U. under two simplified application processes, the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure, both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition. After regulatory approval is received through any of the European registration procedures, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries.
Price Controls
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. In many of the markets where we may do business in the future, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls (by law) and to reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. In the United States, the Medicare program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. Coverage and reimbursement for products and services under Medicare are determined pursuant to regulations promulgated by CMS and pursuant to CMS's subregulatory coverage and reimbursement determinations. It is difficult to predict how CMS may apply those regulations and subregulatory determinations to newly approved products, especially novel products, and those regulations and interpretive determinations are subject to change. Moreover, the methodology under which CMS makes coverage and reimbursement determinations is subject to change, particularly because of budgetary pressures facing the Medicare program. Medicare regulations and interpretive determinations also may determine who may be reimbursed for certain services.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider a drug product to be cost effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, risk sharing, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Such interest has resulted in several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, on May 11, 2018, the President Trump laid out his administration’s “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, will affect rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. Although some of these and other proposals may require additional authorization to become effective, the U.S. congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. These controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. As a result, the marketability of any product which receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.
In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. In the years since its enactment, there have been, and continue to be, significant developments in, and continued legislative activity around, attempts to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by the U.S. congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act. The Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision.
 Due to these efforts, there is significant uncertainty regarding future of the ACA, and its impact on a pharmaceutical company’s business and operations. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products that receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The approach taken varies from member state to member state. Some jurisdictions operate positive or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products, as exemplified by the role of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom, which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government. In addition, in some countries cross-border imports from low-priced markets (parallel imports) exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and biological materials. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Legal Proceedings
In addition to the legal proceedings described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe we are party to any claim or litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 55 employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor or trade union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Facilities 
Our executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in the Iowa State University Research Park in Ames, Iowa. We have approximately 26,616 square feet, comprising executive office space and space dedicated to manufacturing, testing and product storage, leased with the Iowa State University Research Park Corporation. The leases expire March 31, 2021, and we have the option to extend the leases for two additional five-year periods upon the same terms as the base lease. We lease an additional 23,544 square feet in Ames, Iowa under a lease expiring on January 31, 2020.
We lease 2,686 square feet of additional executive and administrative space in Austin, Texas under a lease expiring in November 2019. We also entered into a lease for 3,255 square feet of additional clinical, regulatory and executive offices in Wayne, Pennsylvania beginning March 1, 2018 and expiring in February 2021.
