ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leading financial firm that leverages cutting edge technology to deliver liquidity to the global markets and innovative, transparent trading solutions to our clients. Our market structure expertise, broad diversification, and execution technology enables us to provide competitive bids and offers in over 25,000 securities and other financial instruments, on over 235 venues, in 36 countries worldwide.  We use the best technology to deliver liquidity to global markets and innovative trading solutions and analytics tools to our clients. We interact directly with hundreds of retail brokers, Registered Investment Advisors, private client networks, sell-side brokers, and buy-side institutions. Our products are transparent, because we believe transparency makes markets more efficient and helps investors make better, more informed decisions.
Technology and operational efficiency are at the core of our business, and our focus on market making and order routing technology is a key element of our success. We have developed a proprietary, multi‑asset, multi‑currency technology platform that is highly reliable, scalable and modular, and we integrate directly with exchanges and other liquidity centers. Our market data, order routing, transaction processing, risk management and market surveillance technology modules manage our market making and institutional agency activities in an efficient manner that enables us to scale our activities globally across additional securities and other financial instruments and asset classes without significant incremental costs or third‑party licensing or processing fees.
We believe that technology-enabled market makers like Virtu serve an important role in maintaining and improving the overall health and efficiency of the global capital markets by continuously posting bids and offers for financial instruments and thereby providing market participants a transparent and efficient means to transfer risk. All market participants benefit from the increased liquidity, lower overall trading costs and improved execution certainty that Virtu provides.
As described in “Acquisition of KCG” below, on July 20, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), we completed our all-cash acquisition (the “Acquisition of KCG”) of KCG Holdings, Inc. (“KCG”). KCG was a leading independent securities firm offering clients a range of services designed to address trading needs across asset classes, product types and geographies. KCG combined advanced technology with specialized client service across market making, agency execution and trading venues and also engaged in principal trading via electronic market making. 
Prior to the Acquisition of KCG, Virtu operated as a single reportable business segment. As a result of the Acquisition of KCG, beginning in the third quarter of 2017, we have two operating segments: Market Making and Execution Services, and one non-operating segment: Corporate. Our management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages our business according to these segments.
We primarily conduct our Americas Equities business through our three SEC registered broker‑dealers. We are registered with the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the UK for our European trading and the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Australian Securities and Investments Commission for our Asia Pacific trading. We are registered as a market maker or liquidity provider and/or enter into direct obligations to provide liquidity on nearly every exchange or venue that offers such programs. We engage regularly with regulators around the world on issues affecting electronic trading and to advocate for increased transparency. In the U.S., we conduct our business from our headquarters in New York, New York and our trading centers in Austin, Texas and Chicago, Illinois. Abroad, we conduct our business through trading centers located in London, England, Dublin, Ireland and Singapore.

Market Making
Our Market Making segment principally consists of market making in the cash, futures, and options markets across global equities, options, fixed income, currencies and commodities. As a leading, low‑cost market maker dedicated to improving efficiency and providing liquidity across multiple securities, asset classes and geographies, we aim to provide critical market functionality and robust price competition in the securities and other financial instruments in which we provide liquidity. This contribution to the financial markets, and the scale and diversity of our market making activities, provides added liquidity and transparency, which we believe are necessary and valuable components to the efficient functioning of market infrastructure and benefit all market participants. We support transparent and efficient, technologically advanced marketplaces, and advocate for legislation and regulation that promotes fair and transparent access to markets.
As a market maker, we commit capital on a principal basis by offering to buy securities from, or sell securities to, broker dealers, banks and institutions. We engage in principal trading in the Market Making segment direct to clients as well as in a supplemental capacity on exchanges and on alternative trading systems (“ATSs”). As a complement to electronic market making, our cash trading business handles specialized orders and transacts on the OTC Link ATS operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. and the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange (“AIM”).
We make markets in a number of different asset classes, which are discussed in more detail below. We register as market makers and liquidity providers where available and support affirmative market making obligations. 
We provide competitive and deep liquidity that helps to create more efficient markets around the world. We stand ready, at any time, to buy or sell a broad range of securities, and we generate revenue by buying and selling large volumes of securities and other financial instruments and earning small bid/ask spreads.
We believe the overall level of volumes and realized volatility in the various markets we serve have the greatest impact on our businesses. Increases in market volatility can cause bid/ask spreads to widen as market participants are more willing to transact immediately and as a result market makers’ capture rate per notional amount transacted will increase.
Technology is at the core of our business. Our team of in-house software engineers develops our software and applications, and we utilize optimized infrastructure to integrate directly with the exchanges and other trading venues on which we provide liquidity. Our focus on technology and our ability to leverage our technology enables us to be one of the lowest cost providers of liquidity to the global electronic trading marketplace.
Leveraging the scalability and low costs of our platform, we are able to test and rapidly deploy new liquidity provisioning strategies, expand to new securities, asset classes and geographies and increase transaction volumes at little incremental cost. These efficiencies are central to our ability to deliver consistently positive Adjusted Net Trading Income (as defined below) as our profitability per trade and per instrument is not significant, particularly in U.S. equities.
Our transaction processing is automated over the full life cycle of a trade. Our market making platform generates and disseminates continuous bid and offer quotes. At the moment when a trade is executed, our systems capture and deliver this information back to the source, in most cases within a fraction of a second, and the trade record is written into our clearing system, where it flows through a chain of control accounts that allow us to automatically and efficiently reconcile trades, positions and payments until the final settlement occurs.
We have built and continuously refine our automated and integrated, real time systems for global trading, risk management, clearing and cash management, among other purposes. We have also assembled a proprietary connectivity network between us and exchanges around the world. Efficiency and speed in performing prescribed functions are always crucial requirements for our systems, and generally we focus on opportunities in markets that are sufficiently advanced to allow the seamless deployment of our automated strategies, risk management system and core technology.
Our systems are monitored 24 hours a day, five days a week by our core operations team and are substantially identical across our offices, in New York, New York; Austin, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Dublin, Ireland; London, England; and Singapore. This redundancy covers our full technology platform, including our market data, order routing, transaction processing, risk management and market surveillance technology modules.

Clients and Products 
We offer direct-to-client market making services across multiple asset classes primarily to sell-side clients including global, national and regional broker dealers and banks as well as buy-side clients comprising, among others, mutual funds, pension plans, plan sponsors, hedge funds, trusts and endowments in North America, Europe and Asia. 
We generally compete based on execution quality, market coverage, payment for order flow, and client service. In direct-to-client electronic market making in U.S. equities, execution quality is generally measured based on factors that include speed of execution, fulfillment rates, opportunity and amounts of price improvement, using metrics defined in SEC Rule 605. In other asset classes, metrics for execution quality are are not prescribed by applicable regulation, and in many cases, are client defined. 
We continually work to provide clients with high quality, low-cost trade executions that enable them to satisfy their fiduciary obligation to seek the best execution on behalf of the end client. We continually refine our automated order routing models so that we may remain competitive.
Americas Equities
We trade over 25,000 listed Americas equity securities including, among others, equity related futures and exchange traded products, on thirteen U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) registered exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the NASDAQ, NYSE Arca, Cboe BATS, Chicago Stock Exchange, the TSX in Canada, Bovespa in Brazil and BMV in Mexico, as well as other ATSs and more than 20 private liquidity pools. 
As exchange traded products, or “ETPs,” and other similar products have proliferated both domestically and internationally, demand has increased for trading the underlying assets or hedging such funds. Our technology has enabled us to expand into providing liquidity to this growing area by making markets across these assets in a variety of trading venues globally. We are authorized participants, and can create and/or redeem ETPs in the Americas. As of December 31, 2018, we are the Lead Market Maker or Designated Liquidity Provider in over 600 ETPs listed in the Americas.
Rest of World (“ROW”) Equities
Similar to our strategy in the Americas, in ROW trading we utilize direct connections to all of the registered exchanges in a particular jurisdiction including the London Stock Exchange, Cboe BATS Europe, NYSE Euronext, Six Swiss Exchange, Australian Securities Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange and Singapore Exchange, as well as other trading venues and additional pools of liquidity to which we can gain access either directly or through a broker. 
We are also well positioned in European ETPs, as an authorized participant in many European ETPs. We are authorized participants in over 2,000 ETPs and can create and/or redeem ETPs listed outside the Americas. As of December 31, 2018, we are the registered Market Maker in over 500 ETPs listed abroad.
We increased our presence in APAC equities in 2016 by acquiring a minority stake in SBI Japannext Co., Ltd. (“SBI”), a leading Proprietary Trading System in Japan.
Global FICC, Options, and Other
Our Fixed Income market making includes our activity in U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt, corporate bonds, and other debt instruments. We trade these products on a variety of specialized exchanges, direct to counterparties, and other trading venues, including BrokerTec, eSpeed, DealerWeb, and BGS’s Fenics UTS.
Our Currencies market making, including spot, futures and forwards, comprises our activity in over 80 currencies, including deliverable, non-deliverable, fiat, and digital currencies, across dozens of venues and direct to counterparties. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we were a leading participant in the major foreign exchange venues, including Reuters, Currenex, Cboe FX and NEX. 
Our Commodities market making takes place on the CME, ICE, and Nasdaq Futures in crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, and gasoline futures. We trade approximately 100 energy products and futures on the ICE, CME, and TOCOM. We also actively trade precious metals, including gold, silver, platinum and palladium, as well as base metals such as aluminum and copper.
6

Our Options and Other market making includes our activity on all of the U.S. options exchanges of which we are a member (i.e., Cboe, ISE and NYSE Arca) and through the U.S. futures exchanges. 
Execution Services
Virtu offers agency execution services in global equities, ETFs and fixed income to institutions, banks and broker dealers. We generally earn commissions as an agent when executing orders on behalf of clients. Agency based trading is done primarily through: (a) algorithmic trading and order routing; (b) institutional sales traders who offer portfolio trading and single stock sales trading which provides execution expertise for program, block and riskless principal trades in global equities and ETFs; and (c) matching of client orders in Virtu MatchIt (our registered ATS for U.S. equities). Additionally we act as principal on occasions, either when we manually work an order for a client, or more often, via electronic trading algorithms, executing against our firm’s liquidity. We also earn technology services revenues by providing our proprietary technology and infrastructure to select third parties for a service fee.
Clients and Products 
We offer agency execution services across multiple asset classes to buy-side clients including mutual funds, pension plans, plan sponsors, hedge funds, trusts and endowments and sell-side clients including global, national and regional broker dealers and banks in North America, Europe and Asia. In 2018 our Execution Services segment did not have any client that accounted for more than 10% of our commissions earned.
Clients may access a broad range of products and services that includes electronic execution services in global equities via algorithmic trading, order routing and an execution management system (“EMS”) as well as internal crossing through our registered ATS. Our ATS provides clients with anonymous sources of non-displayed liquidity. We also offer clients voice access to global markets including sales and trading for equities, ETFs and options. We handle large complex trades, accessing liquidity from our order flow and other sources. We provide soft dollar and commission recapture programs.
In this segment, we generally compete on trading technology, execution performance, costs, client service, market coverage, liquidity, platform capabilities and anonymity. We draw on in-house developed trading technologies to meet client criteria for execution quality and for managing trading costs. As a result, we are able to attract a diverse array of clients in terms of strategy, size and style. We also provide algorithmic trading and order routing that combine technology, access to our differentiated liquidity and support from experienced professionals to help clients execute trades.
Corporate
Our Corporate segment contains investments principally in strategic financial services-oriented opportunities and maintains corporate overhead expenses and all other income and expenses that are not attributable to our other segments.
Risk Management
We are focused on risk management and it is at the core of our trading infrastructure. Our real time risk controls monitor all of our market making positions, incorporating market data and evaluating our risk exposure to continuously update our outstanding bid and offer quotes, often many times per second. Although the majority of our market making is automated, the trading process and our risk exposure are monitored by a team of individuals, including members of our senior management team, who oversee our risk management processes in real-time. Our risk management system is intrinsic to our trading infrastructure that is utilized in each of our trading centers.
Our on exchange market making strategies are designed to put minimal capital at risk at any given time by limiting the notional size of our positions. Our strategies are also designed to lock in returns through precise hedging in the primary instrument or in one or more economically equivalent instruments, as we seek to eliminate the price risk in any positions held. Our real‑time risk management system is built into our trading platform and is an integral part of our order life‑cycle, analyzing real‑time pricing data and confirming that our order activity is conducted within strict pre‑determined trading and position limits. If our risk management system detects that a trading strategy is generating revenues or losses in excess of our preset limits, it will lockdown that strategy and alert management. 
The market making activities, where we interact with customers, involve the taking of position risks. The risks at any point in time are limited by the notional size of positions as well as other factors. The overall portfolio risks are quantified using internal risk models and monitored by the Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”), the independent risk group and senior management.
7

In addition, our risk management system continuously reconciles our internal transaction records against the records of the exchanges and other liquidity centers with which we interact.
Our risk management policies and risk limits are set by our Risk Advisory Committee, and overseen by our CRO, who also reports independently into the Board Risk Committee.
We utilize the following approach to managing risk:

• | On Exchange Market Making Strategy Lockdowns. Messages that leave our trading environment must first pass through a series of preset risk controls, or “lockdowns,” which are intended to minimize the likelihood of unintended activities by our market making algorithms. Our preset risk controls are designed to limit both downside and upside risk. Following a lockdown, the applicable trading strategy must be manually reset. While this risk prevention layer adds a degree of latency to our trading infrastructure and can prevent us from earning outsized returns in times of extreme market volatility, we believe that this trade-off is necessary to properly limit our downside risk.


• | Customer Market Making Model Restrictions. All models have limits in place which restrict individual position sizes, sector exposures and imbalanced portfolios with significant directional risks. Strategies are designed to automatically reduce exposures when limits are reached. The models are monitored by the trading team and the risk managers constantly. 


• | Aggregate Exposure Monitoring. Pursuant to our risk management policies, our automated management information systems monitor in real‑time and generate report on daily and periodic bases. Exposures monitored include: 


◦ | Risk Profiles


◦ | Statistical Risk Measures including Value at Risk, and Equity Betas


◦ | Stress and Scenario analysis


◦ | Concentration measures


◦ | Profit and Loss analysis


◦ | Trading performance reports


• | Our assets and liabilities are marked‑to‑market daily for financial reporting purposes by reference to official exchange prices, and they are re‑valued continuously throughout the trading day for risk management and asset/liability management purposes.


• | Operational Controls. We have a series of fully automated controls over of our business. Key automated controls include: 

8


◦ | Our technical operations system continuously monitors our network and the proper functioning of each of our trading centers around the world;


◦ | Our market making system continuously evaluates the listed securities in which we provide bid and offer quotes and changes its bids and offers in such a way as to minimize exposure to directional price movements. The speed of communicating with exchanges and market centers is maximized through continuous software and network engineering innovation, allowing us to achieve real‑time controls over market exposure. We connect to exchanges and other electronic venues through a network of co‑location facilities around the world that are monitored 24 hours a day, five days a week, by our staff of experienced network professionals;


◦ | Our clearing system captures trades in real-time and performs automated reconciliations of trades and positions, corporate action processing, options exercises, securities lending and inventory management, allowing us to effectively manage operational risk;


◦ | Software developed to support our market making systems performs daily profit and loss and position reconciliations; and


◦ | After event reviews where operational issues are evaluated and risk mitigations are identified and subsequently implemented.


• | Credit Controls. Trading notional limits are applied to customers and counterparts. These are monitored throughout the day by trading support and risk.


• | Liquidity Controls. We seek to minimize liquidity risk by focusing the majority of trading in highly active and liquid instruments. Less liquid securities are identified and restrictions are in place as to the size of positions we hold in such instruments.

We rely on technology and automation to perform many functions within Virtu. Cyber threats are a risk that we are exposed to as a result of our heavy reliance on technology. These threats could include the introduction of malicious code or unauthorized access, and could result in data loss or destruction, business interruption, and the unavailability of service and other risks. We have taken steps to mitigate the various cyber threats, and we devote resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and networks and review the ever-changing threat landscape. We have created a Risk Advisory Committee, which includes key personnel from each of our locations globally and is comprised of our CRO and our Chief Compliance Officer, members of our senior management team, senior technologists and traders, and certain senior officers. We will continue to periodically review policies and procedures to seek to ensure they are effective in mitigating current cyber and other information security threats. In addition to the policy reviews, we continue to look to implement technology solutions that enhance preventive and detection capabilities. We also maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks. However, such insurance may be insufficient to cover all losses or may not provide any coverage.
Our board of directors, through the Board Risk Committee, is regularly apprised of risk events, risk profiles, trends and the activities of our Risk Advisory Committee, including our risk management policies, procedures and controls.
Competition
Historically, our competition has been registered market making firms ranging from sole proprietors with very limited resources to large, integrated broker‑dealers. Today, a range of market participants may compete with us for revenues generated by market making activities across one or more asset classes and geographies, including market participants, such as Citadel Securities, Susquehanna International Group LLP, Two Sigma, Jane Street, DRW Holdings, IMC, and Optiver. Some of our competitors in market making are larger than we are and have more captive order flow in certain assets. We believe that the high cost of developing a competitive technological framework is a significant barrier to entry by new market participants.
Technology and software innovation is a primary focus for us, rather than relying solely on the speed of our network. We believe that our scalable technology allows us to access new markets and increase volumes with limited incremental costs.
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
We rely on federal and state laws that govern trade secrets, trademarks, domain names, copyright and contract law to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. We enter into confidentiality, intellectual property invention assignment and/or non‑competition and non‑solicitation agreements or restrictions with our employees, independent contractors and business partners, and we control access to, and distribution of, our intellectual property.
9

Employees
As of February 7, 2019, we had approximately 483 employees, all of whom were employed on a full‑time basis. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Regulation
We conduct our U.S. equities and options market making and provide execution services through our three SEC‑registered broker‑dealers, Virtu Financial BD LLC, Virtu Financial Capital Markets LLC, and Virtu Americas LLC. Virtu Financial BD LLC is a self‑clearing broker‑dealer, is regulated by the SEC and its designated examining authority is the Chicago Stock Exchange. Both Virtu Americas LLC and Virtu Financial Capital Markets LLC are dual‑clearing broker‑dealers (which means each self‑clears certain proprietary and customer transactions and clears and settles the majority of customer transactions through fully disclosed clearing arrangements), are regulated by the SEC and their designated examining authority is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”).
Our activities in U.S. equities are primarily self‑cleared. We are a full clearing member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), and the DTCC. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated acts as our clearing broker and carries and clears, on a fully disclosed basis, accounts for our institutional customers and acts as a prime broker for certain of our market making accounts. In other asset classes, we use the services of prime brokers who provide us direct market access to markets and often cross‑margining and margin financing in return for an execution and clearing fee. We continually monitor the credit quality of our prime brokers and rely on large multinational banks for most of our execution and clearing needs globally.
Our energy, commodities and currency market making and trading activities are primarily conducted through Virtu Financial Global Markets LLC.
We conduct our European, Middle Eastern and African (“EMEA”) market making and trading activities and provide execution services from Dublin and through our Irish subsidiary, Virtu Financial Ireland Limited, which is authorized as an “Investment Firm” with the Central Bank of Ireland. Virtu Financial Ireland Limited maintains a branch office in London.
We conduct our Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) market making and trading activities from Singapore and through our Singapore subsidiary, Virtu Financial Singapore Pte. Ltd. Virtu Financial Singapore Pte. Ltd. is registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore for an investment incentive arrangement.
Most aspects of our business are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the various self-regulatory organization (“SROs”) of which our broker-dealer subsidiaries are members. The SEC, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), state securities regulators, FCA, the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”), FINRA, National Futures Association (“NFA”), other SROs and other U.S. and foreign governmental regulatory bodies promulgate numerous rules and regulations that may impact our business. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors in those markets. Regulated entities are subject to regulations concerning all aspects of their business, including, but not limited to, trading practices, order handling, best execution practices, anti‑money laundering and financial crimes, handling of material non‑public information, safeguarding data, compliance with exchange and clearinghouse rules, capital adequacy, reporting, record retention, market access and the conduct of officers, employees and other associated persons. Virtu Americas LLC carries certain customer accounts and is therefore subject to applicable SEC requirements relating to the protection of customer securities and the maintenance of a cash reserve account for the benefit of customers.
Rulemaking by these and other regulators (foreign and domestic), including resulting market structure changes, has had an impact on our regulated subsidiaries by directly affecting our method of operation and, at times, our profitability. Legislation can impose, and has imposed, significant obligations on broker‑dealers, including our regulated subsidiaries. These increased obligations require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls which have increased our costs and may subject us to government and regulatory inquiries, claims or penalties.
Failure to comply with any laws, rules or regulations could result in administrative or court proceedings, censures, fines, penalties, judgments, disgorgement, restitution and censures, suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction, SRO or market, the revocation or limitation of licenses, the issuance of cease‑and‑desist orders or injunctions or the suspension or disqualification of the entity and/or its officers, employees or other associated persons. From time to time, we are the subject of requests for information and documents from the SEC, FINRA and other regulators. In is our practice to cooperate and comply with the requests for information and documents. These requests could lead to administrative or court proceedings. Whether or 
10

not they result in adverse findings, they can require substantial expenditures of time and money and can have an adverse impact on a firm’s reputation, customer relationship and profitability.
The regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to constant change. Our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the U.S. Congress, foreign legislative bodies, state securities regulators, U.S. and foreign governmental regulatory bodies and SROs. Additional regulations, changes in existing laws and rules, or changes in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws and rules often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of regulated broker‑dealers. We cannot predict what effect, if any, future legislative or regulatory changes might have. However, there have been in the past, and could be in the future, significant technological, operational and compliance costs associated with the obligations which derive from compliance with such regulations. Regulators may propose market structure changes particularly considering the continued regulatory scrutiny of high frequency trading, alternative trading systems, market fragmentation, colocation, access to market data feeds, and remuneration arrangements such as payment for order flow and exchange fee and rebate structures.
The SEC and other Regulatory Bodies have enacted and are actively considering rules that may affect our operations and profitability. Among these are changes the SEC has made to Reg NMS Rule 606, changes the SEC is considering to Rule 605 which are intended to provide additional information on order routing and execution quality. Regulation ATS-N recently became effective and requires operators of alternative trading systems to provide additional information regarding the ATS and other business of the operator that may pose conflicts. Broker-dealers will be subject to the reporting requirements under the Reg NMS Plan providing for a Consolidated Audit Trail of equities and options data effective November 15, 2019. The SEC has adopted NMS Rule 610T to conduct a transaction fee pilot (the “Pilot”) designed to generate data that will help the SEC analyze the effects of exchange transaction fee and rebate pricing models on order routing behavior, execution quality, and market quality generally. Data from the Pilot will be used to facilitate an empirical evaluation of whether the exchange transaction-based fee and rebate structure is operating effectively to further statutory goals and whether there is a need for any potential regulatory action in this area. The Pilot is expected to start in late 2019. These changes and others impose additional technological, operational and compliance costs on us and creates uncertainty with regard to their effects.
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd‑Frank Act was enacted in the U.S. Implementation of the Dodd‑Frank Act is being accomplished through extensive rulemaking by the SEC, the CFTC and other governmental agencies. The Dodd‑Frank Act includes the “Volcker Rule,” which significantly limits the ability of banks and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading, and Title VII, which provides a framework for the regulation of the swap markets. The CFTC has largely finalized its rules with respect to those swaps markets and participants it regulates, while the SEC has not yet completed all of its rules relating to security‑based swaps. One of our subsidiaries is registered with the CFTC as a floor trader, and is exempt from registration as a swap dealer based on its current activity. Registration as a swap dealer would subject our subsidiary to various requirements, including those related to capital, conduct, and reporting.
We have foreign subsidiaries and plan to continue to expand our international presence. The market making industry in many foreign countries is heavily regulated, much like in the U.S. The varying compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions and other factors may limit our ability to conduct business or expand internationally. MiFID, which was implemented in November 2007, has been replaced by a more prescriptive MiFIR Regulation and MiFID II. MiFID II represents the most significant change to take place in the operation of European capital markets to date and became effective on January 3, 2018. MiFID II introduces requirements for increased pre and post trade transparency, technological and organizational requirements for firms deploying algorithmic trading techniques, restrictions on dark trading, and the roll out of a new bi-lateral OTC equity trading regime called the Systematic Internaliser regime. MiFID II will require European firms to conduct all trading on European Trading Venues including Regulated Markets, Multilateral Trading Facilities, Systematic Internalisers or equivalent third country venues, require market makers like us to post firm quotes at competitive prices and will supplement current requirements with regard to investment firms’ pre-trade risk controls related to the safe operation of electronic systems. MiFID II also imposes additional requirements on trading platforms, such as additional technological requirements, clock synchronization, microsecond processing granularity, pre-trade risk controls, transaction reporting requirements and limits on the ratio of unexecuted orders to trades. Each of these requirements imposes additional technological, operational and compliance costs on us. New laws, rules or regulations as well as any regulatory or legal actions or proceedings, changes in legislation or regulation and changes in market customs and practices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital rules of the SEC, FINRA, other SROs and foreign regulators. These rules, which specify minimum capital requirements for our regulated subsidiaries, are designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker‑dealer and require that at least a minimum part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Failure to maintain required minimum capital may subject a regulated subsidiary to a fine, requirement to cease conducting business, suspension, revocation of registration or expulsion by applicable regulatory authorities, and 
11

ultimately could require the relevant entity’s liquidation. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Failure to comply with applicable regulatory capital requirements could subject us to sanctions imposed by the SEC, FINRA and other SROs or regulatory bodies.”
Corporate History
We and our predecessors have been in the electronic trading and market making business for more than 15 years. We conduct our business through Virtu Financial LLC (“Virtu Financial”) and its subsidiaries. We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in April 2015, after which shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the "Class A Common Stock") began trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “VIRT.” 
Prior to our IPO, we completed a series of reorganization transactions (the “Reorganization Transactions”) pursuant to which, among other things, we acquired equity interests in Virtu Financial as a result of certain mergers involving wholly owned subsidiaries of ours, an affiliate of Silver Lake Partners and Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited ("Temasek"), and an affiliate of Temasek (the “Temasek Pre-IPO Member”) (the “Mergers”), and in exchange we issued to an affiliate of Silver Lake Partners (such affiliate, the “Silver Lake Post-IPO Stockholder”) and an affiliate of Temasek (such affiliate, the “Temasek Post-IPO Stockholder”, and together with the Silver Lake Post-IPO Stockholder, the “Investor Post-IPO Stockholders”), shares of our Class A Common Stock and rights to receive payments under a tax receivable agreement described below, we became the sole managing member of Virtu Financial, all of the existing equity interests in Virtu Financial were reclassified into non-voting common interest units (“Virtu Financial Units”), our certificate of incorporation was amended and restated to authorize the issuance of four classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock (as defined below), Class C Common Stock (as defined below) and Class D Common Stock (as defined below), and the holders of Virtu Financial Units other than us subscribed for shares of Class C common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the "Class C Common Stock) or Class D common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the "Class D Common Stock") (in the case of the Founder Post-IPO Member, as defined below) in an amount equal to the number of Virtu Financial Units held by such member. 
The Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock each provide holders with one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, and the Class B Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the "Class B Common Stock") and Class D Common Stock each provide holders with 10 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. The holders of Class C Common Stock and Class D Common Stock do not have any of the economic rights (including rights to dividends and distributions upon liquidation) provided to holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Shares of our common stock generally vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. 
On July 20, 2017, the Company completed the all-cash Acquisition of KCG.
