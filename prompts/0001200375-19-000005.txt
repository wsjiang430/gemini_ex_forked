ITEM 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
We discover, develop and sell proteins that deliver value to our clients in a growing set of industries. We view proteins as a vast untapped source of value-creating materials, and we are using our proven technologies, which we have been continuously improving over our sixteen-year history, to commercialize an increasing number of novel proteins, both as proprietary Codexis products and in partnership with our customers.
We are a pioneer in the harnessing of computational technologies to drive biology advancements. Since our inception in 2002, we have made substantial investments in the development of our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform, the primary source of our competitive advantage. Our technology platform is powered by proprietary, artificial intelligence-based, computational algorithms that rapidly mine our large and continuously growing library of protein variants’ performance attributes. These computational outputs enable increasingly reliable predictions for next generation protein variants to be engineered, enabling delivery of targeted performance enhancements in a time-efficient manner. In addition to its computational prowess, our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform integrates additional modular competencies, including robotic high-throughput screening and genomic sequencing, organic chemistry and process development, which are all coordinated to create our novel protein innovations.
Our approach to developing commercially viable biocatalytic manufacturing processes begins by conceptually designing the most cost-effective and practical process for a targeted product. We then develop optimized protein catalysts to enable that process design using our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology. Engineered protein catalyst candidates - many thousands for each protein engineering project - are then rapidly screened and validated in high throughput screening under relevant manufacturing operating conditions. This approach results in an optimized protein catalyst enabling cost-efficient processes that typically are relatively simple to run in conventional manufacturing equipment. This also allows for the efficient technical transfer of our process to our manufacturing partners.
The successful embodiment of our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform in commercial manufacturing processes requires well-integrated expertise in a number of technical disciplines. In addition to those directly involved in practicing our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology, such as molecular biology, enzymology, microbiology, cellular engineering, metabolic engineering, bioinformatics, biochemistry and high throughput analytical chemistry, our process development projects also involve integrated expertise in organic chemistry, chemical process development, chemical engineering, fermentation process development and fermentation engineering. Our integrated, multi-disciplinary approach to biocatalyst and process development is a critical success factor for our company.
We initially commercialized our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform and products in the pharmaceuticals market, which remains our primary business focus. Our customers, which include many large global pharmaceutical companies, use our technology, products and services in their manufacturing processes and process development.
We have also used the technology to develop protein catalysts for use in the fine chemicals market. The fine chemicals market consists of several large market verticals, including food and food ingredients, animal feed, flavors, fragrances and agricultural chemicals.
We have also begun using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to develop early stage, novel biotherapeutic product candidates, both for our customers and for our own business, most notably our lead program for the potential treatment of phenylketonuria ("PKU") in humans. PKU is an inherited metabolic disorder in which the enzyme that converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine is deficient. In October 2017, we entered into a Global Development, Option and License Agreement (the "Nestlé Agreement") with Nestec Ltd. ("Nestlé Health Science") to advance CDX-6114, our enzyme biotherapeutic product candidate for the potential treatment of PKU. In February 2019, Nestlé Health Science exercised its option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize CDX-6114.
In April 2018, we entered into a strategic agreement (the "Porton Agreement") with Porton Pharma Solutions, Ltd. ("Porton") to license key elements of our platform technology to Porton’s global custom intermediate and active pharmaceutical ingredients ("API") development and manufacturing business. This gives us access to a wide variety of small and medium-sized pharmaceutical customers.

We are also using our technology to develop enzymes for customers using next generation sequencing ("NGS") and polymerase chain reaction ("PCR/qPCR") for in vitro molecular diagnostic and genomic research applications. Our first enzyme is a ligase which we began marketing to customers in 2018.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We manage our business as two business segments: Performance Enzymes and Novel Biotherapeutics. See Note 15, "Segment, Geographical and Other Revenue Information" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Performance Enzymes
We initially commercialized our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform and products in the pharmaceuticals market, and to date this continues to be our largest market served. Our customers, which include many large global pharmaceutical companies, use our technology, products and services in their manufacturing processes and process development. We have also used the technology to develop customized enzymes for use in other industrial markets. These markets consist of several large industrial verticals, including food and food ingredients, animal feed, flavors, fragrances, and agricultural chemicals. We also use our technology to develop enzymes for customers using NGS and PCR/qPCR for in vitro molecular diagnostic and molecular biology research applications. In April 2018, we entered into the Porton Agreement related to our strategic collaboration with Porton to license key elements of our world-leading biocatalyst technology for use in Porton’s global custom intermediate and API development and manufacturing business.
Novel Biotherapeutics
We are also targeting new opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry to discover, improve, and/or develop biotherapeutic drug candidates. We believe that our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology can be used to discover novel biotherapeutic drug candidates that will target human diseases that are in need of improved therapeutic interventions. Similarly, we believe that we can deploy our platform technology to improve specific characteristics of a customer’s pre-existing biotherapeutic drug candidate, such as its activity, stability or immunogenicity. Most notable is our lead program for the potential treatment of hyperphenylalaninemia (“HPA”) (also referred to as PKU) in humans. PKU is an inherited metabolic disorder in which the enzyme that converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine is deficient. In October 2017, we announced a strategic collaboration with Nestlé Health Science to advance CDX-6114, our own novel orally administrable enzyme therapeutic candidate for the potential treatment of PKU. In July 2018, we announced that we had dosed the first subjects in a first-in-human Phase 1a dose-escalation trial with CDX-6114, which was conducted in Australia. In November 2018, we announced top-line results from the Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers with CDX-6114. In December 2018, Nestlé Health Science became obligated to pay us an additional $1.0 million within 60 days after the achievement of a milestone relating to formulation of CDX-6114. In January 2019, we received notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) that it had completed its review of our investigational new drug application (“IND”) for CDX-6114 and concluded that we may proceed with the proposed Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study in healthy volunteers in the United States. In February 2019, Nestlé Health Science exercised its option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license for the global development and commercialization of CDX-6114 for the management of PKU. As a result of the option exercise, Nestlé Health Science is obligated to pay us $3.0 million within 60 days after exercise of the option. Upon exercising its option, Nestlé Health Science has assumed all responsibilities for future clinical development and commercialization of CDX-6114, with the exception of the completion of an extension study, CDX - 6114-004, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2019. See Note 16, “Subsequent Events” in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details.
We have also developed a pipeline of other biotherapeutic drug candidates in which we expect to continue to make additional investments with the aim of advancing additional product candidates targeting other therapeutic areas.
OUR STRATEGY
Our strategy is to grow our revenues, profits, and stockholder value by leveraging our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform in the following ways:

• | Licensing our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to license our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to third parties so they can create cost-saving protein catalyst solutions utilizing their own in-house protein engineering capability.


• | Growing our pharmaceutical protein catalysts business. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities in the pharmaceutical market to use our protein catalysis products and services to reduce the costs for manufacturing small

5

molecule drugs. We intend to increase the number of pharmaceutical customers and processes that utilize and benefit from our novel, cost-saving protein catalyst solutions. 

• | Creating and advancing novel biotherapeutic drug candidates. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to apply our protein engineering capabilities to the creation and development of novel biotherapeutic drug candidates, both in partnership with customers and as proprietary Codexis drug candidates. We have also invested in research and development in an effort to generate additional early stage novel biotherapeutic candidates.


• | Growing our fine chemicals protein catalysts business. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities in the fine chemicals market to use protein catalysis products and services to reduce the costs for manufacturing in adjacent markets like food and food ingredients. We intend to increase the number of fine chemical customers and processes who utilize and benefit from our novel, cost-saving protein catalyst solutions.


• | Developing high-performance enzymes for use in diagnostic applications. We intend to offer high-performance enzymes to customers using NGS and PCR/qPCR for in vitro molecular diagnostic applications.

In this Annual Report, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Codexis, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
OUR MARKET OPPORTUNITIES
Pharmaceutical Market
We believe the pharmaceutical industry represents a significant market opportunity for us and is our primary business focus. Pharmaceutical companies are in constant search for new drugs to offer to their customers, and are under significant competitive pressure both to reduce costs and to increase the speed to market for their products. To meet these pressures, pharmaceutical companies are discovering and developing novel protein-based drug products, as well as seeking manufacturing processes for their new and existing drugs that reduce overall costs, simplify production and increase efficiency and product yield, while not affecting drug safety and efficacy. Cost reduction is even more important to developers (known as innovators) of patent-protected pharmaceutical products when the patents for those products expire and such innovators are forced to compete with manufacturers of generic drugs.
The pharmaceutical product lifecycle begins with the discovery of new chemical entities and continues through preclinical and clinical development, regulatory review and approval, commercial scale-up, product launch, and, ultimately, patent expiration and the transition from branded to generic products. As innovators develop, produce and then market products, manufacturing priorities and processes evolve. Historically, innovators have focused on production cost reduction in the later stages of clinical development and have been reluctant to make process changes after a product has been launched. However, as pressures to reduce costs have increased, innovators have pursued cost reduction measures much earlier in the pharmaceutical product lifecycle and are increasingly looking for opportunities to improve their operating margins, including making manufacturing process changes for marketed products after the products have been launched if these changes can result in significant cost reductions. As a result, innovators are investing in new technologies, including our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform, to improve their manufacturing productivity and efficiency or outsourcing the manufacture of their intermediates and APIs.
Our Solutions for the Pharmaceutical Market 
Small Molecule Manufacturing Cost Reduction
Our pharmaceutical customers, which include many large global pharmaceutical companies, use our technology, products and services in their manufacturing processes and process development. Our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform enables us to deliver solutions to our customers in this market by developing and delivering optimized protein catalysts that perform chemical transformations at a lower cost and improve the efficiency and productivity of manufacturing processes. We provide value throughout the pharmaceutical product lifecycle. Our products and services allow us to provide benefits to our pharmaceutical customers in a number of cost saving ways, including any - and sometimes all - of the following:
•reducing the use of raw materials and reagents; 
•eliminating multiple steps in the manufacturing process;
•improving purity, productivity and yield; 
•using water as a primary solvent; 
•eliminating hazardous inputs; 
•enabling the use of simple equipment and reducing the need for capital expenditure;
•reducing energy requirements; 
6

•reducing the generation of chemical byproducts or waste; and
•reducing the need for late-stage purifications. 
Early in a pharmaceutical product’s lifecycle, pharmaceutical manufacturers can use our protein catalyst products and services to reduce manufacturing costs. If an innovator incorporates our products or processes into an approved product, we expect the innovator to continue to use our products or processes at least over the patent life of the marketed drug.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers can also use our products and services to reduce manufacturing costs after a product is launched. At this stage, changes in the manufacturing process originally approved by the drug regulator may require additional regulatory review. Typically, pharmaceutical companies will only seek regulatory approval for a manufacturing change if substantial cost savings are realizable. We believe that the cost savings associated with our products may lead our customers to change their manufacturing processes for approved products and, if necessary, seek regulatory approval of the new processes which incorporate our proteins. Moreover, we believe these cost savings are attractive to generics manufacturers, who compete primarily on price.
In addition, manufacturing processes that utilize our protein catalysts can frequently enable processes that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly compared to alternative, traditional manufacturing approaches. This has led us to earn three U.S. EPA Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge awards for improved pharmaceutical manufacturing processes since we were founded. All three of these awards were associated with blockbuster drug products.
Discovery and Development of Biotherapeutic Drug Candidates
We are also targeting new opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry to discover or improve biotherapeutic drug candidates for our customers. We believe that our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology can be used to discover novel biotherapeutic drug candidates that will target human diseases that are in need of improved therapeutic interventions. Similarly, we believe that we can deploy our platform technology to improve specific characteristics of a customer’s pre-existing biotherapeutic drug candidate, such as its activity, stability or immunogenicity.
We approach biopharmaceutical companies to collaborate and utilize our platform technology for the discovery of specific novel biotherapeutic candidates. We currently have one such biotherapeutic discovery partnership in progress under the strategic collaboration agreement with Nestlé Health Science. We continue to pursue other customers who could benefit by applying our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology to improve the discovery and/or development of other biotherapeutics in partnership with us.
Biotherapeutic Product Discovery and Development
We are also using our platform technology to self-fund the development of our own early stage, novel enzyme therapeutic product candidates. The lead product candidate is CDX-6114, an enzyme which we have engineered to be orally administered and is being developed as a potential treatment of PKU in humans. PKU is an inborn metabolic disorder in which the enzyme that converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine is deficient. As a result, phenylalanine accumulates to toxic levels in the brain, causing serious neurological problems including intellectual disability, seizures and cognitive and behavioral problems. To avoid toxic levels of phenylalanine in their blood, individuals with PKU must follow a strict, life-long diet that is low in phenylalanine and supplement their diet with a synthetic phenylalanine-free formula to provide them with sufficient nutrients. Maintaining a strict, life-long diet can be challenging for individuals with PKU. There are an estimated 50,000 people with PKU in the developed world.
In addition to the PKU program, we have focused our self-funded biotherapeutic investments with aim to discover therapeutic solutions for four additional rare disease conditions. Two of those programs are targeting potential enzyme replacement treatments for patients with inborn errors of amino acid metabolism diseases. The other two programs are targeting potential treatments for patients with lysosomal storage diseases. We expect to continue to make additional investments with the aim of generating additional product candidates targeting these, and potentially other therapeutic areas.
Nestlé Health Science
On October 12, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into a Global Development, Option and License Agreement (the “Nestlé Agreement”) with Nestlé Health Science and, solely for the purpose of the integration and the dispute resolution clauses of the Nestlé Agreement, Nestlé Health Science S.A., pursuant to which we granted to Nestlé Health Science, under certain of our patent rights and know-how: (i) an option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicenseable license to develop and commercialize certain products (each, a “Product”) based on CDX-6114 and our other therapeutic enzyme product candidates covered by specified patent applications for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninemia (“HPA”), and (ii) an exclusive right of first negotiation (the “Right of First Negotiation”) for a period of five years to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize up to two enzymes discovered by us for use in the field of the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and 
7

management of inborn errors of amino acid metabolism. We are not under any obligation to undertake any research and development activities relating to inborn errors of amino acid metabolism. HPA (also referred to as PKU) is a medical condition characterized by elevated concentrations of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood. PKU can result in severe HPA. 
In February 2019, Nestlé Health Science exercised its option to receive an exclusive license to further develop and commercialize CDX-6114 and our other therapeutic enzyme product candidates covered by specified patent applications for the treatment of PKU (each, a “Compound”). Under the terms of the Nestlé Agreement, upon option exercise, Nestlé Health Science received a license to the Compound, other than any enzyme that has other clinically significant, specified activity against another molecule, unless that enzyme’s specified activity against phenylalanine is ten times greater than its activity against such other molecule (in which case it is not excluded). Furthermore, we generally will retain the right to use any enzyme as a biocatalyst, provided that preclinical development of such enzyme has not commenced. The first Compound to be developed under the Nestlé Agreement was our enzyme CDX-6114. 
The Nestlé Agreement also sets forth the parties’ respective obligations for development, commercialization, regulatory and manufacturing and supply activities for CDX-6114 and Product containing CDX-6114. Prior to Nestlé Health Science exercising its option to receive an exclusive license to CDX-6114, we were generally responsible for development activities, including conducting a Phase 1a clinical study. Upon exercising its option, Nestlé Health Science has assumed all responsibilities for future clinical development and commercialization of CDX-6114, with the exception of the completion of an extension study, CDX - 6114-004, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2019. Our development activities were governed by a development plan and overseen by a joint steering committee. The parties established a patent committee to discuss strategies and coordinate activities for the patents related to CDX-6114 and Product containing CDX-6114, and we will jointly own all inventions and information that result from each party’s activities performed under the Nestlé Agreement. The Nestlé Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties by the parties, intellectual property protection provisions, certain indemnification rights in favor of each party and customary confidentiality provisions and limitations of liability.
Nestlé Health Science paid us an upfront cash payment of $14.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. In July 2018, we announced that we had dosed the first subjects in a first-in-human Phase 1a dose-escalation trial with CDX-6114 which was conducted in Australia. In November 2018, we announced top-line results from the Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers with CDX-6114. In January 2019, we received notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) that it had completed its review of our investigational new drug application (“IND”) for CDX-6114 and concluded that we may proceed with the proposed Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study in healthy volunteers in the United States. In February 2019, Nestlé Health Science exercised its option to obtain an exclusive license for the global development and commercialization of CDX-6114 for the management of PKU. The exercise of the option triggers a $3 million milestone payment. Upon exercising its option, Nestlé Health Science has assumed all responsibilities for future clinical development and commercialization of CDX-6114, with the exception of the completion of an extension study, CDX - 6114-004, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2019. See Note 16, “Subsequent Events” in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details.
Other potential payments from Nestlé Health Science to us under the Agreement include (i) development and approval milestones of up to $86.0 million, (ii) sales-based milestones of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate, which aggregate amount is achievable if net sales exceed $1.0 billion in a single year, and (iii) tiered royalties, at percentages ranging from the middle single digits to low double-digits, of net sales of products containing an enzyme covered by the agreement as its sole active ingredient.
In addition to the Nestlé Agreement, we and Nestlé Health Science concurrently entered into a strategic collaboration agreement pursuant to which we and Nestlé Health Science are collaborating to leverage the CodeEvolver® platform technology to develop novel enzymes for Nestlé Health Science’s established Consumer Care and Medical Nutrition business areas.
Fine Chemicals and Industrial Enzyme Markets
Beyond the pharmaceutical industry, our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology has enabled cost-savings for our partners in the fine chemicals markets, and the food industry in particular. In November 2016, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Tate & Lyle, a market-leading food ingredients company, to supply a proprietary enzyme for use in Tate & Lyle’s food ingredient production. In March 2017, we announced a second multi-year research and development services agreement with Tate & Lyle for the development of a second ingredient for the food ingredient industry. We engineered a suite of enzymes that enable Tate & Lyle’s novel bioconversion route for the manufacture of their newly-launched zero-calorie TASTEVA® M Stevia sweetener.
We are seeking to expand our enzyme offerings in the fine chemical and industrial enzyme markets within and beyond the food industry, including, for example, to the animal feed, agricultural chemicals and flavors and fragrances markets.

Molecular Biology and In Vitro Diagnostic Enzymes 
We believe that our Codexis protein engineering capability can also be deployed to commercialize novel enzymes as improvements to enzymes consumed by customers in many industrial sectors. As our first effort in this strategy, we have developed an enzyme for customers using NGS and PCR/qPCR for in vitro molecular diagnostic applications. Our first proprietary enzyme for this market targets improved library preparation for NGS users and is currently being beta tested. We are also currently working on a second enzyme, a DNA polymerase, which is being prepared for beta testing.
Licensing Our CodeEvolver® Protein Engineering Technology Platform
Our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform enables rapid development of custom-designed enzymes that are highly optimized for efficient manufacturing processes. We intend to continue to enter into license arrangements with third parties that will allow them to use our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to discover and develop novel proteins for their internal use. To date, we have entered into platform technology licensing agreements with each of GlaxoSmithKline and Merck.
GlaxoSmithKline
We entered into our first CodeEvolver® protein engineering Platform Technology Transfer, Collaboration and License Agreement (“GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement”) on July 10, 2014 with GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited, a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline plc (collectively, “GSK”), pursuant to which we granted GSK a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform in the field of human healthcare for its internal development purposes.
Under the GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement, we transferred our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to GSK over a twenty-one-month period that began on July 10, 2014. As a part of this technology transfer, we provided to GSK our proprietary enzymes, proprietary protein engineering protocols and methods, and proprietary software algorithms. In addition, teams of our and GSK scientists participated in technology training sessions and collaborative research projects at our laboratories in Redwood City, California and at GSK’s laboratories in Upper Merion, Pennsylvania. The technology transfer was completed in April 2016 and our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform has been installed at GSK’s Upper Merion, Pennsylvania site. We have the potential to receive additional contingent payments that range from $5.75 million to $38.5 million per project based on GSK's successful application of the licensed technology. 
We are also eligible to receive royalties based on net sales, if any, of a limited set of products developed by GSK using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform.
The licenses to GSK were granted under certain patents, patent applications and know-how that we owned or controlled as of the effective date of the GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement and that cover our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform and certain enzymes useful in the Field. Any improvements to our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform during the technology transfer period were included in the license grants from us to GSK.
Under the GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement, GSK owns (the “GSK-Owned Technology”) (a) any enzyme technology that was developed during a project under the GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement that used our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform during the technology transfer period and (b) the methods of use of any Project Enzyme in compound synthesis that were developed during the technology transfer period. GSK granted to us a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use outside of the GSK Exclusive Field, the GSK-Owned Technology that was developed during the technology transfer period.
Until July 10, 2019 (the “Embargo Period”), GSK is prohibited from using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform for the use, research or development (whether in vitro or in vivo) or commercialization of any enzyme or enzyme fusion protein that (a) effects a chemical transformation in humans or (b) facilitates, assists, transports or enables the action, dispersion, absorption or bioavailability of a molecule, biologic agent, drug product, therapeutic agent or other compound in humans (the “Embargo Field”). GSK is permitted to use our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform during the Embargo Period to develop and use an enzyme or enzyme fusion protein that (x) is used by GSK solely as a research reagent or a research tool within the Embargo Field, (y) is used to synthesize a small-molecule compound owned or controlled by GSK or (z) facilitates, assists, transports or enables the action, dispersion, absorption or bioavailability of a small-molecule compound that is owned or controlled by GSK.
The term of the GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement continues, unless earlier terminated, until the expiration of all payment obligations under the GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement. GSK can terminate the GSK CodeEvolver® Agreement by providing 90 days written notice to us.

Merck
On August 3, 2015, we entered into a CodeEvolver® platform technology transfer and license agreement (the “Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement”) with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. (collectively, “Merck”).
The Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement allows Merck to use our proprietary CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology in the field of human and animal healthcare. 
Under the terms of the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement, we granted to Merck a non-exclusive worldwide license to use the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to research, develop and manufacture novel enzymes for use by Merck in its internal research programs (“Merck Non-Exclusive Field”). The license to Merck is exclusive for the research, development and manufacture of novel enzymes for use by Merck in the chemical synthesis of therapeutic products owned or controlled by Merck (“Merck Exclusive Field”). Merck has the right to grant sublicenses to affiliates of Merck and, in certain limited circumstances, to third parties. We also granted to Merck a license to make or have made products manufactured using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform with a right to grant sublicenses solely to affiliates of Merck, contract manufacturing organizations and contract research organizations. The manufacturing license is exclusive in the Merck Exclusive Field and non-exclusive in the Merck Non-Exclusive Field. The licenses are subject to certain limitations based on pre-existing contractual obligations that apply to the technology and intellectual property that are the subject of the license grants. The licenses do not permit the use of the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to discover any therapeutic enzyme, diagnostic product or vaccine. In addition, Merck is prohibited from using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to develop or produce enzymes or any other compounds for or on behalf of any third parties except in a very limited manner when Merck divests a therapeutic product that is manufactured using an enzyme developed using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform.
Under the terms of the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement, Merck paid us $18.0 million comprised of up-front technology transfer and license fees and milestone payments over the technology transfer period of 15 months from August 3, 2015, the effective date of the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement. We also have the potential to receive product-related payments of up to $15.0 million for each API that is manufactured by Merck using one or more enzymes that have been developed or are in development using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform during the 10-year period that begins on the conclusion of the 15-month technology transfer period. These product-related payments, if any, will be paid by Merck to us for each quarter that Merck manufactures API using a CodeEvolver®-developed enzyme. The payments will be based on the total volume of API produced using the CodeEvolver®-developed enzyme. We have the right to conduct an annual audit to confirm that all payments that are owed to us have been paid in full and on time.
Under the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement, we transferred the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform to Merck over the period from August 2015 through September 2016. As part of this technology transfer, we provided to Merck our proprietary enzymes, proprietary protein engineering protocols and methods, and proprietary software algorithms. We provided additional enzyme evolution services to Merck at our laboratories in Redwood City through November 2016. The remaining deferred revenue relating to the upfront payment was recognized upon completion of the additional enzyme evolution services.
The licenses to Merck are granted under patents, patent applications and know-how that we owned or controlled as of the effective date of the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement and that cover the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform. Any improvements to the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform during the technology transfer period are also included in the license grants from Codexis to Merck. Following the technology transfer period, Merck can exercise annual options that, upon payment of certain option fees, would extend Merck’s license to include certain improvements to the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform that arise during the three-year period that begins at the end of the technology transfer period.
Under the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement, we own any improvements to our protein engineering methods, processes and algorithms that arose and any enzyme technology or process technology that are developed during an evolution program or additional services. Merck owns (the “Merck-Owned Technology”) (a) any enzyme technology that is developed solely by Merck under the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform (a “Project Enzyme”) and (b) the methods of use of any Project Enzyme or any enzyme developed jointly by Merck and us using the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform. Merck granted to us a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use the Merck-Owned Technology outside of the Merck Exclusive Field.

For each API that Merck manufactures using an enzyme developed with the CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology platform, we will have a right of first refusal to supply Merck with the enzyme used to manufacture the API if Merck outsources the supply of the enzyme. Our right of first refusal applies during the period that begins on the completion of a phase III clinical trial for the product containing the API and ends five years following regulatory approval for such product.
The Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement has a term that continues, unless earlier terminated, until the expiration of all payment obligations under the agreement. Merck may terminate the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement by providing 90 days written notice to us. We can terminate the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement by providing 30 days written notice to Merck if we determine, pursuant to our contractual audit rights under the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement, that Merck has repeatedly failed to make required payments to us and/or materially underpaid us an amount due under the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement. In the event the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement is terminated earlier by Merck, or by us due to an uncured material breach by Merck, or if Merck sells or transfers to a third party any Merck business or facility that includes any of our proprietary materials, information or technology, we have the right to conduct an audit of Merck’s facilities to confirm that all of our proprietary materials, information and technology have been destroyed. The Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement contains indemnification provisions under which Merck and we have agreed to indemnify each other against certain third party claims.
In September 2016, we completed the full transfer of the engineering platform technology and earned milestone revenue of $8.0 million. We received the $8.0 million milestone payment in the fourth quarter of 2016. In October 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement whereby we amended certain licensing provisions and one exhibit. In January 2019, we entered into an amendment to the Merck CodeEvolver® Agreement whereby we will install certain CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology upgrades into Merck’s platform license installation and maintain those upgrades for a multi-year term.

In these collaborations, we typically receive consideration in the form of one or more of the following: up-front payments, milestone payments, payments for screening and engineering services, licensing fees and royalties.
Protein Catalysts
We often sell protein catalysts (also referred to as biocatalysts or enzymes), by the gram or kilogram, that have already been engineered, scaled up, and installed in a customer’s commercial process. For example, we sell protein catalysts to Merck for their manufacture of Sitagliptin, the active ingredient in Januvia®. We also sell protein catalysts which are in developmental stages. These are enzymes that are sold in batches or by the gram or kilogram that are in the process of being engineered or scaled up by Codexis, or are in the process of being trialed or approved for use in the customer’s process. We may sell batches of specific protein catalysts that are in the middle of our protein engineering efforts to test their performance at a larger customer scale. We also may sell batches of specific protein catalysts for use in a customer’s developmental products (for example, to trial in a customer’s Phase II drug candidate process). Finally, we may sell batches of specific protein catalysts as a customer performs trials for approval in their commercial manufacturing operations.
Chemical Intermediates
In some cases, we sell intermediate chemicals products that are produced in a process that uses our protein catalysts. These chemical intermediates are then used by our customer for further chemical processing.

Codex® Biocatalyst Panels and Kits
We sell kits and panels of our protein catalysts. These kits and panels assemble a relevant subset of our engineered enzymes to enable customers to perform chemistry screening on their own. These kits and panels are organized by specific types of chemical reactions that are widely applicable in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical markets. 
Protein Catalyst Screening Services
If a customer prefers, rather than purchasing our Codex® Biocatalyst Panels or Kits to use for its own screening, it may send us its starting materials and desired chemical reaction, and we will test against our existing libraries of enzymes on a research and development service fee basis. If we detect desired activity in a specific enzyme, we can supply the customer with this enzyme or perform engineering services to improve the performance of the enzyme.
Protein Engineering Services
We work with our customers throughout their product development lifecycle to optimize enzymes that have been engineered specifically to perform a desired process according to a highly selective set of specifications. We typically charge customers for research and development services by project or project-month. These are typically larger research and development service fees than screening services.
The protein engineering process starts by identifying genes that code for enzymes known to have the general type of catalytic reactivity for a desired chemical reaction. Typically, we identify gene sequences from our extensive in-house collection or from published databases and then synthesize candidate genes having those sequences. Using a variety of biotechnology tools, we diversify these genes by introducing mutations, giving rise to changes in the enzymes for which they encode. The methods for diversifying these genes, and types of diversity being tested, often vary over the course of a protein engineering program. For finding initial diversity, methods typically include random mutagenesis and site-directed (included computational structure-guided) mutagenesis. We also test mutational variations from related enzymes found in different organisms.
Once we have identified potentially beneficial mutations, we create libraries of thousands of variants with combinations of these mutations. With our proprietary genetic manipulation tools, we generate libraries of genes that have programmed and random combinations of the mutations for testing. The pool of genes is used to transform host cells, which entails introducing the various genes into host cells. These cells are then grown into colonies. Cells from individual colonies are cultured in high throughput to produce the enzyme encoded by the genetic variant in those cells. The enzymes expressed by these cells are then screened in high throughput using test conditions relevant to the desired process. The screening results allow us to identify and catalog individual genes that produce improved enzymes with beneficial mutations as well as enzymes having detrimental ones. Using specifically developed test conditions and analytical methods, we can identify variant enzymes that exhibit various improved performance characteristics, such as stability, activity and selectivity, under conditions relevant to the desired chemical process.
In the next step in our optimization process, we use our proprietary bioinformatics software to analyze protein sequence-activity relationships. Our software and algorithms relate the screening results to the mutations and rank the individual and interacting protein sequence mutations with regard to their degree of benefit or detriment, relative to the process parameter(s) tested. Using this information, we can create a select pool of mutational diversity in the next iteration to further the accumulation of beneficial diversity and cancel out detrimental diversity in the individual genes in the resulting library. The gene that codes for the best performing enzyme in one iteration is used as the starting gene for the next iteration of recombination and screening. As the enzymes improve over these iterations, the screening conditions are made increasingly more stringent. In this way, the protein catalyst is rapidly optimized until all in-process performance requirements have been achieved and the economic objectives for the desired process have been met.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary products and technology under patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. We also rely heavily on confidential disclosure agreements for further protection of our proprietary products and technologies. Protection of our technologies is important for us to offer our customers and partners proprietary services and products that are not available from our competitors, and to exclude our competitors from practicing technology that we have developed or exclusively licensed from other parties. For example, our ability to supply innovator pharmaceutical manufacturers depends on our ability to supply proprietary enzymes or methods for making pharmaceutical intermediates or APIs that are not available from our competitors. Likewise, in the generic pharmaceutical area, proprietary protection, through patent, trade secret or other protection of our enzymes and methods of producing a pharmaceutical product is important for us and our customers to maintain a lower cost production advantage over competitors.

As of December 31, 2018, we owned or controlled approximately 1,100 issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. These patents and patent applications include many that are directed to our enabling technologies and specific methods and products that support our business in the pharmaceutical markets. In addition, our portfolio includes applications and patents that support our businesses in the biotherapeutics, molecular diagnostics, food and other markets. Our current intellectual property rights have terms that expire between 2019 and 2039. Our United States intellectual property rights directed to the CodeEvolver® proprietary enabling technology platform developed internally by us have terms that expire between 2029 to 2034. Our current intellectual property rights also include patents, trademarks, copyrights, software and certain assumed contracts that we acquired from Maxygen, Inc. (“Maxygen”) in October 2010, which are associated with directed evolution technology, known as the MolecularBreeding™ technology platform developed by Maxygen. The intellectual property rights and assets that we acquired from Maxygen continue to be subject to existing exclusive and non-exclusive license rights granted by Maxygen to third parties. We continue to file new patent applications, for which terms generally extend 20 years from the non-provisional filing date in the United States. 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned and used the following registered, pending, and common law trademarks in the United States, with some trademarks also registered or pending in foreign jurisdictions: Codexis®, Codex®, CodeEvolver®, Mosaic®, Sage®, Microcyp®, MCYP®, ProSAR®, Unlock the Power of Proteins®, Codexis Protein Engineering Experts™, and a Codexis design mark (i.e., the Codexis logo).
COMPETITION
We face differing forms of competition in the small molecule pharmaceuticals, biotherapeutics, and fine chemicals markets, as set forth below.
Small Molecule Pharmaceuticals
We market our protein catalyst products and services to manufacturers of small molecule pharmaceutical intermediates and APIs. Our primary competitors in that market are companies marketing either conventional, non-enzymatic catalysts or alternative protein catalyst products and services. We also face competition sometimes from existing in-house technologies (both biocatalysts and conventional catalysts) within our client and potential client companies. The principal methods of competition and competitive differentiation in this market are price, product quality and performance, including manufacturing yield, safety and environmental benefits and speed of delivery of product. Pharmaceutical manufacturers that use biocatalytic processes can face increased competition from manufacturers that use more conventional processes and/or manufacturers that are based in regions (such as India and China) with lower regulatory, safety and environmental costs.
The market for the manufacture and supply of APIs and intermediates is large with many established companies. These companies include many of our large innovator and generic pharmaceutical customers, such as Merck, GSK, Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., which have significant internal research and development efforts directed at developing processes to manufacture APIs and intermediates. The processes used by these companies include classical conventional organic chemistry reactions, chemo catalytic reactions, biocatalytic reactions or combinations thereof. Our protein catalyst based manufacturing processes must compete with these internally developed routes. 
Companies developing and marketing conventional catalysts include Solvias AG, BASF, Johnson-Mathey, and Takasago International Corporation.
The market for supplying enzymes for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing is quite fragmented. There is competition from large industrial enzyme companies, such as Novozymes, as well as subsidiaries of larger contract research/contract manufacturing organizations (“CRO/CMO”), such as Royal DSM N.V. (“DSM”), Cambrex Corporation and Almac Group Ltd. There is also competition in the customized and optimized enzyme area from several smaller companies, such as BRAIN AG, Arzeda, c-LEcta GmbH and Evocatal GmbH. 
We believe that our principal advantage is our ability to rapidly deliver customized protein catalysts for existing and new intermediates and APIs in the pharmaceutical manufacturing market. This capability has allowed us to create a breadth of protein catalysts with improved performance characteristics including, for example, better activity, stability, and activity on a range of substrates, compared to traditional chemistry-based manufacturing processes and naturally occurring (and thus not optimized) biocatalysts. We believe that our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology provides substantially superior results, in shorter time frames, than companies offering competing biocatalyst development services. 
13

Biotherapeutics
There are other companies that participate in the biotherapeutics market generally and the PKU market specifically. Many of these companies are large, successful and well-capitalized. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (“BioMarin”) and Daiichi Sankyo Company market Kuvan® in the United States, Europe and Japan for the treatment of a certain type of PKU. In addition, BioMarin gained US FDA approval in 2018 and began commercial sales of PalynziqTM as an injectable enzyme substitution therapy for the potential treatment of PKU. Synlogic is developing SYNB1618 as a potential treatment for PKU, and in 2018, they completed a phase 1/2a clinical trial using SYNB1618. Takeda (who recently acquired Shire Plc), Genzyme / Sanofi S.A. and other companies market or are actively developing new enzyme therapeutics. There are numerous companies that are developing other forms of therapeutics, such as small molecules and gene therapy, which could compete with biotherapeutics.
Fine Chemicals
We entered the fine chemicals market in 2013 by applying our protein engineering technology in the food market. We face similar forms of competition in this market as in the small molecule pharmaceutical markets, with the exception that the risk of losing opportunities to larger competitors in fine chemicals is greater given the larger scale of opportunities available in the fine chemicals market compared to the pharmaceutical market. Our significant competitors in the fine chemicals markets include companies that have been in these marketplaces for many years, such as DuPont Industrial Biosciences (DuPont Genencor), DSM, Novozymes and A.B. Enzymes. These companies have greater resources in these markets than we do and have long-term supply arrangements already in place with customers. Our ability to compete in these markets may be limited by our relatively late entrance. We also face competition in both the fine chemicals and small molecule pharmaceutical markets from emerging companies, like Zymergen and Gingko Bioworks who offer engineered microbe metabolic pathway approaches to these markets.
Core Technology
We are a leader in the field of protein engineering to create novel biocatalysts. Both our pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals businesses rely on our core technology. We are aware that other companies, organizations and persons have developed technologies that appear to have some similarities to our patented proprietary technologies. For example, we are aware that other companies, including DSM and BASF, have alternative methods for obtaining and generating genetic diversity or use mutagenesis techniques to produce genetic diversity. In addition, academic institutions such as the California Institute of Technology, the Max Planck Institute and the Austrian Centre of Industrial Biotechnology are also working in this field. This field is highly competitive with companies and academic and research institutions actively seeking to develop technologies that could be competitive with our technologies.
Technological developments by others may result in our products and technologies, as well as products manufactured by our customers using our biocatalysts, becoming obsolete. We monitor publications and patents that relate to directed molecular evolution to be aware of developments in the field and evaluate appropriate courses of action in relation to these developments. 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, personnel and marketing resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to develop competing and/or superior technologies and processes, and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors.
OPERATIONS
Our corporate headquarters are located in Redwood City, California and provide general administrative support to our business and are the center of our research, development and business operations. We have limited internal manufacturing capacity at our headquarters in Redwood City. We expect to rely on third-party manufacturers for commercial production of our biocatalysts for the foreseeable future. Our in-house manufacturing is dedicated to producing both Codex® Biocatalyst Panels and Kits and enzymes for use by our customers in pilot scale production. We also supply initial commercial quantities of biocatalysts for use by our collaborators to produce pharmaceutical intermediates and manufacture biocatalysts that we sell. Please see Note 15 in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our revenues and long-lived assets both within and outside of the United States.
Our research and development operations include efforts directed towards engineering protein catalysts, bioprocess development, cellular engineering, biocatalyst screening, metabolites, strain improvement, fermentation development and process engineering. We conduct enzyme evolution, enzyme production development, microbial bioprocess development, cellular engineering, microbial evolution and process engineering evaluations and design primarily at our headquarters in Redwood City, California. For more information on our research and development expenditures, see Item 8 of this Annual 
14

Report on Form 10-K. Manufacturing of our enzymes is conducted primarily in three locations, at our in-house facility in Redwood City, California and at third-party contract manufacturing organizations, Lactosan, GmbH & Co. KG (“Lactosan”) in Kapfenberg, Austria and DPhar SpA (“DPhar”) in Agnani, Italy. Generally, we perform smaller scale manufacturing in-house and outsource the larger scale manufacturing and a large percentage of our production of novel enzymes to contract manufacturing organizations.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, its implementing regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our biotherapeutic product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a biologics license application (“BLA”) and licensure, which constitutes approval, by the FDA before being marketed in the United States. If we or our development partners fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during product development, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. 
The process required by the FDA before our biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials in the United States may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication, conducted in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice (“GCP”) regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA; 


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing (“cGMP”) regulations; and


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or distribution of the product.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Preclinical and Clinical Trials
Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which must be conducted in accordance with GLP requirements. The results of preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An independent institutional review board (“IRB”) for each investigator site proposing to participate in a clinical trial must also review and approve the clinical trial before it can begin at that site, and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including requirements for informed consent.
For purposes of BLA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.

• | Phase 1-Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety,

15

dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.

• | Phase 2-Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosage and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.


• | Phase 3-Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.

In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
Although most clinical research performed in the United States in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA, under the IND regulations and procedures described above, there are certain circumstances under which clinical trials can be conducted without submission of an IND. For example, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the biologic in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA Submission and FDA Review
The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the biologic, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee unless a waiver is granted. Each BLA submitted to the FDA is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days of the FDA’s receipt of the application. If the BLA is found to be complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full substantive review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission.
Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180 days to review the application and respond to the applicant. However, the review process is often significantly longer. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of reviewing BLAs within ten months of the 60-day filing date for standard review or six months for priority review, but the overall timeframe is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the biological product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility or facilities in which it is manufactured meet standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured, and will not license the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance with GCP requirements.
The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than sponsors. Once the FDA approves a BLA, such approval defines the indicated uses for which the biologic may be 
16

marketed. The FDA may also require implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which can include a medication guide, communication plan, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, physician training, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling claims or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and it may limit further marketing based on the results of these post-marketing studies. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the proposed change, a BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented.
Post-Approval Requirements
Licensed biologics that are manufactured and distributed in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug program user fee.
Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us, our partners or our contract manufacturers pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to ongoing regulation by the FDA. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose extensive procedural and documentation requirements. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available biologics for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
Biosimilars and Regulatory Exclusivity
As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCIA”) established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The abbreviated regulatory pathway provides legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics based on their similarity to an existing brand product, referred to as a reference product, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable with a brand product. Under the BPCIA, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for a reference product in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological drug products is not yet clear and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. The BPCIA is complex and continues 
17

to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate implementation and impact are subject to uncertainty. In addition, the period of exclusivity provided by the BPCIA only operates against third parties seeking approval via the abbreviated pathway, but would not prevent third parties from pursuing approval via the traditional BLA approval pathway.
