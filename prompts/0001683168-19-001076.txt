ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
As used in this Annual Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” refer to DarkPulse Inc, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
 
Corporate Overview 
 
Organization
 
DarkPulse, Inc. ("DPI", “DarkPulse” or the "Company") is a technology-security company incorporated in 1989 as Klever Marketing, Inc ("Klever"). Its principal wholly-owned subsidiary, DarkPulse Technologies Inc. ("DPTI"), originally started as a technology spinout from the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada. DPI is comprised of two security platforms: Fiber and Ultra-High Sensitivity Sensors ("UHSS").
 
On April 27, 2018, Klever entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement” or the “Merger”) involving Klever as the surviving parent corporation and acquiring DPTI as its wholly-owned subsidiary. On July 18, 2018, the parties closed the Merger Agreement, as amended on July 7, 2018, and the name of the Company was subsequently changed to DarkPulse, Inc. With the change of control of the Company, the Merger was accounted for as a recapitalization in a manner similar to a reverse acquisition.
 
On July 20, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Delaware, changing the name of the Company to DarkPulse, Inc. The Company filed a corporate action notification with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Company's ticker symbol was changed to DPLS.
 
The Company’s security and monitoring systems will initially be delivered in applications for border security, pipelines, the oil and gas industry and mine safety. Current uses of fiber optic distributed sensor technology have been limited to quasi-static, long-term structural health monitoring due to the time required to obtain the data and its poor precision. The Company’s patented BOTDA dark-pulse sensor technology allows for the monitoring of highly dynamic environments due to its greater resolution and accuracy.
 
In December 2010 DPTI entered into an Assignment Agreement with the University of New Brunswick, Canada (“the University”), pursuant to which the University sold, transferred, and assigned to the Company certain patents related to the University’s BOTDA dark-pulse technology (the "Patents") in exchange for the issuance of a debenture to the University in the amount of C$1,500,000 (Canadian dollars). In April 2017, DPTI entered into an Intellectual Property agreement with the University in exchange for the issuance of a replacement debenture to the University in the amount of US$1,491,923 (the “Debenture”). The Patents and the Debenture were initially recorded in the Company’s accounts at $1,491,923, based upon the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Canadian dollar on December 16, 2010, the date of the original debenture. In addition to the repayment of principal and interest, the Debenture requires DPTI to pay the University a two percent royalty on sales of any and all products or services which incorporate the Patents for a period of five years commencing on April 24, 2018, as well as to reimburse the University for its patent-related costs.
 
On September 5, 2017, DarkPulse Technology Holdings Inc. (“Holdings”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Bravatek Solutions Inc., a publicly-held Colorado corporation (“Bravatek”), pursuant to which Bravatek was to promote the company’s products and the Company was to cross-promote Bravatek’s products and services, and Bravatek would be paid sales commissions for customers introduced to the Company by Bravatek.

On February 8, 2018, the Company formed DarkPulse BVTK, LLC, a Virginia Limited Liability Company (“JV Entity”). The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DPTI, holds a 60% equity interest in the JV Entity, and Bravatek has a 40% interest. The primary business purpose of the JV Entity was to develop, market, and sell products and services based on the Company's patented BOTDA dark-pulse technology ("Licensed Technology"). Both the CEO of the Company and the CEO of Bravatek were to manage the day to day operations of the JV Entity. The JV Entity is considered a variable interest entity, of which Bravatek is considered the primary beneficiary. The Company's interest in JV Entity is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company previously granted the JV Entity a revocable, royalty-free non-exclusive license to use the Licensed Technology in North America, Asia, and European government, military and critical infrastructure/key resources market segments. The initial cash contribution to JV Entity from Bravatek was $10,000, and the initial cash contribution to JV Entity from the Company was $100. As of December 31, 2018, Bravatek contributed cash totaling $87,000 to the JV Entity. On March 26, 2019, DPTI informed the JV Entity and Bravatek that, effective immediately, DPTI was revoking from the JV Entity the revocable Licensed Technology exclusively owned by DPTI and the Company, as further described herein under “Note 14 - Subsequent Events”.
 
Our Business
 
The Company offers a full suite of engineering, installation and security management solutions to industries and governments. Coupled with our patented BOTDA dark-pulse technology (the “DarkPulse Technology”), DarkPulse provides its customers a comprehensive data stream of critical metrics for assessing the health and security of their infrastructure. Our comprehensive system provides for rapid, precise analysis and responsive activities predetermined by the end-user customer.
 
Historically, distributed sensor systems have been too costly, slow and limited in their capabilities to attain widespread use. In addition, Brillouin-based sensors have been plagued with temperature and strain cross-sensitivity, i.e. the inability to distinguish between temperature and strain change along the same fiber. The loss of spatial resolution with an increase in fiber length has also limited the use of distributed sensor systems. Due to these shortcomings, existing technologies are unable to succeed within today’s dynamic environments, and needs for more advanced sensor technologies have remained unsatisfied.
 
By contrast to existing technologies, the DarkPulse Technology is a distributed-fiber sensing system, based on dark-pulse Brillouin scattering, which reports in real-time on conditions such as temperature, stress, strain and load, initially for pipeline and mining installations.
 
DarkPulse Technology’s differentiators from and advantages over existing technologies:
 

· | Real-time Reporting: Higher data acquisition speeds allowing for structural monitoring of dynamic systems
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Cost to Customer: Significantly lower acquisition and operating costs 
· | Precision: A greater magnitude of precision and spatial resolution than other systems currently available
· | Applications: Wider range of capabilities than other systems currently available 
· | Power consumption: Lower power consumption than existing systems allowing for off-grid installations 
· | Integration: Capable of integrating with existing systems 
· | Central station monitoring 

 
We believe that these key advantages should allow the Company not only to enter existing markets, but more importantly, to open new market opportunities with new applications. The Company intends to leverage new applications to target clients that have been unable to make use of distributed fiber optic technology to date.

Our Market
 
Current uses of fiber optic distributed sensor technology have been limited to quasi-static, long-term structural health monitoring due to the time required to obtain the data and its poor precision. Our DarkPulse Technology allows for the monitoring of highly dynamic environments due to its magnitude of increased resolution and greater accuracy. The resulting high speed, real-time monitoring capabilities of our DarkPulse Technology should satisfy a broad range of existing and emerging requirements. Use of the DarkPulse Technology by our customers should result in lower production costs with increased sensing capabilities that can integrate with existing technology and be upgraded cost effectively.
 
Due to the characteristics of the fiber used in fiber optic sensing, the uses of our DarkPulse Technology are wide ranging. Optical fiber is hard-wearing, which allows it to be used in environments where other technologies fail (for example, at temperatures ranging from -40°C to 300°C and 1000psi). Additionally, DarkPulse Technology’s sensors allow for live sensing due to the speed at which the analysis takes place.
 
The Company’s management team is continually identifying markets in which our DarkPulse Technology may be readily applied. Once these markets (as described below) have been addressed, our DarkPulse Technology may be adapted and applied to new markets.

Marketing
 
We utilize our DarkPulse Technology as the foundation of our ongoing marketing initiatives. Most notably, the greater magnitude of increased capabilities DarkPulse Technology versus existing bright-pulsing technologies. Existing bright-pulse Brillouin-based sensors have historically been plagued with temperature and strain cross-sensitivity, i.e. the inability to distinguish between temperature and strain change along the same fiber. The loss of spatial resolution with an increase in fiber length is also a limiting factor for the use of distributed sensor systems. Because of these shortcomings, existing bright-pulse Brillouin-based technologies are unable to succeed within today’s dynamic environments,which coincides with our DarkPulse Technology’s increased capabilities over bright-pulse systems. Our marketing initiatives include daily, broad-based social media engagement; management of our website; email campaigns, and other ongoing initiatives designed to increase awareness of our products and services and drive conversion and adoption rates.
Competition
 
The overall optical sensing market is projected to reach USD $3.47 billion by 2023 from USD $1.13 billion in 2016, at a CAGR of 15.47% between 2017 and 2023 [1]. The Company is active in the optical sensing market, including Oil & Gas pipeline health monitoring, National Border Security applications, and the mining industry. We believe that fiber sensing applications which incorporate our DarkPulse Technology may provide significant competitive advantages over structural health monitoring applications offered by the long-term leaders in the field, such as Schlumberger, Hewlett-Packard, and Yokogawa, which collectively account for a significant portion of industry sales. These companies, as well as others, have numerous differences in feature sets and functionality, but all share certain basic attributes: a bright-pulse technology as the core of their systems architecture. An architecture designed using bright-pulsing technology has limited sensing capabilities and resolutions of one meter allowing for mostly long-term quasi-static deployments.

However, the Company utilizes its DarkPulse Technology allowing for multiple applications into those markets unavailable to companies using bright-pulse technology. While many of the companies using bright-pulse technology have attempted to incorporate various sensing techniques into a legacy technology, none have been able to offer the order of magnitude resolutions offered by our DarkPulse Technology. This magnitude in resolution coupled with the DarkPulse Technology’s increased data collection speeds allows our DarkPulse Technology to be installed into areas of the market that our competitors cannot. The Company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on its ability to provide a high-quality solution as well as increased distribution of the solutions in each of the markets in which it competes or intends to compete within.
 
The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances. The Company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features, relative price and performance, product quality and reliability, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our policy is to protect our technology by, among other things, patents, trade secret protection and copyrights. We have taken security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, to the greatest extent possible. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not prove to be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours. Trade secret, patent and copyright laws afford only certain protections for our technology and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace.
 
In addition, any of our products or technology covered by patents or other intellectual property rights, could cause us to be subject to various legal actions. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims.
 
Research and Development
 
We incurred $91,301 and $33,385 of research and development expenses during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively. These funds were primarily used for development of our Erebos BOTDA hardware.
Suppliers
 
We currently rely on a full-time, dedicated, external team of experienced professionals for the coding and maintenance of our products. We believe we have mitigated the associated risks of managing an external team of software and engineering development professionals by incorporating internal management and oversight, as well as appropriate systems, protocols, controls, and procedures and ensuring that we have access to additional qualified professionals to provide like or complementary services.
Government Regulation
 
Government regulation is not of significant concern for our business nor is government regulation expected to become an impediment to the business in the near- or mid-term as management is currently unaware of any planned or anticipated government regulation that would have a material impact on our business. Our management believes it currently possesses all requisite authority to conduct our business as described in this Annual Report.
