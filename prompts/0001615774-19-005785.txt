The foregoing does not represent an exhaustive list of matters that may be covered by the forward-looking statements contained herein or risk factors that we are faced with that may cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional risks which could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, new risks regularly emerge and it is not possible for us to predict or articulate all risks we face, nor can we assess the impact of all risks on our business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K are based on information available to us on the date hereof. Except to the extent required by applicable laws or rules, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Unless the context otherwise indicates or requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “NanoVibronix,” and the “Company,” as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, refer to NanoVibronix, Inc. and its subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where otherwise stated or where it is clear that the terms mean only NanoVibronix, Inc. exclusive of its subsidiaries.


Overview
 
We were organized as a Delaware corporation in October 2003. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NanoVibronix Ltd., a private company incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel, we focus on noninvasive biological response-activating devices that target biofilm prevention, wound healing and pain therapy and can be administered at home, without the assistance of medical professionals. Our primary products, which are in various stages of clinical and market development, currently consist of:

● | UroShield™, an ultrasound-based product that is designed to prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm in urinary catheters, increase antibiotic efficacy and decrease pain and discomfort associated with urinary catheter use.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | PainShield™, a patch-based therapeutic ultrasound technology to treat pain, muscle spasm and joint contractures by delivering a localized ultrasound effect to treat pain and induce soft tissue healing in a targeted area; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | WoundShield™, a patch-based therapeutic ultrasound device intended to facilitate tissue regeneration and wound healing by using ultrasound to increase local capillary perfusion and tissue oxygenation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each of our PainShield, UroShield, and WoundShield products employs a small, disposable transducer that transmits low frequency, low intensity ultrasound acoustic waves that seek to repair and regenerate tissue, musculoskeletal and vascular structures, and decrease biofilm formation on urinary catheters and associated urinary tract infections. Through their size, effectiveness and ease of use, these products are intended to eliminate the need for technicians and medical personnel to manually administer ultrasound treatment through large transducers, thereby promoting patient independence and enabling more cost-effective home-based care.
 
PainShield is currently cleared for marketing in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration although to date there has not been a significant sales and marketing effort. All three of our products have CE Mark approval in the European Union, and a certificate allowing us to sell PainShield, UroShield and WoundShield in Israel. We are able to sell PainShield, UroShield and WoundShield in India and Ecuador based on our CE Mark. We have consummated sales of PainShield and UroShield in the relevant markets, although to date sales have been minimal; WoundShield has not generated significant revenue to date. Outside of the United States we generally apply, through our distributor, for approval in a particular country for a particular product only when we have a distributor in place with respect to such product.


In the United States, PainShield requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare practitioner. If U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance is obtained, we anticipate that WoundShield and UroShield will require a prescription from a licensed healthcare practitioner in the United States. We anticipate that UroShield will be sold directly to health care facilities and therefore will not require a prescription for these venues. However, in other countries in which we sell PainShield, UroShield, and WoundShield, such products are eligible for sale without a prescription. We are working toward a new PainShield 510(k) submission which would potentially remove the requirement for a prescription.
 
4


In addition to the need to obtain regulatory approvals, we anticipate that sales volumes and prices of our UroShield, PainShield, and WoundShield products will depend in large part on the availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement from third party payers. Third party payers include governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, private insurance plans and workers’ compensation plans. We do not currently have reimbursement codes for use of WoundShield in any of the markets in which we have regulatory authority to sell WoundShield. Of the markets in which we have regulatory authority to sell PainShield, we have reimbursement codes in the United States (i.e., CPT codes) for clinical use only, but do not have such reimbursement codes for at-home use of the product, although the product is marketed and sold for such use. With respect to UroShield, which may be used in a clinical and home setting, we do not currently have reimbursement codes in any of the markets in which we have regulatory authority to sell UroShield. We anticipate that we will begin to seek reimbursement codes for use of our products in the markets in which we have regulatory authority to sell such products; however, additional clinical data will be required in order to obtain such reimbursement codes. Our current ongoing research and planned research may facilitate our ability to obtain reimbursement codes and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining such codes quickly, or at all. We have engaged a reimbursement expert, Redemption Revenue Cycle Solutions, LLC, to help facilitate private insurance reimbursement.
 
We have completed six separate clinical studies with UroShield that together evaluated approximately 194 patients with urinary catheters. In patients where the UroShield product was used there were no serious adverse events reported, while a variety of clinical beneficial observations were seen including: catheter biofilm reduction, reduction in catheter associated pain, reduction in urinary tract infections, and a significant decrease in bacteriuria rates. We recently completed a double blind clinical trial for UroShield in the United States. The results of the study, entitled “The Effect of Surface Acoustic Waves on Bacterial Load and Preventing Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI) in Long Term Indwelling Catheters,” were published in the December 2018 issue of Medical & Surgical Urology, a peer-reviewed journal in the field of urology. In the study, 55 patients in a skilled nursing facility chain treated with long term indwelling catheters were evaluated. There was a significant difference between the treated group and the placebo group in the number of colony forming units (“CFU”) present upon evaluation, as well as on the number of treated urinary tract infections (“UTI”), and the effect lasted beyond the time of active treatment. The study concluded that the UroShield™ device was shown to be effective in significantly reducing the number of CFUs in patients with indwelling catheters. The study also concluded that the UroShield™ device was shown to be effective in reducing the number of treated UTIs in this patient population, and surface acoustic waves in the form of the UroShield™ device is an effective tool in the prevention of catheter-associated UTI and while further evaluation is encouraged, can be safely utilized with a high likelihood of success. In July 2017, we engaged Idonea Solutions, Inc., an FDA consultant, to assist in our efforts to obtain 510(K) clearance. If we are successful, we intend to pursue obtaining reimbursement codes and to target completion of partnerships with leading catheter product companies for sales and marketing efforts in the United States. The Company has entered into recent distribution partnerships for UroShield in the United States, U.K., Switzerland, Israel and India.
 
In addition, we are currently ramping up our clinical development and marketing efforts in North America with respect to PainShield. In February 2018, we completed a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of PainShield in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. The double blinded, crossover trial was conducted across the United States and included 59 patients with a diagnosis of unilateral trigeminal neuralgia. Among the 59 patients, 30 were in the active treatment group and 29 were in the control group. The values which were assessed include Visual Analog Scale (“VAS”) pain score, both baseline prior to trial and VAS pain score at the end of the study. The study also assessed breakthrough medications per week at the start of the trial and breakthrough medications per week at the end of the trial, with a particular focus on the use of opioids. Breakthrough medications are used for chronic pain directly related to the pre-existing trigeminal neuralgia condition. There was a significant difference in the outcomes of the two groups relative to pain, quality of life, and breakthrough medications taken, which was directly correlated to pain experienced during treatment. Specifically, the control group saw an improvement in baseline scores of 2.3% versus the treatment group, which saw a 55.2% improvement in baseline scores. Additionally, the control group saw a reduction in breakthrough pain medication of 1.5% versus the treatment group, which saw a 46.4% reduction in breakthrough pain medication.
 
The Company is beginning a study which is intended to assess the PainShield’s ability to effectively treat Lateral Epicondylitis (Tennis Elbow). This is a double blinded, randomized control trial. The study in ongoing, but intended to enroll 24 patients.

The Company has entered into recent distribution partnerships for PainShield in the United States, Israel, India, Italy, United Kingdom, and Switzerland.
 
WoundShield has been evaluated in two published clinical studies done to-date that suggest improved localized blood flow and oxygenation, and improved topical oxygen saturation (Morykwas M, “Oxygen Therapy with Surface Acoustic Waveform Sonication,” European Wound Management Association 2011; Covington S, “Ultrasound-Mediated Oxygen Delivery to Lower Extremity Wounds,” Wounds 2012; 24(8))). We supplied devices for these studies but had no further involvement with them. We are pursuing licensing opportunities to develop commercial markets for the WoundShield product.
 
Business Model
 
All of our products consist of a reusable controller device and a disposable component, or transducer. The controllers have a life expectancy of up to three years, while the disposable transducer has a life expectancy of up to a month and must be replaced to provide the intended therapy. The components are purchased by either the distributor or end user for use in any of the intended applications. Once the controller is purchased by the end user, recurring revenue will be realized by purchases of replacement transducers to the extent that the end user continues treatment with our product.
 
Our products are intended to be distributed both by independent distributors as well as by potential licensees. Distributor cost is discounted to account for their intended margins, based upon purchase volumes and/or periodic purchase commitments, with the disposable transducer sold and distributed in the same fashion. We currently have an established distributor network and are implementing certain criteria within such network to ensure the appropriate assignment of a distributor or licensee. We also intend to add additional distributors to our network.

 Ultrasound Technology and Our Products
 
As noted above, our primary products are based on the use of low frequency ultrasound, which delivers energy through mechanical vibrations in the form of sound waves. Ultrasound has long been used in physical therapy, physical medicine, rehabilitation and sports medicine.
 
Our proprietary technology consists of a small, thin (1 millimeter) transducer that is capable of transmitting ultrasonic acoustic waves onto treatment surfaces with a radius of up to 10 centimeters beyond the transducer. This technology allows us to treat wounds by implanting our transducers into a small, portable self-adhering acoustic patch, thereby eliminating the need for technicians and medical personnel to manually administer ultrasound therapy, which should reduce the cost of therapy. Moreover, we believe that, based upon the body of evidence, the delivery of ultrasound through our portable devices is equal to or more effective than existing competitive products, as our technology is better positioned to target the affected areas of the body.
 
While there are currently a number of products on the market that treat pain through ultrasound therapy, we believe that our products differentiate themselves because they are portable, without the requirement to be plugged into an outlet and they have a frequency of 100kHz (in contrast to other devices, which have a frequency of 1MHz), which means our products do not produce heat that can damage tissue. Our products can therefore (i) be self-administered by the patient without the need to be moved about the treated area by the patient or a clinician, (ii) be applied for a significantly longer period without the risk of tissue damage and (iii) do not require the use of gel. We are aware of one competitive product with similar ultrasound technology, the SAM® Sport4 by a company called Zetroz Systems LLC, aka ZetrOz, Inc. However, it is our belief that this product does not generate surface acoustic waves as our products do, the treatment area is generally limited to that of the transducer’s diameter, the use of transmission gel is still required and the transducer thickness is significantly greater than ours (approximately 1.5cm). To our knowledge, the device only provides a battery life of 4 hours and is continuous therapy versus intermittent therapy. We are also aware of a small clinical study, for which results were reported in August 2013, in which the SAM® Sport4 showed positive results in the treatment of venous ulcers, a type of chronic wound.
 
Research has further shown that ultrasound therapy has resulted in increased collagen repair (Da Cunha A, Parizotto NA, Vidal BC, “The effect of therapeutic ultrasound on repair of the achilles tendon (tendo calcaneus) of the rat”, Ultrasound Med. Biol. 2001 December; 27(12):1691-6), improved resolution of inflammation (Young SR, Dyson M, “Macrophage responsiveness to therapeutic ultrasound”, Ultrasound Med. Biol. 1990; 16(8):809-16) and increased tissue healing (Young SR, Dyson M, “Effect of therapeutic ultrasound on the healing of full-thickness excised skin lesions”, Ultrasonics. 1990 May; 28(3):175-80), which are all important factors in the wound healing process. Furthermore, research has shown that ultrasound therapy can contribute to increased membrane permeability (Sundaram J, Mellein BR, Mitragotri S, “An experimental and theoretical analysis of ultrasound-induced permeabilization of cell membranes,” Biophys. J. 2003 May; 84(5):3087-101) and accelerated fibrinolysis, a process that prevents blood clots from growing and becoming problematic (Harpaz D, “Ultrasound enhancement of thrombolytic therapy: observations and mechanisms”, Int. J. Cardiovasc Intervent. 2000 June; 3(2):81-89), which collectively improve the tissue regeneration process and healing of wounds. Sonophoresis, a process that increases the absorption of semisolid topical compounds, including medications, into the skin, is an additional significant effect of ultrasound therapy (Tezel A, Paliwal S, Shen Z, Mitragotri S, “Low-frequency ultrasound as a transcutaneous immunization adjuvant”, Vaccine 2005 May 31; 23(29):3800-7).
 
In general, ultrasound offers the benefits cited above by increasing local blood circulation, increasing vascular wall permeability, promoting protein secretion, promoting enzymatic reactions, accelerating nitric oxide production, promoting angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels) and promoting fibroblast proliferation (fibroblasts are a type of cell that play a critical role in wound healing). We believe that the body of evidence, and the positive therapeutic effect that ultrasound has for various indications, potentially provides for future product development opportunities for us.

We are also aware of a small clinical study, for which results were reported in August 2013, in which the SAM® Sport4 showed positive results in the treatment of venous ulcers, a type of chronic wound.

Traditional ultrasound device and our portable ultrasound patch-based device and a comparison of their energy distribution, where the X-axis represents treatment surface and the Y-axis represents ultrasound energy penetration depth within tissue.
 
In a comparison of a traditional ultrasound device and our portable ultrasound patch-based device, the bulk wave conventional ultrasound machines with handheld transducers distribute the energy deeply into the body, as shown above in diagram (A) on the left. In comparison, our device distributes the energy on the surface, as shown in diagram (B), thereby meaningfully increasing the treatment area. Our transducers may also be incorporated into treatment patches, including patches that are designed to deliver medicine and other compounds through the skin. The generation and delivery of low frequency ultrasound over a period of time to a specific area has been termed “targeted slow-release ultrasound”. We believe that this delivery method of ultrasound may be comparable to that of slow release medication in the pharmaceutical industry. This “targeted slow-release” capability is intended to allow for more frequent targeting of the intended treatment area and thus may result in a more effective therapeutic response.
 
Micro Vibrations Technology and Our Products
 
It is well established that increasing blood flow to the wound and peri-wound area helps accelerate the healing of ischemic wounds. Micro-vibrations applied on the skin tissue increase local blood flow and oxygen delivery to the wound area and stimulate angiogenesis and growth factors that are helpful for the wound healing process. Vibration therapy has been found to stimulate blood flow due to mechanical stresses of endothelial cells resulting in increased production of nitric oxide and vasodilation, as well as increase soft tissue and skin circulation. (Maloney-Hinds et al., “The Role of Nitric Oxide in Skin Blood Flow Increases due to vibration in healthy adults and adults with type 2 diabetes,” School of Medicine, Loma Linda University. Ca. Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics, 2009 p. 39-43). In addition, micro vibrations induce skin surface nerve axon reflex and type IIa muscle fibers contraction rates, resulting in vasodilation (Nakagami et al., “Effect of vibration on skin blood flow in an in vivo microcirculatory model”, The University of Tokyo, Bio-Science Trends 2007; 1 (3): 161-166). Ten minutes of vibration therapy with laser doppler revealed a consistent increase in water content of the upper dermis (TJ Ryan et al., “The effect of mechanical forces (vibration or external compression) on the dermal water content of the upper dermis and epidermis, assessed by high frequency ultrasound”, Oxford Wound Healing Institute, Journal of Tissue Viability, 2001. In another study, mean blood flow increase was higher in the vibration group than the placebo group. Improvements in local blood flow may be beneficial in the therapeutic alleviation of pain or other symptoms resulting from acute or chronic injuries (C. Button et al., “The effect of multidirectional mechanical vibration on peripheral circulation of humans”, University of Otago New Zealand, Clinical Physiology and functional Imaging, 2007 27, p211-216). A study on the effect of whole body vibration on lower extremity skin blood flow suggests, that short duration vibration alone significantly increases lower extremity skin blood flow, doubling skin blood for a minimum of 10 minutes following treatment (Lohman et al., “The effect of whole body vibration on lower extremity skin blood flow in normal subjects”, Department of Physical Therapy, Loma Linda university, USA, Med Sci Monit, 2007; 13(2) 71-76). Vibration has also been shown to stimulate angiogenesis and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (Suhr F et al., “Effects of short-term vibration and hypoxia during high intensity cycling exercise on circulating level of angiogenic regulators in humans”, J Appl Physiol, 2007, 103:474-483,. Yue Z. et al., “On the cardiovascular effects of whole-body vibration I. Longitudinal effects: hydrodynamic analysis”, Studies Appl Math, 2007, 119:95-109). Of import with respect to diabetic wounds, in which a prolonged inflammatory phase occurs, vibration vasodilation has generated an indirect anti-inflammatory action, mainly by suppression of nuclear factor-kβ, the key gene for inflammatory mediators (Sackner, M.A., “Nitric Oxide is released into circulation with whole-body, periodic acceleration”, Chest 2005;127;30-39).
 
Urinary catheter usage is associated with pain and discomfort caused by the friction between the catheter surface and the urethral tissue. Generally, this friction is treated by applying lubricating gels and low friction catheter coatings. These methods are effective for a short term during the catheter insertion as the lubricating gel is quickly absorbed into the surrounding tissue and loses its effect and the catheter coatings lose their lubricity within a few days, as the coating is covered by a thin film of mucous.
 
Our UroShield product provides vibrations along the surface of the urinary catheter that is in contact with urethral tissue. We believe that these vibrations create a continuous acoustic lubrication effect along the surface of the indwelling catheter that is in contact with the surrounding tissue, thus reducing catheter-tissue contact time, which may lessen trauma from urethra abrasion and adhesion. We have also shown in animals and in humans that the micro-vibration technology can reduce the level of biofilm formation on urinary catheters.

Our Products
 
Product Design, Packaging, Identity
 
All products have been redesigned with an updated look and improved performance. These new designs were coupled with new branding, packaging, instructional manuals, and marketing materials.
 
UroShield
 
UroShield is intended to prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation, increase antibiotic efficacy in the catheter lumen and decrease pain and discomfort associated with urinary catheter use. It is designed to be used with any type of indwelling urinary catheter regardless of the material or coating. We believe that if it is approved for marketing, UroShield could be the first medical device on the market that attempts to simultaneously address all of the aforementioned catheter-related issues. UroShield is similar in design to WoundShield and PainShield, in that it uses a driver unit that produces low frequency, low intensity ultrasound. The driver unit connects to a disposable transducer that is clipped onto the external portion of the catheter to deliver ultrasound therapy to all catheter surfaces as well as the tissue surrounding the catheter.
 

Picture of UroShield with actuator
 
We believe the UroShield system has the following advantageous effects:
 

● | Prevention or Reduction of Biofilm. The low frequency ultrasound generated by UroShield has been shown to decrease adherence of bacteria to catheter surfaces, thereby reducing biofilm. Biofilm is the complex matrix required for bacteria to grow and cause infection. See the discussion of our Heidelberg 1 trial below.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Decreased Catheter Associated Pain and Discomfort. We believe that UroShield creates an acoustic envelope on the surfaces of the catheter, which decreases friction and tissue trauma, pain and discomfort caused by the catheter. In addition, in vivo (rabbit) studies have shown the tissue in contact with the catheter remains healthier and less traumatized as a result of the application of low frequency and low intensity ultrasound (Applebaum I, et.al., “The Effect of Acoustic Energy Induced By UroShield on Foley Catheter Related Trauma and Inflammation in a Rabbit Model” Department of Urology, Shaarey Zedek Medical Center and the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical School).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acoustically Augmented Antibiotic Therapy. Antibiotic resistance in biofilm bacteria is a well-known phenomenon. Although it has been known that ultrasound can increase antibiotic efficacy in in-vitro models, we do not believe that there has been a practical ultrasound-based medical device that was able to augment antibiotic efficacy in the clinical setting. In a clinical study, UroShield technology has been shown to eradicate biofilm-residing bacteria by greater than 85% when applied simultaneously with an antibiotic in three clinically relevant species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa (Banin E, et al., “Surface acoustic waves increase the susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms to antibiotic treatment,” Biofouling, August 2011; we supplied devices for this study, but had no further involvement with it).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preservation of the Patency of Catheters. We believe that low frequency ultrasound applied to catheters will add an anti-clogging effect and will preserve patency of catheters. This effect is achieved by ultrasound waves creating an acoustic layer on the inner lumen of the urinary catheter, thereby preventing adherence of biological material and biofilm formation. We believe that this anti-clogging benefit will help prevent local infection and sepsis secondary to catheter obstruction.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
UroShield has undergone a number of clinical trials. The Heidelberg 1 trial, which we sponsored, was a 22 patient randomized, double blind, sham-controlled, independent trial that tested UroShield’s safety and ability to prevent biofilm in patients with an indwelling Foley catheter. The trial demonstrated that UroShield prevented biofilm in all patients with the active device as compared to biofilm being found in seven of eleven of the control patients. In addition, there was a marked decrease in pain, discomfort and spasm in the active UroShield patients, as evidenced by a statistically significant decrease in the requirement for the medications required to treat urinary catheter associated pain and discomfort (Ikinger U, “Biofilm Prevention by Surface Acoustic Nanowaves: A New Approach to Urinary Tract Infections?,” 25th World Congress of Endourology and SWL, Cancun, Mexico, October 2007).
 
In a subsequent physician-sponsored trial known as Heidelberg 2, 40 patients who underwent radical prostatectomies were divided into two groups, with the active group receiving one intra-operative dose of antibiotics and UroShield and the control group receiving one intra-operative dose of antibiotics and then five subsequent doses over three days. At the end of the trial, the control group had four cases of bacteriuria, as compared to one in the active group. In a third trial, a physician-sponsored open label trial, 10 patients who received emergency placement of a urinary catheter due to acute obstruction were given a UroShield device and followed with regard to their pain, discomfort, spasm and overall well-being. Within 24 hours, all patients showed improvement and increased toleration of the catheter (Zillich S., Ikinger U, “Biofilmprävention durch akustische Nanowellen: Ein neuer Aspekt bei katheterassoziierten Harnwegsinfektionen?,” Gesellschaft für Urologie, Heilbronn, Germany, May 2008). We supplied devices for this trial, but had no further involvement with it.
 
Market for UroShield
 
Approximately 25% of patients who are admitted to a hospital will have an indwelling catheter at some point during their stay and 7% of nursing home residents are managed by long term catheterization.

Catheter acquired urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most common nosocomial infection in hospitals and nursing homes, representing over 40% of all hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and 20% of intensive care unit HAIs (Maki, P and Tambyah, D. Engineering Out the Risk for Infection with Urinary Catheters., Emerging Infectious Diseases., Vol. 7, No. 2, March–April 2001). In addition, CAUTIs are the source for approximately 20% of healthcare acquired bacteremia in acute care and 50% in long-term care facilities (Nicolle, Lindsay E. “Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infections.” Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control 3 (2014). The risk of acquiring CAUTI depends on the method and duration of catheterization and patient susceptibility. Patients requiring a urinary catheter have a daily risk of approximately five percent of developing bacteriuria and approximately 25% of patients develop nosocomial bacteriuria or candiduria over one week (Maki, P and Tambyah, D. Engineering Out the Risk for Infection with Urinary Catheters., Emerging Infectious Diseases., Vol. 7, No. 2, March–April 2001). Virtually all patients requiring indwelling urinary catheters for longer than a month become bacteriuric. 
 
CAUTI occurs because urethral catheters inoculate organisms into the bladder and promote colonization by providing a surface for bacterial adhesion and causing mucosal irritation. The presence of a urinary catheter is the most important risk factor for bacteriuria. Once a catheter is placed, the daily incidence of bacteriuria is 3-10%. Between 10% and 30% of patients who undergo short-term catheterization (i.e., 2-4 days) develop bacteriuria and are asymptomatic. Between 90% and 100% of patients who undergo long-term catheterization develop bacteriuria. About 80% of nosocomial UTIs are related to urethral catheterization; only 5-10% are related to genitourinary manipulation. (John L. Brusch, Catheter-Related Urinary Tract Infection, Medscape, August 18, 2015).
 
According to a report by Zion Market Research, the global catheter market totaled approximately $26.6 billion in 2015 and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 9.7% through 2021. In the United States there are 25 million Foley catheters sold annually and there are 75 million catheters sold elsewhere yielding a total global Foley catheter market of 100 million units worldwide. The cost to treat a simple CAUTI has been estimated at $675 per case, and the cost of treating bacteremia has been estimated at $3,800 per case, yielding a total healthcare burden of $830 million per year. While there are currently both antibiotic and silver coated catheters in the market, they often sell for approximately $10 above the non-antimicrobial equivalent.
 
In addition, as of October 1, 2008, Medicare stopped authorizing its payment to hospitals in which patients have developed a catheter-associated urinary tract infection that was not present on admission. This provides hospitals in the United States with a substantial financial incentive to reduce the occurrence of such infections through the use of products such as UroShield, which help prevent infections hospitals would otherwise have to treat without reimbursement. In addition, it has been noted that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services may fine hospitals in the future when their patients develop CAUTI, which will likely increase the incentive of hospitals to invest in technologies that may prevent this complication (Brown J, et al. “Never Events: Not Every Hospital-Acquired Infection Is Preventable, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2009, 49 (5)).
 
Competition for UroShield
 
Several types of products have been introduced to address the growing problem of catheter-acquired infection and biofilm formation on catheter surfaces. Manufacturers offer antibiotic-coated and antiseptic-impregnated catheters. In addition, manufacturers have produced silver-coated catheters, which have been shown in small studies to delay bacteriuria for about two to four days. However, larger studies did not corroborate this result; on the contrary, silver hydrogel was associated with overgrowth of gram positive bacteria in the urine (Riley DK, Classen DC, “A large randomized clinical trial of a silver-impregnated urinary catheter: lack of efficacy and staphylococcal superinfection,” Am. J. Med. 1995 April; 98(4):349-56).
 
UroShield has been designed to be added to any type of catheter, including Foley catheters and silver-coated catheters, to improve a catheter’s infection prevention performance. UroShield is not intended to replace any existing products or technologies, but instead is intended to assist these existing products or technologies in preventing catheter-acquired urinary injury and catheter associated complications. UroShield may be unable to successfully compete in this market due to an inability to obtain clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and failure to be adopted by health care practitioners and facilities.

Regulatory Strategy
 
UroShield received CE Mark approval in September 2007 and was also approved for sale by the Israeli Ministry of Health in 2008. We are able to sell UroShield in India and Ecuador based on our CE Mark. UroShield was granted a Canadian medical device license in September 2016, although, due to a modification of regulatory standards in Canada, we have lost our Canadian license. We are working toward reinstatement of our Canadian license.
 
In the European Union, UroShield has been marketed for the prevention of biofilm, decreased pain and discomfort associated with urinary catheters and increased antibiotic efficacy.
 
In the United States, we intend to seek clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration through the de novo classification process for UroShield. We submitted our application for 510(k) clearance on January 3, 2011. On March 11, 2011, we received a response from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposing that the approval go through the de novo route, which will require clinical trials with proposed study protocols to be pre-cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We are currently seeking a strategic partner that is active in the urology market to coincide with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance. We have not made any further submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration related to UroShield, but we recently completed a more robust study conducted at 5 different nursing facilities in the United States. This study was approved by the institutional review board, or “IRB”. In November 2017, we announced interim results of this study.
 
NanoVibronix filed a request for a teleconference with FDA reviewers to understand the suitability of determining the medical device accessory classification via a de novo petition and to understand the expectations in order to establish safety and efficacy of UroShield. In the FDA’s written response and also during the teleconference, the FDA reviewers stated that they were particularly concerned with local tissue response (in urethra and potentially bladder) due to the extended use (up to 30 days) of a urinary catheter with UroShield attached to it. The areas of concern were primarily the physical interaction of ultrasound that is being propagated along the walls of the catheter and any leachables from the urinary catheter that would be over and above the leachables from a urinary catheter without UroShield attached to it. FDA reviewers were also concerned about the appropriateness and quality of safety test data that was previously submitted May 2012.
 
Studies being conducted to establish safety of UroShield for human use:
 
A large animal model (female sheep) study will be conducted to establish local tissue response from a urinary catheter with UroShield attached as compared to a control group of animals with a urinary catheter with no UroShield attached.
 
A comparative study of leachables from a urinary catheter with and without UroShield attached will be performed to demonstrate that the leachables with UroShield attached do not exceed toxicological safe limits allowed for a medical device.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We believe the business opportunity for UroShield is in the hundreds of millions in U.S. dollars to the extent that UroShield obtains 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is recognized as effective and becomes widely adopted for use in catheters. To that end, we are exploring sales distribution models in the United States through a distributor network and direct sales. In order to have a distribution network in place if UroShield receives clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, we are currently identifying distributors through several vehicles, including our sales staff, commissionable representation, and independent contractors. We have recently appointed distributors for UroShield in the United Kingdom and, and an outside management organization, Morulaa Health, to assist with regulatory matters and distribution of UroShield in India. Each of these distributors is paid a small retainer and will be paid a commission between 10 to 20% of sales going forward.


12


From time to time we have had interest from strategic companies in the catheter market to partner, license or acquire the UroShield technology. These strategic partners are active in the urology market and may be interested in integrating UroShield as an accessory, into its range of products. Discussions with these partners are ongoing.
 
Clinical Trials
 
To date, we have conducted the clinical trials set forth below:
 

Purpose | Doctor/Location | Time, subjects | Objectives | Results 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ikinger, Salem Academic Hospital, University of Heidelberg, Germany | 2005-2006 22 patients | To demonstrate that the use of the UroShield is safe and that the device is well tolerated by the patients and user friendly to the medical staff. Efficacy objectives were to demonstrate that the UroShield helps in prevention of biofilm formation in comparison with the urinary catheter alone, as well as bacteriuria. | UroShield was both safe and well tolerated. UroShield proved efficacious in prevention of biofilm. Subjects required significantly less medications than the control group for catheter related pain and discomfort. 
Double Blind, Comparative, Randomized Study for the Safety Evaluation of the UroShield System (HD2 ) Physician initiated | Dr. U. Ikinger, Salem Academic Hospital, University of Heidelberg, Germany | 2007 40 patients | To demonstrate that the use of the UroShield is safe and helps in prevention of biofilm formation and UTI in comparison with the urinary catheter alone, as well as decrease antibiotic use. | In this trial, only 1/20 patients in UroShield device (no antibiotics) group developed urinary tract infection compared to 4/20 patients within control group treated with the antibiotic prophylaxis alone. 
The Effect of UroShield on Pain and Discomfort in Patients Released from the Emergency Room with Urinary Catheter Due to Urine Incontinence Physician initiated | Shaare Zedek Medical Center Jerusalem, Israel. | 2007 10 patients | The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the UroShield in reducing pain and discomfort levels and improve the well-being of the subjects. Efficacy objectives included reduction of pain, spasm, burning and itching sensation levels of the subjects. | The results demonstrated a reduction in pain, itching, burning and spasm levels. Additionally, the well-being of the subjects showed a significant increase. 
The Use of the UroShield Device in Patients with Indwelling Urinary Catheters Open labeled, comparative, randomized study | Dr. Shenfeld Shaare Zedek Medical Center Jerusalem, Israel. | 2007-2009 40 patients | Patient complaints related to catheter regarding pain according to VAS scale and discomfort according to 0-10 scale Presence of Clinically Significant UTI Presence of Bacteriuria Presence of Biofilm Use of medication | UroShield device was effective in reducing postoperative catheter related pain discomfort and bladder spasms. There was also a notable trend towards reduction of bacteriuria. 
Evaluation of the UroShield in urinary and nephrostomies to reduce bacteriuria Physician initiated | Prof. P.Tenke, Hungary | 2010-2011 27 patients | ● Pain, disability and QOL ● Catheter patency ● Bacteriuria / UTI ● Hospitalization period ● Analgesics and Antibiotics intake | Showed reduction in pain and significant decrease in bacteriuria rate. 
Double Blind, Randomized Control Study for Prevention of Bacterial Colonization and UTI associated with Indwelling Urinary Catheters | Dr. Shira Markowitz Buffalo, NY | 2017 55 patients | To demonstrate the use of the UroShield reduces bacterial colonization on the urinary catheter | Final results entitled “The Effect of Surface Acoustic Waves on Bacterial Load and Preventing Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI) in Long Term Indwelling Catheters,” which was published in the December 2018 issue of Medical & Surgical Urology, a leading peer-reviewed journal in the field of urology. Mean improvement advantage in treatment vs control was 87.2K CFU, (t (53) 18.1, p<0.001) at thirty days. At 60 days the mean improvement advantage in treatment vs control was 87.5K CFU, (t (53) 18.1, p<0.001). At 90 days the mean improvement advantage in treatment vs control was 79.3K CFU, (t (53) 12.4, p<0.001). After cessation of treatment in the active group at 30 days, there was a minimal increase in CFU count at both 60 and 90 days. In the same group, there was no statistical difference in the decrease of CFU count from 30 to 60 days after treatment, t (28)=1. p= .326, however there was a marginally significant increase in CFU from 60 to 90 days for the active group (28)=1.7 p= 0.09. At baseline, every enrolled patient had been treated for infection during the 90 days prior to enrollment. Compared to baseline, the treatment group showed significant statistical and clinical improvement (100%) at 30 days relative to the sham control (73%). There were no reported infections in the Treatment Group while in the control group there were seven reported infections. At 90 days after treatment, the treatment group showed a significantly stronger improvement (89.7%) compared to the sham control (46.2%). There were three reported infection in the Treatment group, while in the control group there were fourteen reported infections requiring antimicrobial therapy. (logistic regression B=2.3, Wald Chi-Square (df=1) =10.1, p=0.001.)

Current, Ongoing and Planned Clinical Trial
 
UroShield Randomized Control trial (Completed)-A 56 patient trial was completed in January 2018, with compelling results, proving a decrease in both bacterial colonization and the incidence of Urinary Tract Infection. As issued in a press release depicting interim results, the following was noted:
 
“The trial was conducted at 5 different nursing facilities, in which 51 subjects were evaluated with 26 in the active/treatment group and 25 in the control group. All patients had been treated for at least one incident of a catheter-acquired urinary tract infection (CAUTI) requiring antibiotics in the preceding 6 months prior to trial initiation. 
 
At the 90-day evaluation, 13 of 25 subjects (52%) in the control group developed a CAUTI requiring systemic antibiotics while only 1 of 26 patients (4%) in the UroShield™ group required antibiotics. 
 
All study subjects had an initial colony count of greater than 100,000 CFU cultured from their urinary tract. At thirty days, all subjects within the control group showed no change in the number of their bacteria count which was greater than 100,000 CFU, while those in the treatment group showed a reduction to 10,000 CFU in 15 of 26 subjects and only 1,000 CFU in 10 of 26 subjects.”
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection involving any part of the urinary system, including urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidney. UTIs are the most common type of healthcare-associated infection reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Among UTIs acquired in the hospital, approximately 75% are associated with a urinary catheter, which is a tube inserted into the bladder through the urethra to drain urine. Between 15-25% of hospitalized patients receive urinary catheters during their hospital stay. The most important risk factor for developing a CAUTI is prolonged use of the urinary catheter.
 
This study was written up in the December 2018 issue of “Medical & Surgical Urology”, a leading peer-reviewed journal in the field of urology.
 
A 23 patient trial was completed recently in Norwich, United Kingdom. The trial was initiated to satisfy the requirements for adoption within the UK National Health Service. Results of the trial are not yet known.
 
An economic impact study was performed in York, United Kingdom to determine the cost savings related to prevention of urinary tract infection. The study resulted in an economic impact “model” which will demonstrate cost savings to prevention of patients contracting UTI. The trial was initiated to satisfy the requirements for adoption within the UK National Health Service.
 
An In vitro study was performed at Southampton University, Southampton, United Kingdom, to determine the effect of UroShield on bacterial colonization in a laboratory setting. The trial was initiated to satisfy the requirements for adoption within the UK National Health Service. This trial will also be helpful to fulfill a requirement of the FDA. Interim results revealed relatively positive results to all others studied in the same laboratory. Awaiting formal, final results.
 
UroShield-In vivo study is proposed by Dr. Blayne Welk MD MSc, Dr. Jeremy Burton MSc PhD-The study, entitled “Low energy surface waves to prevent urinary infections and catheter associated symptoms among patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction”. The intent is to conduct a pilot study to determine if the UroShield device can reduce catheter symptoms, improve urinary quality of life, and reduce catheter biofilm formation and bacteriuria among patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction and an indwelling catheter.

Patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction (spinal cord injury, or multiple sclerosis) have significant urinary morbidity. While intermittent catheterization is the preferred management method with there is a need to supplement bladder emptying, up to 30-50% use indwelling catheters due to their convenience and due to limitations around the performance of CIC. Urinary tract infections are common, and a defined source of mortality in this population. Patients with neurogenic bladder are unique compared to the general population in that they often have intrinsic bladder dysfunction (impaired compliance, impaired innate immunity, and neurogenic detrusor overactivity) and colonization with atypical and pathogenic bacteria. Additional urinary symptoms related to the indwelling catheter can include bladder discomfort, sediment and catheter bypassing, and systematic symptoms (autonomic dysreflexia among patients with spinal cord injury). There are limited management options for patients with indwelling catheters and bladder symptoms or frequent UTIs and there is a need for additional therapies that can mitigate these symptoms.
 
This study will be done without cost to NanoVibronix and is expected to be presented at the International Neurology Meeting in Zurich in January, or worst case, American Urologic Association in the fall.
 
If we are able to locate a strategic partner or otherwise obtain sufficient funding, we anticipate conducting the following clinical trial:
 

Trial | Place | Start Date/Timing | Objectives 
-------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UroShield U.S. Food and Drug Administration trial 80 patient trial | To be determined | To be determined | Safety and efficacy of UroShield in urinary catheter related pain and infection and biofilm formation. The results of previous clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and the results of our planned clinical trial, if we are able to locate a strategic partner or otherwise obtain sufficient funding, may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA 

 PainShield®
 
PainShield is an ultrasound device, consisting of a reusable driver unit and a disposable patch, which contains our proprietary therapeutic transducer. It delivers a localized ultrasound effect to treat pain and induce soft tissue healing in a targeted area, while keeping the level of ultrasound energy at a safe and consistent level of 0.4 watts. We believe that PainShield is the smallest and most portable therapeutic ultrasound device on the market and the only product in which the ultrasound transducer is integrated in a therapeutic disposable application patch.
 
The existing ultrasound therapy devices being used for pain reduction are primarily large devices used exclusively by clinicians in medical settings. PainShield is able to deliver ultrasound therapy without being located in a health care facility or clinic because it is portable, due to it being lightweight and battery operated. Because it is patch based and easy to apply, PainShield does not require medical personnel to apply ultrasound therapy to the patient. The patient benefits include ease of application and use, faster recovery time, high compliance, and increased safety and efficacy over existing devices that rely on higher-frequency ultrasound (Adahan M, et al, “A Sound Solution to Tendonitis: Healing Tendon Tears With a Novel Low-Intensity, Low-Frequency Surface Acoustic Ultrasound Patch,” American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Vol. 2, 685-687, July 2010). PainShield can be used by patients at home or work or in a clinical setting and can be used even while the patient is sleeping. Its range of applications includes acute and chronic pain reduction and anti-inflammatory treatment.
 

Picture of PainShield with Patch
 
PainShield is used to treat tendon disease and trigeminal neuralgia (a chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal or 5th cranial nerve, one of the most widely distributed nerves in the head); previously, the therapeutic options for these disorders have been very limited. PainShield has also been used to treat pelvic and abdominal pain. To date, to the best of our knowledge, the only treatment options for these conditions are pain medication and surgery. Several additional causes of pain, and the treatment of that pain with the PainShield product, can be explored through clinical trials.

Market for PainShield
 
Pain-related complaints are one of the most common reasons patients seek treatment from physicians (Prince V, “Pain Management in Patients with Substance-Use Disorders,” Pain Management, PSAP-VII, Chronic Illnesses). According to Landro L, “New Ways to Treat Pain: Tricking the Brain, Blocking the Nerves in Patients When all Else Has Failed,” Wall Street Journal, May 11, 2010, approximately 26% of adult Americans, or approximately 76.5 million people, suffer from chronic pain. The National Center for Health Statistics has estimated that approximately 54% of the adult population experiences musculoskeletal pain. Studies have shown that low-frequency ultrasound treatment has yielded positive results for a variety of indications, including tendon injuries and short-term pain relief (Warden SJ, “A new direction for ultrasound therapy in sports medicine,” Sports Med. 2003; 33 (2):95-107), chronic low back pain (Ansari NN, Ebadi S, Talebian S, Naghdi S, Mazaheri H, Olyaei G, Jalaie SA, “Randomized, single blind placebo controlled clinical trial on the effect of continuous ultrasound on low back pain,” Electromyogr Clin Neurophysiol. 2006 Nov; 46(6):329-36) and sinusitis (Ansari NN, Naghdi S, Farhadi M, Jalaie S, “A preliminary study into the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on chronic maxillary and frontal sinusitis,” Physiother Theory Pract. 2007 Jul-Aug; 23(4):211-8). We believe that PainShield’s technology, portability and ease of use may result in it becoming an attractive product in the pain management and therapy field.
 
Competition
 
There are numerous products and approaches currently utilized to treat chronic pain. The pharmacological approach, which may be the most common, focuses on drug-related treatments with the over-the-counter internal analgesic market estimated at $3.8 billion in 2013. Alternatively, there are a large number of non-pharmacological pain treatment options available, such as ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS, laser therapy and pulsed electromagnetic treatment. In addition, there are some technologies and devices in the market that utilize low frequency ultrasound or patch technology. Many patients are initially prescribed anti-pain medication; however, ongoing use of drugs may cause substantial side effects and lead to addiction. Therefore, patients and clinicians have shown increased interest in alternative pain therapy using medical devices that do not carry these side effects.
 
The currently available ultrasound treatments for chronic pain have generally been accepted by the medical community as standard treatment for pain management. However, the traditional ultrasound treatments, such as those manufactured or distributed by Mettler Electronics Corp, Metron USA and Zimmer MedizinSysteme, are stationary devices found only in clinics and other health care facilities that need to be administered to patients by health care professionals. We are aware of three companies that market smaller ultrasound devices capable of certain self-administered use for the treatment of pain: Koalaty Products, Inc., Sun-Rain System Corp. and PhysioTEC. These devices generally function in the same manner, at the same frequency and with the same administration and safety requirements and limitations as traditional, larger ultrasound devices. We are also aware of one product, which has recently received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval and also has CE Mark approval, marketed by ZetrOZ, Inc., that we understand may eliminate certain of these requirements and limitations, namely the requirement to be plugged in, the need for movement around the treated area and the relatively short safe treatment period. However, we understand that this product does not generate surface acoustic waves as our products do, which means that the treatment area is generally limited to that under the transducer, that the use of transmission gel is still required and that the transducer thickness is significantly greater than ours (approximately 1.5cm). It is also our understanding that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has prohibited the manufacturer from labeling or promoting this product for use directly over bone that is near the skin surface. In addition, there are other patch-based methods of pain treatment, such as TENS therapy. TENS therapy may be painful and irritating for the patient due to the muscle contractions resulting from the electrical pulses. PainShield combines the efficacy of ultrasound treatment for pain with the ease of use and portability of a patch-based system. PainShield also may be self-administered by the patient, including while the patient is sleeping. However, if we are unable to obtain widespread insurance coverage and reimbursement for PainShield, its acceptance as a pain management treatment would likely be hindered, as patients may be reluctant to pay for the product out-of-pocket.

Regulatory Strategy
 
PainShield received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in August 2008 for treatment of pain relief. PainShield received CE Mark approval in July 2008 and was also approved for sale by the Israeli Ministry of Health in 2010. We are able to sell PainShield in India and Ecuador based on our CE Mark. We are in discussions with distributors in Southeast Asia, and, if a distributor is engaged, intend to seek regulatory approvals for PainShield in Southeast Asia through such distributor.


In the United States, a prescription from a licensed healthcare practitioner is required for the use of PainShield. We have engaged a consultant to assist us in the process of reclassifying the PainShield device to remove the prescription requirement for the use of PainShield. We believe that such reclassification will open up mass market opportunities which are currently not available to us due to the prescription requirement. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to remove the prescription requirement for the use of PainShield or that, even if we accomplish such reclassification and the use of PainShield no longer requires a prescription, PainShield will be successful commercially in the mass market or we will be able to generate significant revenues from the mass market opportunities, if any.
 
In order to eliminate the requirement for a physician prescription, proof of safety and consumer “usability” must be established. With no adverse events reported on the PainShield device, we have a high degree of confidence that we will achieve the desired outcome. We have engaged User-View, Inc to facilitate our Usability study. The product packaging and all instruction documents have been modified to meet OTC standards. That study is currently in process.
 
In the United States, PainShield falls under the diathermy classification for the treatment of pain for initial reimbursement purposes. The permitted reimbursement codes can be used in the outpatient supervised medical setting. We intend to coordinate with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and private insurers so that reimbursement can be extended to cover the administration of PainShield outside of health care facilities and clinics. In addition, we intend to conduct clinical trials in order to effectively market PainShield for a larger range of indications. The targeted reimbursement would be based upon specific indications, where study data serves as justification for payment.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
PainShield was introduced in 2009 as a treatment for pain, such as tendonitis, sports injuries, pelvic pain and neurologic pain and we have sold approximately 1,700 units and 15,000 treatment patches since its introduction. We have entered into distribution agreements in United States, Europe, Asia and India for the distribution of PainShield. We intend to seek additional distribution opportunities in Europe, East Asia and Ecuador. In addition, we sell PainShield directly to patients through our website. We are currently ramping up our marketing efforts in the US market and throughout the world. We anticipate that these efforts will include recruiting additional sales personnel and representatives, making in-office calls to physicians and attending trade shows and conferences. We intend to pursue the veterinary market with our equine PainShield device.
 
We have identified a unique and effective application for PainShield, the treatment of a severe facial nerve pain called Trigeminal Neuralgia, otherwise known as tic douloureux. Two studies were performed in Israel, “a randomized control trial examining the efficacy of low intensity low frequency Surface Acoustic wave ultrasound in trigeminal neuralgia pain”, and “A sound solution for Trigeminal Neuralgia”. Two trials which enrolled a total of 16 and 15 patients respectively, both conducted at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel, concluded that this study supports the hypothesis that the application of Low Intensity Low Frequency Surface Acoustic Wave Ultrasound (LILF/SAW) may be associated with a clinically significant reduction of pain severity among patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia disease. One of the studies showed a reduction in pain among 73% of the participants. We believe this to be an ideal market to address with the PainShield. With few existing treatment alternatives, we believe the PainShield’s effectiveness is a practical and safe alternative. A broader RCT, targeting 60 patients suffering from unilateral trigeminal neuralgia, was recently completed. The article will be completed and ready for submission within 90 days.
 
GlobalData’s epidemiological analysis forecasts that the total prevalent cases of trigeminal neuralgia in the seven major markets (United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, U.K and Japan) will grow at 15% between 2012 and 2022. According to an estimate by Ronald Brisman, M.D., in 2013 the prevalence of trigeminal neuralgia in the U.S. may have been as high as approximately 280,000 patients. With the favorable results from our current, ongoing study (explained in detail below), we plan to aggressively pursue this market through direct marketing efforts and distributor relationships.
 
We have also identified a market for PainShield in the professional sports industry, where in some cases, reimbursement may be available from sports alumni organizations or, more likely, self-pay. In order to pursue this market we are exhibiting at sports trainers meetings, pursuing alumni associations, advertising in their media, and have recently engaged a national distributor in the United States. Discussions and ongoing negotiations continue with other appropriate distributors in these various market segments.

Recently Completed Research
 
A double-blind randomized control trial of a PainShield Surface Acoustic Wave Patch, the patch used in conjunction with the PainShield device, was completed in the first quarter of 2018.
 
After the enrollment and lead-in period, subjects were given a sham device to sleep with every night for a month. They were asked to fill out their pain and analgesic use logs, and undergo the bi weekly assessments. After a month they were crossed over to an active “PainShield SAW patch device” and continued to complete their pain and analgesic use logs as well as undergo biweekly assessments for months two and three of the study.
 
In the first quarter of 2019, the double blinded, crossover trial was conducted across the US and included 59 patients with a diagnosis of unilateral trigeminal neuralgia. Among the 59 patients, 30 were in the active treatment group and 29 were in the control group. The values that were assessed include Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score, both baseline prior to trial and VAS pain score at the end of the study. The study also assessed breakthrough medications per week at the start of the trial and breakthrough medications per week at the end of the trial, with a particular focus on the use of opioids. Breakthrough medications are used for chronic pain directly related to the pre-existing Trigeminal Neuralgia condition.
 
There was a significant difference in the outcomes of the two groups relative to pain, quality of life, and breakthrough medications taken, which was directly correlated to pain experienced during treatment. Specifically, the treatment group experienced a 55.2% improvement in baseline pain scores versus 2.3% for the control group. The treatment group experienced a 46.4% reduction in breakthrough pain medication versus 1.5% for the control group. In addition to measurable differences in all aforementioned measurement categories, there was a general improvement in uninterrupted sleep.

We announced interim results of a study entitled, “The Effects of the NanoVibronix’s PainShield® Surface Acoustic Waves on the Symptoms of Lateral Epicondylitis.” The clinical study was conducted by Dr. David Lemak, a leading orthopedic surgeon with Birmingham Orthopedic and Sports Specialists.
 
The trial was a randomized, double blinded study for 30 days that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of PainShield™ Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) technology on patients suffering from pain and discomfort, as well as limited mobility caused by the effects of chronic or acute lateral epicondylitis (LE) (“tennis elbow”). A total of 24 patients were enrolled, half of whom were treated with the PainShield™ device plus physical therapy and the other half were treated with a placebo device plus physical therapy. Two of the patients did not complete the trial. Patients were not allowed to use opioids during the trial, nor were they allowed to have any type of injections (cortisone or any other) at any time during the study or within the last 30 days. Patients were allowed to take standard over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen.
 
While the study is ongoing with additional patients enrolling, based on the initial results, seven out of ten patients (70.0%) who completed the study using PainShield plus physical therapy had complete resolution or significant improvement in pain. Among the placebo group plus physical therapy, five out of twelve patients (41.7%) experienced complete resolution or significant improvement in pain. Upon completion of the trial, the Company will have full results, which it expects to publish later this year.
 
WoundShield®
 
Our WoundShield product was granted the European Wound Closure Customer Value Leadership Award, Ultrasound Therapy – Wound Closure in 2014. WoundShield is intended to treat acute and chronic wounds with a disposable treatment patch that delivers localized therapeutic low frequency ultrasound. The WoundShield patch has two configurations: one that is placed adjacent to the wound and another, called the instillation patch, that is placed on the wound to enable instillation through sonophoresis, a process that increases the absorption of semisolid topical compounds, including medications, into the skin. Based on studies conducted by BIO-EC Microbiology Laboratory and Rosenblum, we believe that our WoundShield product possesses significant potential for the treatment of, among other things, diabetic foot ulcers and burns (Gasser P, Study Report delivered by BIO-EC Microbiology Laboratory, Dec 2007, which we ordered, paid for, and provided devices for; Rosenblum J, “Surface Acoustic Wave Patch Diathermy Generates Healing In Hard To Heal Wounds,” European Wound Management Association 2011, for which we supplied devices but had no further involvement).
 


Picture of WoundShield Driver and Instillation Patch
 
WoundShield delivers surface acoustic waves to the location of the wound. Surface acoustic waves move laterally across the surface of the wound, which enables the transfer of the acoustic energy of the waves along the entire wound surface in a continuous and consistent mode, providing access to the waves’ benefits for a longer treatment period than conventional ultrasound without the need for supervision or a treatment session by a clinician.

The technology has been found to have a positive effect on the epithelialization (healing by the growth of epithelial cells) of diabetic wounds, as well as on the stimulation of the precursors of dermal and epidermal (skin) growth. As such, it is a useful adjunct to wound care by increasing dermal and epidermal growth, including glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs (which bind to extracellular proteins like collagen, fibronectin, laminin, etc. and retain considerable amounts of water, thus preserving the skin structure) as well as the amount of collagen (a protein that helps skin heal) and decreasing the number of cells in mitosis (a type of cell division) (Rosenblum J, “Surface Acoustic Wave Patch Diathermy Generates Healing In Hard To Heal Wounds,” European Wound Management Association 2011, for which we supplied devices which were precursors to WoundShield, but had no further involvement). In addition, the WoundShield instillation patch allows for administration of therapeutic agents into the wound area through a sonophoresis effect.
 
Many key processes in wound healing are dependent upon an adequate supply of oxygen. Diabetic foot ulcers are particularly in need of an adequate oxygen supply because the disease often results from poor perfusion (blood flow) and decreased oxygen tension. Oxygen is also important for the immune system to combat bacteria, synthesize collagen, help with fibroblast proliferation (fibroblasts are a type of cell that play a critical role in wound healing), form oxidative (taking place in the presence of oxygen) pathways for adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, formation (ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism), and the nitric oxide dependent signaling pathways. It is generally believed that a lack of available oxygen is a basic contributing factor in the perpetuation of these wounds. Recently, wound healing experts have developed a technique of perfusing ischemic wounds (which occur when blood flow is blocked) with hyper-oxygenated saline, while the wound is being treated with ultrasound, also known as sonication. This localized oxygenation therapy has many advantages over the use of hyperbaric chambers (large chambers in which the oxygen pressure is above normal), a common method for delivering oxygen to wounds, as it is more cost-effective, can be done at the patient’s bedside and can be administered more frequently. The WoundShield instillation patch was tested as a potential ultrasound technology for this localized oxygen therapy. In one study (Morykwas M, “Oxygen Therapy with Surface Acoustic Waveform Sonication,” European Wound Management Association 2011; we supplied devices for this study, but had no further involvement with it), oxygen sensors were placed in the wound bed to directly measure partial pressure of oxygen in an ischemic wound bed on a pig. The wound was perfused with hyperbaric oxygen and sonicated using the WoundShield instillation patch. With surface acoustic wave ultrasound technology, tissue oxygen levels (partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, or PaO2) were raised from a range of 20 mmHg (millimeters of mercury) to 60 mmHg in peripheral (periwound) areas, a 3 centimeter distance away from the transducer, and from 40 mmHg to greater than 100 mmHg in the central wound bed lying below the WoundShield instillation patch (see table below). The results of this study illustrated that the WoundShield instillation patch allowed oxygen to directly enter into the wound. The direct entry of the oxygen increased the amount of oxygen reaching the wound, which has been shown to advance the healing process. In addition, we believe that WoundShield’s small size, lower cost and ease of use makes localized oxygen treatment commercially viable.

In 2012, results were published of a human feasibility trial for the WoundShield instillation patch that was performed at Duke University in North Carolina. Seven patients were treated with the WoundShield instillation patch for their wounds and average tissue oxygen levels (PaO2) increased by an average of 58% over baseline (Covington S, “Ultrasound-Mediated Oxygen Delivery to Lower Extremity Wounds,” Wounds 2012; 24(8)). We supplied devices for this trial, but had no further involvement with it.
 
Market for Wound-Healing Devices
 
The global wound care device market totaled approximately $24 billion in 2015 and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.7% during 2016-2022 (as reported by P&S Global Research in January 2017). According to the Global Report on Diabetes produced by the World Health Organization in 2016, globally, an estimated 422 million adults were living with diabetes in 2014, compared to 108 million in 1980. According to a report entitled “Advances in Wound Closure Technology” by Frost and Sullivan (2005), foot complexities are the most frequent causes for patients with diabetes to get hospitalized, with complications usually starting with the formation of skin ulcers. In addition, according to the American Burn Association, approximately 486,000 patients received medical treatment annually for burn injuries in 2016 in the United States. There are also policy-based factors that may increase the size of the wound care market. We anticipate that reimbursement decisions with respect to hospital acquired wounds may create a large market opportunity for wound care products, including WoundShield. Furthermore, in 2009, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that they would stop reimbursements for treatment of certain complications that they believed were preventable with proper care. One such complication was surgical site infections after certain elective procedures, including some orthopedic surgeries and bariatric surgery. We believe that such developments incentivize medical care providers to invest in reducing the risk of infection through the use of wound care products, including WoundShield.
 
Competition for WoundShield
 
The market for advanced wound care includes a number of competitors, such as Kinetic Concepts, Inc., or KCI, Smith and Nephew plc and Convatec Inc., all of whom market wound-healing medical devices. Due to their size, in general these companies may have significant advantages over us. These competitors have their own distribution networks for their products, which gives them an advantage over us in reaching potential customers. In addition, they are vertically-integrated, which may allow them to maximize efficiencies that we cannot achieve with our third-party suppliers and distributors. Finally, because of their significantly greater resources, they could potentially choose to focus on research and development of technology similar to ours, more than we are able to. In general, we believe that these competitors have, and will continue to have, substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, regulatory and clinical, manufacturing, marketing and sales, distribution and personnel resources than we do. However, we believe that our products differentiate us from these competitors, and we will be competitive on the basis of our technology. We believe that the strength of these competitors may create an opportunity through strategic partnerships.
 
At present, ultrasound treatment for wounds is limited only to wound debridement (removal of damaged tissue or foreign objects from a wound) and such products are marketed by Arobella Medical, LLC, which produces the Qoustic Wound Therapy System, Misonix Inc., which produces SonicOne products, and Alliqua Biomedical, Inc., which produces the MIST Therapy System. Due to their size, in general these companies may have the same advantages over us as discussed with respect to our competitors in the paragraph above. However, these ultrasound devices are indicated for use only in medical clinics and require an operator to deliver their treatment, thus limiting their use and application. The MIST Therapy System and Quostic Therapy System are a non-contact ultrasound device that delivers ultrasound through a mist that is applied directly on the wound.
 
We believe that these therapies are less advantageous than WoundShield because they require an operator to deliver the treatment and the removal of bandages to target the wound bed. In contrast, the WoundShield patch sits on normal skin bordering the open wound and no manipulation of the wound bandage is required. Moreover, WoundShield can be self-administered, without an operator, in both clinics and home settings. We also believe that WoundShield will prove to be an effective alternative to treating chronic wounds at a lower price than the existing products being used by medical practitioners. As such, we believe that facilities that are reimbursed based upon diagnosis-related groups will be more inclined to adopt WoundShield because it will provide the same therapeutic results at a significantly lower cost than traditional ultrasound therapies.
 
21


We are also aware of a small clinical study, for which results were reported in August 2013, in which a small ultrasound device showed positive results in the treatment of venous ulcers, a type of chronic wound. Based upon currently available information about this device, we believe it will be at least 2018 before this device is available on the market for treatment of venous ulcers. We understand that this product does not generate surface acoustic waves as our products do, which means that the treatment area is generally limited to that of the transducer’s diameter. We believe our products would have certain other advantages over this potential device, if developed, including that our products weigh less and are thinner. However, given the early stage of development of this potential device, we cannot say with certainty how our products would compare.
 
The most common method of oxygen administration for wound healing is hyperbaric oxygen therapy, especially to treat specific ulcerations in diabetic patients. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been shown to increase vascular endothelial growth factor expression, which measures the creation of new blood vessels (Fok TC, at el, “Hyperbaric oxygen results in increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expression in rabbit calvarial critical-sized defects”, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, Canada). The activation of endothelial cells by VEGF sets in motion a series of steps toward the creation of new blood vessels (J Lewis et al, National Cancer Institute, Understanding Cancer and Related Topics, Understanding Angiogenesis). We believe that the WoundShield instillation patch, which can be used as an oxygen instillation system, will be complementary to, or in some cases an alternative, to the use of hyperbaric chamber therapy. This complementary treatment option will allow the treating physician greater therapeutic versatility in treating wounds. For a certain populace of patients, we believe that the WoundShield instillation patch could provide physicians with an alternative to hyperbaric oxygen therapy because it provides the same benefits as hyperbaric oxygen therapy at a lower cost to the patient. There are a number of competitors in the hyperbaric chamber therapy market, including approximately eight companies in the United States. Due to their size, in general these companies may have the same advantages over us discussed with respect to our competitors in the first paragraph of this section. However, we believe that the WoundShield instillation patch possesses certain advantages over the existing hyperbaric chamber therapy, including lower cost and greater ease of use. In addition, we do not believe that the WoundShield instillation patch will necessarily compete with hyperbaric chamber therapy, but rather will often complement such therapy.
 
While we believe that WoundShield is well positioned to capture a share of the wound care market, WoundShield may be unable to achieve its anticipated place in the wound care market due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, an inability to obtain the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for which it is indicated and its failure to be adopted by health care practitioners and facilities or patients because of its status as a new product in a market that relies on patient-focused initiative to treat wounds.
 
Regulatory Strategy
 
For a general discussion of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process with respect to our products, and regulation of our products in general, see “– Government Regulation” below.
 
Our general regulatory strategy for WoundShield is focused on seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for a variety of indications. WoundShield obtained CE Mark approval in November 2012.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
WoundShield has generated minimal revenues to date. We intend to market WoundShield in Europe and pursue the necessary approvals to commence marketing in the United States and Canada. Our strategy for selling WoundShield in the United States is to find a strategic partner in the wound care market. We are actively pursuing this strategy. WoundShield could be an effective adjunct to existing wound treatment devices or a stand-alone wound treatment modality.

Clinical Trials
 
With respect to WoundShield, to date, we have conducted the following evaluation studies:
 

Purpose | Doctor/Location | Time, subjects | Objectives | Results 
--------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Covington | 2010 7 patients | The study aimed to determine if hyper oxygenated saline delivered by surface acoustic waves improves tissue oxygenation in lower extremity wounds. | Surface acoustic wave technology in conjunction with oxygenated saline can increase interstitial oxygen in wound bed. This trial to validate proof of concept was put on hold due to financial constraints. The duration of the trial was two weeks. 

Third Party Reimbursement
 
NanoVibronix has entered into an agreement with Redemption Revenue Cycle Solutions LLC, beginning on January 1, 2019. RRCS has an expertise in establishing reimbursement at a reasonable rate, and facilitating the billing for both NanoVibronix and its distributors.
 
We anticipate that sales volumes and prices of the products we commercialize will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payers. Third party payers include governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and workers’ compensation plans, among others. These third party payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for a product or therapy, in whole or in part, if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. The third party payers also may place limitations on the types of physicians or clinicians that can perform specific types of procedures. In addition, third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Some third party payers must also pre-approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the products or therapies. Even though a new product may have been approved or cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until adequate reimbursement has been obtained from governmental and private third party payers.
 
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines and procedures. There can be no assurance that procedures using our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third party payers, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 
In the United States, some insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs are paying their providers on a per capita basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month, and consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use certain products, including ours.
 
One of the components in the reimbursement decision by most private insurers and governmental payers, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers Medicare, is the assignment of a billing code. Billing codes are used to identify the procedures performed when providers submit claims to third party payers for reimbursement for medical services. They also generally form the basis for payment amounts.
 
23


Obtaining reimbursement approval for a product from any government or other third party payer is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us or our distributors to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product to each payer. Even if a code is obtained for a product, a third party payer must still make coverage and payment determinations. When a payer determines that a product that is eligible for reimbursement, the payer may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities. We believe that the overall escalating costs of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the health care industry to reduce the costs of products and services. In addition, recent health care reform measures, as well as legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels, create significant additional uncertainties. There can be no assurance that third party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third party payers will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third party payer coverage or reimbursement would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
UroShield. We expect these products to be used in inpatient settings and therefore reimbursed under the DRG or per diem reimbursement system. In addition, in an outpatient or home setting, we anticipate that these products will initially be purchased privately until a reimbursement code is obtained. However, we believe that if we can empirically demonstrate UroShield’s efficacy in preventing recurrent hospitals admission in chronic Foley catheter patients and reducing overall per-patient cost, third party payers may accelerate the reimbursement approval process since the device could reduce their overall per-patient cost. We believe the natural progression of the adoption of this technology will allow for use in the home setting. We intend pursue reimbursement in the Medicare Part B code to support the use for long term catheter use and infection prevention in the home.
 
PainShield. Although it is a minimal amount, PainShield is presently reimbursed in the United States by many private insurers under the national umbrella for diathermy service, CPT code 97024, for use of the ultrasound device in a supervised medical setting and is reimbursed in 15-minute increments for up to an hour a day, 5 hours a week and 20 hours a month. The current reimbursement mechanism is inadequate to support the end user or distributor cost of the device. If the device is efficacious in the treatment of the patient’s condition, the treatment period can be extended in some cases for months. Presently, when used in an outpatient setting, such as by a clinic, PainShield is typically purchased by the clinic that then can bill the existing reimbursement codes. PainShield is not currently reimbursed for therapy in the home setting. When we have sufficient funding, we intend to work to obtain reimbursement in the home setting as well as codes that would allow for reimbursement for use of the non-disposable and disposable components of the PainShield device. Our anticipated clinical trials for PainShield would support this effort. In the United States, PainShield requires a prescription from a physician.
 
WoundShield. We believe that the initial usage of these products will be in the hospital setting. Reimbursement in the hospital setting is typically governed by the Diagnosis Related Group system, or DRG system, which is a prospective payment methodology that assigns a predetermined, fixed amount based on the patient’s diagnoses. In parallel to introducing these devices to hospitals, we intend to apply for reimbursement codes for outpatient use. Although obtaining these codes can take years and may require extensive clinical data, we believe that the desirable characteristics of these products may serve as an incentive to insurance companies to grant these codes more quickly.
 
New Products Under Development
 
Renooskin
 
In 2016, we started developing a device for the facial rejuvenation market called Renooskin. Previous in vitro studies on human skin were done showing that the SAW technology provided skin rejuvenation comparable to Retinol A which is a well-accepted anti-aging cream. We have developed a head band like applicator for the PainShield SAW treatment and are in the process of arranging for a pilot trial with a cosmetic dermatologist and/or plastic surgeon. We believe that, subject to proof of efficacy of the Renooskin and receiving regulatory approval, the device can be sold in a non-reimbursement market since cosmetic devices are private pay. The product is pending evaluation and we are considering several paths towards commercialization.
 
24


LungShield
 
A pilot study, adapting the UroShield technology to endotracheal tubes, is currently underway at Shaare Zedek Medical Center. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a device which generates low energy ultrasound waves like the UroShield product. The endpoint of the study is to show its effect on development of bacterial colonies on endotracheal tubes, in patient receiving mechanical ventilation, and to determine whether this effect lowers the rate of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Results of this study are not known at this time, and is still ongoing.
 
Research and Development Expenses
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we spent approximately $614,000 and $693,000, respectively, on research and development activities. None of the cost of such activities is borne directly by our customers.
Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
We have rights to six patents in the United States. Granted U.S. Patent No. 7,393,501 (having the following foreign counter-parts: China ZL03818327.7; Israel 165422; Japan 4504183; India 246351; Australia 2003231892; European Union 1511414 B), “Method, apparatus and system for treating biofilms associated with catheters” and granted U.S. Patent No. 7,829,029 (having the following foreign counter-parts: China ZL200780019732.3 and European Union 1998834), “Acoustic add-on device for biofilm prevention in urinary catheter,” both relate to the use of surface acoustic waves to prevent biofilm formation on indwelling catheters. These granted U.S. patents expire on December 19, 2023 and October 27, 2025, respectively. Granted U.S Patent No. 9,028,748, “System and method for surface acoustic wave treatment of medical devices,” relate to methods of generating surface acoustic waves on medical device surfaces on both indwelling medical devices and implants to prevent biofilm formation This U.S. patent expires on July 11, 2030. Granted U.S. Patent No. 9,585,977 (having the following foreign counter-parts: China ZL200780014875.5, European Union, and allowed Israel application), “System and method for surface acoustic waves treatment of skin,” relates to methods of using surface acoustic waves for treatment of skin for the purpose of wound-healing, reducing infection, pain reduction and cosmetic enhancements. This U.S. patent expires August 20, 2033.
 
We also license two in-force patents pursuant to a license agreement with Piezo-Top Ltd and PMG Medica Ltd., U.S. Patent No. 6,454,716 B1, “System and method for detection of fetal heartbeat,” and U.S. Patent No. 6,964,640 B2, “System and method for detection of motion,” which incorporate certain technology related to detecting in-vivo motion relating to biological parameters such as, for example, blood flow detection, heartbeat monitoring, fetal motion monitoring, fetal heartbeat monitoring, etc.. The configuration allows for an optimal scanning range at an unlimited number of angles. These patents expire on May 23, 2020 and January 22, 2023, respectively.
 
We believe the granted patents, patent applications and license agreement (described below) collectively cover our existing products to the extent necessary, and may be useful for protecting our future technology developments. We intend to continue patenting new technology as it is developed, and to actively pursue any infringement of any of our patents.
 
To date, we are not aware of other companies that have patent rights to a comparable system and method for surface acoustic wave treatment for skin.
 
Trademarks
 
We believe that our product brand names are an important factor in establishing and maintaining brand recognition. We have the following trademark registrations in the United States: NanoVibronix®, WoundShield®, PainShield®, and UroShield®. We intend to re-file and pursue our previously acquired trademark registration “Curing though prevention”®, which expired in July 2015. Generally, the protection afforded for trademarks is perpetual, if they are renewed on a timely basis, if registered, and continue to be used properly as trademarks.

Government Regulation
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation
 
Each of our products must be approved, cleared by, or registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before it is marketed in the United States. Before and after approval or clearance in the United States, our products, approved or cleared products and product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, record-keeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceutical products. PainShield has already obtained 510(k) marketing approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approval or Clearance of Medical Devices
 
In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy:

● | Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations, and a pre-market notification (510(k)) unless exempt; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class II: special controls, pre-market notification (510(k)) unless exempt, specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries and post-market surveillance and additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class III: special controls and approval of a Pre-Market Approval, or PMA, application. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
WoundShield and PainShield are classified as Class II medical devices and require U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorization prior to marketing, by means of 510(k) clearance, except for our UroShield product, which we intend to seek clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration through the de novo classification process, described below.
 
To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than a legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information and the results of performance testing. In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence only when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. The typical duration to receive 510(k) approval is approximately nine months from the date of the initial 510(k) submission, although there is no guaranty that the timing will not be longer.
 
26


The U.S. Food and Drug Administration may require us to perform clinical studies to show a product candidate’s safety and efficacy in addition to technological equivalence in support of our filed 510(k). No matter which regulatory pathway we may take in the future towards marketing products in the United States, we believe we will be required to provide clinical proof of device effectiveness and safety.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or that would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, would require a PMA. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determines that the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, then a company must submit and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration must approve a PMA before marketing can begin.
 
A PMA application must provide a demonstration of safety and effectiveness, which generally requires extensive nonclinical and clinical trial data. Information about the device and its components, device design, manufacturing and labeling, among other information, must also be included in the PMA. As part of the PMA review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with quality system regulation requirements, which govern testing, control, documentation and other aspects of quality assurance with respect to manufacturing. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determines the application or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. During the review period, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians and statisticians, is likely to be convened to review the application and recommend to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is not bound by the advisory panel decision. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration often follows the panel’s recommendation, there have been instances where the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finds the information satisfactory, it will approve the PMA. The PMA approval can include post-approval conditions, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, or requirements to do additional clinical studies post-approval. Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required to authorize certain modifications to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA. The typical duration to receive PMA approval is approximately two years from the date of submission of the initial PMA application, although there is no guarantee that the timing will not be longer.
 
As described above, we anticipate that our UroShield product will receive a de novo review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. De novo review is a two-step process that requires a company to submit a 510(k) and complete a standard review, including an analysis of the risk to the patient and operator associated with the use of the device and the substantial equivalence rationale. Once that has been accomplished, and the medical device in question has been determined to be not substantially equivalent to another approved device, the product is automatically classified as a Class III device. The manufacturer can then submit a request for an evaluation to have the product reclassified from Class III into Class I or Class II. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will review the device classification proposal and either recommend special controls to create a new Class I or II device classification or determine that the product is a Class III device. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determines that the level of risk associated with the use of the device is appropriate for a Class II or Class I designation, then the product can be cleared as a 510(k) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will issue a new classification regulation and product code. If the device is not approved through de novo review, then it must go through the standard PMA process for Class III devices.

One or more clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and more recently are becoming necessary to support a 510(k) submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an investigational device exemption application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prior to initiation of the clinical study. An investigational device exemption application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device on humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The investigational device exemption will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration unless the U.S. Food and Drug Administration notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an institutional review board has approved the study.

During the study, the sponsor must comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s investigational device exemption requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. The sponsor, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the institutional review board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application.
 
Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices
 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | the U.S. Food and Drug Administration quality systems regulation, which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test, manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of certain adverse experiences associated with use of the product. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good Manufacturing Practices Requirements
 
Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with the good manufacturing practices set forth in the quality system regulations promulgated under section 520 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as further set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations as 21 CFR Part 820. Current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facility for an approved product must meet current good manufacturing practices requirements to the satisfaction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pursuant to a pre-PMA approval inspection before the facility can be used. Manufacturers, including third party contract manufacturers, are also subject to periodic inspections by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other authorities to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer, and possibly us, to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in product withdrawal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval.
International Regulation
 
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements.
 
28


The primary regulatory environment in Europe is the European Union, which consists of 25 member states and 42 competent authorities encompassing most of the major countries in Europe. In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency and the European Union Commission determined that PainShield, UroShield, and WoundShield are to be regulated as medical device products. These products are classified as Class II devices. These devices are CE Marked and as such can be marketed and distributed within the European Economic Area. We are required to be recertified each year for CE by Intertek, which conducts an annual audit. The audit procedure, which includes on-site visits at our facility, requires us to provide Intertek with information and documentation concerning our management system and all applicable documents, policies, procedures, manuals, and other information.
 
The primary regulatory bodies and paths in Asia, Australia, and Latin America are determined by the requisite country authority. In most cases, establishment registration and device licensing are applied for at the applicable Ministry of Health through a local intermediary. The requirements placed on the manufacturer are typically the same as those contained in ISO 9001 or ISO 13485, requirements for quality management systems published by the International Organization of Standardization. In some countries outside Europe, we are or will be able to sell on the basis of our CE Mark. We have the Health for PainShield, WoundShield and UroShield, a certificate by the Israel Ministry of Health allowing us to sell PainShield, WoundShield and UroShield in Israel, a certificate allowing us to sell PainShield in Australia, and we are able to sell PainShield, WoundShield and UroShield in India and Ecuador based on our CE Mark. In addition, our distributor in Korea has applied for approval to sell PainShield and UroShield. We generally apply, through our distributor, for approval in a particular country for a particular product only when we have a distributor in place with respect to such product.


European Good Manufacturing Practices
 
In the European Union, the manufacture of medical devices is subject to good manufacturing practice, as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines of the European Union and its member states. Compliance with good manufacturing practice is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. Typically, quality system evaluation is performed by a notified body, which also recommends to the relevant competent authority for the European Community CE Marking of a device. The competent authority may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each device manufacturing facility must be audited on a periodic basis by the notified body. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product.
U.S. Fraud and Abuse and Other Health Care Laws
 
In the United States, federal and state fraud and abuse laws prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of health care products and services. Other provisions of federal and state laws prohibit presenting, or causing to be presented, to third party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. In addition, other health care laws and regulations may apply, such as transparency and reporting requirements, and privacy and security requirements. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as medical devices, such as us, and hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products. The health care laws that may be applicable to our business or operations include:
 
● The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for, or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services payable by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal health care program.
 
29


● Federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other government health care programs that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
 
● The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program, and for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
 
● HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations, which also impose obligations and requirements on health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform certain services for them that involve the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, with respect to safeguarding the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information.
 
● The federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
● Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to referrals and items or services reimbursed by both governmental and non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal law, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Customers
 
We currently sell our products both through our website and distribution agreements, with approximately 55% of our sales coming through distributors in 2018. We expect that percentage to grow significantly as we enter into additional distribution agreements. We have exclusive and non-exclusive distribution agreements for our products with medical product distributors based in the United States, various countries throughout Europe, India, and Asia.


We are currently in discussions with a number of distribution companies in the United States, Europe, and Asia, as well as a distributor which will allow access into Veterans Administration facilities. Our current agreements stipulate that distributors will be responsible for carrying out local marketing activities and sales. We are responsible for training, providing marketing guidance, marketing materials, and technical guidance. In addition, in most cases, all sales costs, including sales representatives, incentive programs, and marketing trials, will be borne by the distributor. We expect any future distribution agreements to contain substantially similar stipulations. Under our current agreements, distributors purchase our products from us at a fixed price. Our current agreements with distributors are generally for a term of approximately two to three years and automatically renew for an additional annual terms unless modified by either party.

Recent Developments
 
In January, 2019, we began collaborating with the Fritz Clinic, which has been at the forefront of tackling the opioid epidemic. As a leader in the field of opioid addiction, the Company supports Dr. Fritz’ approach in aiding patients with opioid dependence and providing them with alternative treatments to address the underlying cause of pain, rather than simply masking it with pain killers.
 
In February, 2019, we announced the publication of an independent study entitled, “The Effect of a Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Device on the Symptomatology of Trigeminal Neuralgia,” which was published in the January 2019 issue of Journal of Anesthesiology and Pain Research, a leading peer-reviewed journal in the field of anesthesiology. The double blinded, crossover trial was conducted across the U.S. and included 59 patients with a diagnosis of Unilateral Trigeminal Neuralgia.
 
There was a significant difference in the outcomes of the two groups relative to pain, quality of life, and breakthrough medications taken, which was directly correlated to pain experienced during treatment. Specifically, the treatment group experienced a 55.2% improvement in baseline pain scores versus 2.3% for the control group. The treatment group experienced a 46.4% reduction in breakthrough pain medication versus 1.5% for the control group. In addition to measurable differences in all aforementioned measurement categories, there was a general improvement in uninterrupted sleep.
 
In March, 2019, the Company announced results of a study entitled, “The Effects of the NanoVibronix’s PainShield® Surface Acoustic Waves on the Symptoms of Lateral Epicondylitis” ( Tennis Elbow). While the study is ongoing with additional patients enrolling, based on the initial results, seven out of ten patients (70.0%) who completed the study using PainShield plus physical therapy had complete resolution or significant improvement in pain. Among the placebo group plus physical therapy, five out of twelve patients (41.7%) experienced complete resolution or significant improvement in pain. Upon completion of the trial, the Company will have full results, which it expects to publish later this year
