Overview
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a pipeline of novel, proprietary therapeutics that have the potential to transform radiotherapy in cancer. We leverage our expertise in superoxide dismutase mimetics to design drugs to reduce normal tissue toxicity from radiotherapy and to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. Avasopasem manganese (avasopasem, or GC4419) is a highly selective small molecule dismutase mimetic in development for the reduction of severe oral mucositis, or SOM, in patients with head and neck cancer, or HNC, and for the reduction of esophagitis in patients with lung cancer. We are also exploring the potential for avasopasem to reduce cisplatin-induced kidney damage. SOM is a common, debilitating complication of radiotherapy in patients with HNC. In February 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to avasopasem for the reduction of SOM induced by radiotherapy. In February 2023, the FDA accepted and granted Priority Review designation to our New Drug Application, or NDA, for avasopasem for this indication. Our second dismutase mimetic product candidate, rucosopasem manganese (rucosopasem, or GC4711), is in clinical-stage development to augment the anti-cancer efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRT, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and locally advanced pancreatic cancer, or LAPC.
 Radiotherapy-induced SOM can lead to devastating complications for patients. A majority will suffer severe pain which is often managed with the use of opioids. Patients with SOM are at risk of dehydration and malnutrition as a result of the inability to eat or drink, and often require nutrition through an intravenous line or surgical placement of a feeding tube. Each year in the United States, approximately 67,000 patients are diagnosed with HNC, according to the American Cancer Society. In the five largest European markets, approximately 68,000 patients are diagnosed annually with HNC, and an additional 23,000 in Japan. We estimate that approximately 65% of patients diagnosed with HNC will be treated with radiotherapy. All patients with HNC treated with radiotherapy are at risk for developing SOM, which suggests a target patient population of approximately 43,500 patients in the United States alone for our lead indication. We believe that SOM in patients with HNC represents a total market opportunity of more than $1.5 billion in the United States based on branded supportive care price analogs. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs for SOM in these patients and we believe avasopasem, which to date is not approved for any indication, has the potential to become the standard of care for the reduction of SOM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy.
 In December 2021, we announced topline efficacy results from a Phase 3 trial of avasopasem for the reduction of radiotherapy-induced SOM in patients with locally advanced HNC, which we refer to as the Reduction in Oral Mucositis with Avasopasem Manganese, or ROMAN, trial. The results demonstrated efficacy across multiple SOM endpoints with a statistically significant reduction on the primary endpoint of reduction in the incidence of SOM and a statistically significant reduction on the secondary endpoint of number of days of SOM, with a median of 18 days in the placebo arm versus 8 days in the avasopasem arm. We had previously announced topline results from the ROMAN trial in October 2021 that incorrectly stated the reduction on the primary endpoint was not statistically significant. Upon further analysis, an error by the contract research organization was identified in the statistical program. Correction of this error yielded the correct, statistically significant p-values for the primary and a key secondary endpoint. Exploratory analyses, such as time to SOM onset and SOM incidence at various landmarks of radiotherapy delivered, further demonstrated clinical efficacy of avasopasem in reducing the burden of SOM. Avasopasem appeared to be generally well tolerated compared to placebo.
In October 2022, we announced the presentation of the one-year tumor and renal function outcomes data from the ROMAN trial as well as topline results from a recently completed meta-analysis of the ROMAN and GT-201 (Phase 2b) SOM trial results at the 2022 American Society for Radiation Oncology, or ASTRO, Annual Meeting. After one-year follow-up, patients with HNC treated with avasopasem in combination with the standard-of-care regimen (intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or IMRT, plus cisplatin) demonstrated comparable tumor outcomes and overall survival to patients in the placebo arm, showing that avasopasem protected HNC patients from SOM without affecting the treatment benefit of standard-of-care chemoradiotherapy. In addition, after one year of follow-up, patients treated with avasopasem in combination with IMRT plus cisplatin had a 10% incidence of

chronic kidney disease, or CKD, compared to 20% of patients in the placebo arm, which was a pre-defined exploratory endpoint evaluating renal function. CKD (eGFR <60) is a known toxicity risk with cisplatin, which can have significant long-term consequences. The prospective exploration of this potential benefit of avasopasem was driven by published preclinical data and a post hoc assessment of patients from the GT-201 trial presented at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, Annual Meeting. We believe these CKD data suggest another potential benefit of avasopasem for these patients beyond reducing SOM. In addition to the ROMAN long-term endpoints, a meta-analysis of the Company’s two randomized placebo-controlled trials (ROMAN and GT-201; n=551) was included in the ASTRO presentation; these results reinforced that across both trials avasopasem therapy resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in radiotherapy-induced SOM, including reductions in the incidence, number of days, severity, and delay in the onset of SOM compared to placebo.
 In December 2022, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for avasopasem for the reduction of radiotherapy-induced SOM in patients with HNC undergoing standard-of-care treatment. The NDA is supported by the data from the two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials (ROMAN and GT-201), as well as data from other clinical trials of avasopasem in the proposed indication. In February 2023, the FDA accepted the NDA for filing and granted priority review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target date of August 9, 2023. The FDA indicated in its acceptance of filing letter that it is not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting on the application.
 In December 2021, we also announced topline results from a Phase 2a multi-center trial in Europe assessing the safety and efficacy of avasopasem in patients with HNC undergoing standard-of-care radiotherapy, which we refer to as the EUSOM trial. Avasopasem appeared to be generally well tolerated, and the incidence of SOM and median number of days of SOM observed in the EUSOM trial were in line with the ROMAN trial results. We plan to meet with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in 2023 to discuss the potential registration pathway in Europe for avasopasem for radiotherapy-induced SOM.
 In May 2022, we announced topline results from an open-label, single-arm Phase 2a trial evaluating avasopasem for its ability to reduce the incidence of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis in patients with lung cancer, which we refer to as the AESOP trial. This multi-center trial enrolled 39 patients (62 screened) of which 35 completed treatment with 60 gray of radiotherapy plus chemotherapy over six weeks. Of these 35 patients, 29 received at least five weeks of 90 mg of avasopasem on the days they underwent radiotherapy. These 29 patients were evaluated as the pre-specified per protocol population. The results demonstrated that avasopasem substantially reduced the incidence of severe esophagitis in patients with lung cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy compared to expectations based on review of historical data in the literature. Avasopasem was generally well tolerated. The adverse events experienced are comparable to those expected with chemoradiotherapy.
 There are currently no FDA-approved drugs and no established guidelines for the treatment of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis. We intend to pursue a strategy for avasopasem, if approved for reduction in the incidence of SOM, that involves presenting the AESOP clinical data to entities like the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, to support the use of avasopasem to reduce esophagitis as a medically accepted indication in published drug compendia, notwithstanding that this indication may not be approved by the FDA.
 In addition to developing avasopasem for the reduction of normal tissue toxicity from radiotherapy, we are developing our second dismutase mimetic product candidate, rucosopasem, to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of higher daily doses of radiotherapy, or SBRT. SBRT typically involves a patient receiving one to five large doses of radiotherapy, in contrast to the 30 to 35 small daily doses typical of intensity modulated radiation therapy, or IMRT. Clinically, SBRT is increasingly used in patients with certain tumors, such as LAPC and NSCLC, that are less responsive to the small daily doses typical of IMRT. Even with the use of SBRT, there is need for improvement in treatment outcomes for certain tumors. In September 2021, in support of rucosopasem, we announced final results from our pilot Phase 1/2 safety and anti-cancer efficacy trial of avasopasem in combination with SBRT in patients with unresectable or borderline resectable LAPC. In this proof-of-concept trial, improvements were observed with avasopasem plus SBRT in overall survival, progression-free survival, local tumor control and time to distant metastases relative to patients treated with placebo plus SBRT.
We used our observations from the pilot LAPC trial to inform the design of our rucosopasem clinical trials in combination with SBRT. We have successfully completed Phase 1 trials of intravenous rucosopasem in healthy volunteers and initiated a Phase 1/2 trial in patients with NSCLC in October 2020, which we refer to as the

GRECO-1 trial, and in May 2021, initiated a Phase 2b trial in patients with LAPC, which we refer to as the GRECO-2 trial.
 The GRECO-1 trial is supported in part by a Small Business Innovation Research grant from the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for the investigation of our dismutase mimetics in combination with SBRT for the treatment of lung cancer. We intend for this trial to assess the anti-cancer efficacy and safety of rucosopasem in combination with SBRT. In June 2022, we reported interim results from the open-label Phase 1 stage of the trial with six months follow-up on all seven patients. Rucosopasem in combination with SBRT appeared to be well tolerated through the cutoff date of June 14, 2022. The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, cough, and nausea, which are common in patients with lung cancer receiving radiotherapy. Through six months, in-field partial responses were observed in three patients and stable disease was observed in three others based on RECIST criteria. These results included target tumor reductions in five patients of 61%, 58%, 33%, 29% and 27% and one patient with an 8% increase. Preservation of pulmonary lung function was also observed compared to our expectations based on review of historical literature evaluating pulmonary function in a similar patient population with SBRT alone. We expect to complete enrollment in the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 stage of this trial in the second half of 2023.
 The GRECO-2 trial is designed to assess rucosopasem in combination with SBRT in patients with LAPC, based on our observations from the pilot LAPC trial with avasopasem. The primary endpoint of this trial is overall survival. We expect to complete enrollment in the GRECO-2 trial in the second half of 2023.
 Our management team has extensive drug development and commercialization experience ranging from discovery through registrational trials and commercial launch.

The following table summarizes our product candidates:


Our Strategy
Our mission is to transform cancer therapy by reducing normal tissue toxicity induced by radiotherapy and increasing the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy with the use of our dismutase mimetics. By doing this we seek to improve the lives of patients with cancer. Key elements of our strategy are as follows:
•Complete development and obtain FDA approval of avasopasem for the reduction of radiotherapy-induced toxicities. Avasopasem has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the reduction of SOM induced by radiotherapy. Avasopasem has achieved statistical significance and demonstrated improved clinical benefit in reducing SOM in our 


ROMAN and GT-201 trials. We submitted an NDA to the FDA in December 2022 and the application was granted priority review with a PDUFA target date of August 9, 2023. We also evaluated avasopasem in a Phase 2a trial to reduce the incidence of esophagitis in patients receiving radiotherapy for lung cancer, and we may initiate additional clinical trials for avasopasem to reduce radiotherapy-induced toxicities in other cancer indications. We intend to pursue a strategy for avasopasem, if approved for reduction in the incidence of SOM, that involves presenting clinical data to entities like the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, to support the use of avasopasem to reduce esophagitis and/or other radiotherapy-induced toxicities as medically accepted indications in published drug compendia, notwithstanding that these indications may not be approved by the FDA.
 •Build a commercial infrastructure in the United States. We intend to commercialize avasopasem, if approved, by building a specialized sales and marketing organization in the United States focused on radiation oncologists. We believe a scientifically oriented, customer-focused team of approximately 40 sales representatives would allow us to effectively reach the concentrated prescribing base of approximately 5,000 radiation oncologists in the United States, who we believe are among the physicians most likely to use avasopasem. We also expect to leverage this sales organization to commercialize rucosopasem, if approved, and any of our future product candidates in the United States. We may seek to establish collaborations for the commercialization of avasopasem, rucosopasem, and our other product candidates in the United States and other regions such as Europe and Asia. 
 •Advance the development of rucosopasem in combination with SBRT to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. Based on extensive preclinical research results with avasopasem and rucosopasem and positive data from our pilot LAPC trial, we believe that rucosopasem has the potential to increase the anti-cancer efficacy and safety profile of SBRT. We successfully completed Phase 1 trials with rucosopasem in healthy volunteers and initiated a Phase 1/2 trial with rucosopasem in combination with SBRT in patients with NSCLC in October 2020 and initiated a Phase 2b trial with rucosopasem in combination with SBRT in patients with LAPC in May 2021. We expect to complete enrollment in both trials in the second half of 2023. We may seek new applications for our dismutase mimetics for other cancer therapy indications.
 •Develop additional novel dismutase mimetics, formulations, and applications. We intend to leverage our expertise in superoxide dismutase mimetics to continue to develop novel compounds that are intended to reduce normal tissue toxicity from radiotherapy and increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. Additionally, we believe we can broaden the utility of our novel dismutase mimetics by formulating them for oral delivery or other routes of administration. We have evaluated alternative formulations of rucosopasem and other novel compounds in our portfolio and will consider them for potential development. In addition, we intend to seek new applications for our dismutase mimetics, including other potential combinations in cancer therapy, such as with cisplatin for the reduction of the cisplatin-induced kidney damage. 
 •Seek strategic collaborative relationships. We intend to seek strategic collaborations to facilitate the capital-efficient development and commercialization of our dismutase mimetics. We believe these collaborations could potentially provide significant funding to advance our dismutase mimetics candidate pipeline while allowing us to benefit from the development and commercial expertise of our collaborators. 
 Background on Superoxide and Superoxide Dismutase
Superoxide is similar to the molecular oxygen, O2, that is essential to breathing and life, except it carries one more electron. This extra electron, shown in the chemical formula O2-, makes superoxide a reactive oxygen species that can react with a variety of biological molecules. Superoxide is produced constantly in every living cell by normal activities such as mitochondrial respiration, and if not removed rapidly, it causes damage to lipids, proteins, DNA and other critical biological molecules. As a result, it can harm or kill cells and has been implicated in a variety of biological disorders, including cancer. As protection, human cells produce superoxide

dismutase enzymes, or SODs, to eliminate superoxide by rapidly and selectively converting it to hydrogen peroxide at rates of 107 molecules per second or higher. Hydrogen peroxide is much less toxic than superoxide to normal cells and is subsequently broken down by various enzymes, such as catalase (the natural disposal enzyme for hydrogen peroxide), to molecular oxygen and water. The SOD pathway is depicted below.



Radiotherapy induces bursts of superoxide in the irradiated tissues well in excess of normal amounts, which can overwhelm native SOD activity. It generates superoxide directly, by splitting water molecules immediately, and indirectly, by activating enzymes that produce large amounts of superoxide following radiation. In addition, once tissue damage has begun, inflammatory cells attracted to the irradiated region also produce superoxide prodigiously. The resulting high levels of superoxide can induce significant damage in normal cells, and, depending on which organs fall within the irradiated field, can drive a variety of normal tissue toxicities. A condition referred to as mucositis occurs when the cells lining the gastro-intestinal tract, known as the mucosa, are damaged or killed.
Scientific literature suggests that metabolic differences make cancer cells much less sensitive than normal cells to elevated superoxide; elevated superoxide levels may even be typical of some cancers. As a result, the removal of the excess superoxide generated by radiotherapy does not decrease the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. Meanwhile, scientific literature also suggests that cancer cells are much more sensitive than normal cells to elevated hydrogen peroxide, so the conversion of excess superoxide to hydrogen peroxide by SODs may contribute to the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy.
Artificially increasing SOD levels, by gene overexpression or administering recombinant SOD enzyme, has been shown in third-party preclinical and clinical studies to reduce radiotherapy-induced normal tissue toxicities, including mucositis. The preclinical studies have also suggested that increasing SOD levels can increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. Current therapeutic applications of the SODs themselves, however, have been limited by their following characteristics:
•large size and inability to enter cells and mitochondria, where superoxide is predominantly produced; 
 •immunogenicity, particularly when derived from non-human sources; 
 •short half-lives in circulation; and 
 •inactivation or inhibition by various reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide. 
 Our Superoxide Dismutase Mimetics
We believe low molecular weight drugs that can mimic native SODs can overcome the limitations of using the native enzymes therapeutically. The challenge has been finding small molecule dismutase mimetics with similarly fast catalytic rates and high selectivity for superoxide that are also stable, safe and suitable for manufacturing. We are developing our dismutase mimetics to address this challenge.

Our class of dismutase mimetics are based on a common core structure, where a macrocyclic ring positions five nitrogen atoms to tightly hold a manganese atom in the ring’s center. These pentaaza macrocycles are manufactured with the manganese in the +2 oxidation state, or Mn+2. In solution, this Mn+2 reacts rapidly with the protonated form of superoxide, which has the chemical formula HO2 and is constantly in equilibrium with regular superoxide. In this reaction, Mn+2 gives up an electron and is oxidized to Mn+3, making hydrogen peroxide. Then, as quickly as superoxide can reach the Mn+3, it takes superoxide’s extra electron, reducing back to Mn+2, making molecular oxygen and bringing the dismutase mimetic full circle back to where it started.
Our Dismutase Mimetics Core Structure:
Pentaaza Macrocycles



We have designed, and are developing, our dismutase mimetics to have each of the following essential features:
•Speed. Our dismutase mimetics catalyze the conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen at a rapid rate of 2 × 107 molecules per second or more, comparable to native SODs. Their structures hold the manganese such that it can rapidly shift back and forth between Mn+2 and Mn+3, meaning that their catalytic rate, or the speed that they convert superoxide, is mostly dependent on how fast superoxide can get to the manganese. 
 •Selectivity. Our dismutase mimetics are designed to interact only with superoxide. Central to this selectivity are three key attributes: (1) the Mn+2 will not react with reducing agents; (2) oxidizing Mn+2 requires a powerful oxidizing agent, so it will not react with nitric oxide and molecular oxygen; and (3) the Mn+2 oxidizes rapidly via a single-electron pathway, excluding many other biologically relevant reactive oxygen species, including peroxynitrite, hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide, that operate as two-electron oxidizing agents. 
 •Stability. Our dismutase mimetics hold on tightly to the manganese at the center of the macrocyclic ring, allowing them to maintain their functionality as dismutase mimetics while they remain in the body. 
 •Safety. We have observed our dismutase mimetics to be well-tolerated in our preclinical studies and clinical trials in patients. 
 •Synthesis. We have developed an efficient and cost-effective manufacturing process. 
 In radiotherapy, we believe our dismutase mimetics have the potential to reduce normal tissue toxicity by removing excessive superoxide. We have demonstrated this in preclinical models not only of mucositis, but also radiotherapy damage to the lungs, liver and other organs. Importantly, our dismutase mimetics do not interfere with the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy, as demonstrated in preclinical tumor models and in our placebo-controlled SOM trials in patients with HNC.
There is also the potential to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of SBRT, where our dismutase mimetics generate high daily doses of hydrogen peroxide. Preclinically, we have shown this effect in a variety of cancer types, including head and neck, pancreatic, lung and breast cancer, and when SBRT is combined with immune checkpoint
6


inhibitor therapy. Given the combination of reduced normal tissue toxicity and increased anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy, we believe that our dismutase mimetics can transform radiotherapy.
In chemotherapy, we further believe our dismutase mimetics have the potential to reduce normal tissue toxicity by removing excessive superoxide produced by some commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. We have demonstrated this in preclinical models of cisplatin damage to the kidneys. Importantly, our dismutase mimetics do not interfere with the anti-cancer efficacy of cisplatin and other commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, as demonstrated in preclinical tumor models.
We currently have two dismutase mimetic candidates in clinical development, avasopasem and rucosopasem. We also believe the technology is amenable to development of additional candidates for intravenous or other routes of administration.
Disease Overview and Our Product Pipeline
 Reducing Radiotherapy-Induced Toxicities in Patients with Cancer (Radioprotection)
 The American Cancer Society estimates approximately two million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the United States in 2023 and over 50% of patients with cancer will be treated with radiotherapy at some time in their treatment cycle. While radiotherapy has variable success depending on the cancer being treated, the toxicity or side effects associated with its use can limit its effectiveness. Radiotherapy causes acute and late toxicities that affect various organs and functions.
One of the most common radiotherapy-induced toxicities results in a condition referred to as mucositis which occurs when cells lining the gastro-intestinal tract, known as the mucosa, are damaged or killed. The oral mucosa is a common location for mucositis to occur, particularly for patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy. Another common location for mucositis to occur in patients receiving radiotherapy is the esophagus, referred to as esophagitis.
Oral Mucositis
OM occurs when radiotherapy induces the production of superoxide that attacks and breaks down the epithelial cells lining the mouth. The severity of OM is commonly measured using the WHO scale, which is also used by the FDA as a basis for product approvals. The scale consists of five Grades: Grade 0 through Grade 4. SOM is commonly defined as Grade 3 or Grade 4 OM.

Grade | WHO Scale Description 
 | No OM 
 | Erythema (redness) and soreness 
 | Erythema and ulcers but patients can swallow solid food 
 | Ulcers with extensive erythema and patients cannot swallow solid food
 | Oral alimentation (solid or liquid) is not possible 

 
SOM can lead to devastating complications, including:
•Pain. A majority of patients experience severe pain, often requiring opioids to manage the pain. A publication describing 191 patients being treated for HNC noted that of the 157 patients reporting the greatest amount of mouth and throat soreness, 70% were taking opioids to alleviate their pain. 
 •Dehydration and malnutrition. Approximately 70% of patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy become unable to eat, drink, or both, often requiring nutrition through a gastrostomy tube or intravenous line. 
 •Treatment interruption. SOM can be dose-limiting, requiring a reduction or delay in radiotherapy, leading to poorer clinical outcomes. Approximately 11% of patients experience 


unplanned breaks of a week or more in radiotherapy, with each week of treatment delay decreasing tumor control by over 10%.
•Increased economic burden. Approximately 16% of patients receiving radiotherapy for HNC are hospitalized due to SOM. Based on a third-party analysis of medical insurance claims covering 40 million patient years, patients with HNC and treated with radiotherapy who developed OM incurred, on average, approximately $40,000 in additional medical expenses in the first six months from the start of radiotherapy compared to such patients who did not develop OM. 
 Each year in the United States, approximately 67,000 patients are diagnosed with HNC, according to the American Cancer Society and we estimate that approximately 65% will be treated with standard-of-care radiotherapy. All patients with HNC treated with radiotherapy are at risk for developing SOM, which suggests a target patient population of approximately 43,500 patients in the United States alone for our lead indication. Based on observations from multiple studies, we estimate that approximately 70% will develop SOM and between 20% to 30% will develop Grade 4 OM.
 In the five largest European markets, approximately 68,000 patients are diagnosed annually with HNC, and an additional 23,000 in Japan.
In a survey we conducted in 2018 of 150 U.S. radiation oncologists, OM was identified as the most burdensome side effect caused by radiotherapy in patients being treated for HNC. In a survey we conducted in 2022 of 100 U.S. radiation oncologists and 100 U.S. medical oncologists, SOM was considered to cause a major impact to patients and their care, with the condition leading to increased treatment delays, treatment discontinuations, and hospitalizations.
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations
There are currently no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of OM in patients with HNC. In 2020, the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society of Oral Oncology, or MASCC / ISOO, published an update to the leading clinical practice guidelines for the management of OM. These guidelines, which are summarized below, underscore how limited the existing approaches are for the management of OM in patients with HNC, and that these approaches have been largely palliative to date.
•Basic oral care. The guidelines suggest the use of basic oral care protocols to prevent OM across all cancer modalities; however, the guidelines indicate the clinical evidence is weak in supporting the effectiveness of this approach. 
 •Anti-inflammatory agents. The guidelines recommend the use of benzydamine mouthwash to prevent OM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy doses up to 50 gray without concomitant chemotherapy and suggest the use of benzydamine for patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy with chemotherapy. 
 •Antimicrobials, coating agents, anesthetics, and analgesics. The guidelines suggest the use of 0.2% morphine mouthwash to treat pain associated with OM in patients with HNC. 
 •Laser and other light therapy. The guidelines recommend the use of low-level laser therapy to prevent OM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy. However, some evidence suggests that low-level laser therapy may have long-term carcinogenic effects, so MASCC / ISOO advises the clinician to inform patients about the expected benefits and potential risks of this therapy. 
 •Cryotherapy. The guidelines recommend the use of 30 minutes of oral cryotherapy to prevent OM in certain cancer patients, not including those receiving radiotherapy for HNC. 
 •Natural and other miscellaneous agents. The guidelines suggest oral glutamine to prevent OM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy. The suggestion is made with caution because of the 


higher mortality rate seen in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who receive parenteral glutamine. The guidelines also suggest the use of honey to prevent OM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy.
These MASCC / ISOO guidelines demonstrate that there is a high unmet need for the treatment or prevention of OM in patients with HNC, driven by the lack of clear efficacy of the existing treatment options. This unmet need is further demonstrated by the findings from our 2018 survey of 150 U.S. radiation oncologists, where only 19% and 21% of physicians, respectively, stated that topical agents are effective in preventing or reducing the incidence of SOM and in treating or reducing the duration of SOM in patients with HNC. Our 2022 survey reinforced that the majority of radiation and medical oncologists are not satisfied with current options available to treat SOM and that there is a high unmet need for the treatment or prevention of OM. The FDA has also acknowledged this unmet need and the lack of effective therapies for the reduction of the duration, incidence and severity of SOM induced by radiotherapy by granting avasopasem Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and priority review for the NDA. We believe that SOM in patients with HNC represents a total market opportunity of more than $1.5 billion in the United States.
 Our Solution: Avasopasem for Radiotherapy-Induced Severe Oral Mucositis
Avasopasem is a highly selective small molecule dismutase mimetic we are developing for the reduction of SOM in patients with HNC. We believe avasopasem, which to date is not approved for any indication, has the potential to address shortcomings associated with current approaches and become the standard of care treatment for SOM in patients with locally advanced HNC.
Potential Benefits of Avasopasem for Severe Oral Mucositis
We believe that avasopasem has the potential to be the first FDA-approved drug and the standard of care for the reduction of SOM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy, with the following benefits:
•Mechanism of action designed to address the root cause of OM: Unlike existing treatment options that are largely symptomatic and reactive in nature, we believe avasopasem has the potential to address and mitigate the root cause of OM. Avasopasem is designed to rapidly convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, reducing mucosal damage and thereby the incidence and severity of mucositis. 
 •Compelling clinical data from two positive, randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trials: Results from our ROMAN and GT-201 trials demonstrate the potential benefits of avasopasem across multiple parameters of SOM. Avasopasem has received Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA. 
 •Maintenance of anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy: One-year and two-year follow-up clinical data from our ROMAN trial and GT-201 trial, respectively, for avasopasem in patients with locally advanced HNC showed similar rates of tumor control and survival between avasopasem and placebo with no observed decrease in the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. We believe this is significant as maintenance of anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy is of key importance to physicians when considering new drugs to manage side effects of radiotherapy. Two-year follow-up for overall survival from our ROMAN trial is ongoing.
 •Higher patient adherence: The intravenous formulation of avasopasem, administered in a clinical setting by a health care provider, promotes higher patient adherence, optimizing clinical outcomes. 
 Our market research surveys conducted with radiation and medical oncologists suggest avasopasem has a clinically meaningful product profile based on the safety and efficacy data from our two randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trials. Respondents in the various rounds of market research conducted between 2018 and 2022 projected the use of avasopasem in a range of 48% to 69% of their eligible patients, with a majority of physicians suggesting they would adopt avasopasem within the first 12 months of it becoming available.

Clinical Development of Avasopasem for Severe Oral Mucositis
 New Drug Application (NDA)
 Avasopasem has been granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the reduction of SOM induced by radiotherapy. As a benefit of such designations, we had multiple interactions with the FDA in preparation for the submission of the NDA. Based on these interactions, it was determined that our two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials are sufficient for review of the NDA, and that the FDA would review an Integrated Summary of Efficacy based on a meta-analysis of the integrated ROMAN and GT-201 trial results.
 In December 2022, we submitted the NDA to the FDA. The NDA is supported by the data from the two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials (ROMAN and GT-201), as well as data from other clinical trials of avasopasem in the proposed indication.
In February 2023, the FDA accepted the NDA for filing and granted Priority Review designation with a PDUFA target date of August 9, 2023. The FDA indicated in its acceptance of filing letter that it is not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting on the application. 
ROMAN Trial (Phase 3)
 In December 2021, we announced positive topline efficacy results from the ROMAN trial. We had previously announced topline results from the ROMAN trial in October 2021. Upon further analysis following the October topline data announcement, an error by the contract research organization was identified in the statistical program. Correction of this error yielded the correct, statistically significant p-values for the primary and a key secondary endpoint. The trial was a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial assessing the effects of avasopasem on the incidence, duration and severity of SOM. 455 patients were enrolled in the trial and randomized 3:2 in favor of the avasopasem 90 mg treatment arm. Like our Phase 1b/2a and GT-201 trials, the eligible population was patients with locally advanced, squamous cell HNC who were eligible for seven weeks of standard-of-care radiotherapy.

The primary endpoint of the ROMAN trial was the reduction in the incidence of SOM through the radiotherapy period for patients being treated with 90 mg of avasopasem as compared to placebo received as a 60-minute intravenous infusion less than 60 minutes before radiation, Monday to Friday, for seven weeks. All patients were assessed twice weekly for OM by trained evaluators during the course of their radiotherapy treatment.
Additional endpoints included, among others, reduction in the number of days of SOM experienced by all patients and reduction in the severity of SOM, as well as the effect of treatment on tumor outcomes measured by overall survival, or OS, progression-free survival, or PFS, locoregional control, or LRC, and distant metastasis-free,

or DMF, rates. Adverse events were monitored during the trial period. One-year tumor outcomes and two-year survival rates will be collected.
 In this trial, avasopasem demonstrated efficacy across SOM endpoints with a statistically significant 16% relative reduction on the primary endpoint of reduction in the incidence of SOM (p=0.045) and a statistically significant 56% relative reduction in the number of days of SOM (p=0.002), with a median of 18 days in the placebo arm versus 8 days in the avasopasem arm. The severity of SOM (incidence of Grade 4 OM) was reduced by 27% in the avasopasem arm compared to placebo (p=0.052).
 Relative Reduction Across SOM Endpoints

Exploratory analyses, such as time to SOM onset and SOM incidence at various landmarks of radiotherapy delivered, also demonstrated clinical efficacy of avasopasem in reducing the burden of SOM. The median time to onset of SOM for all patients was delayed by 11 days, from 38 days in the placebo arm to 49 days in the avasopasem arm. The incidence of SOM at all radiotherapy landmarks for patients on avasopasem was reduced compared to placebo, with the relative reductions greater than the primary endpoint both earlier during the course of therapy and during the two-week observation period after radiotherapy, as summarized in the following chart. The gray, or Gy, is the International System of Units unit of absorbed radiation dose.


Incidence of SOM Reduced at All Landmarks of Radiation Therapy

We believe the data in the above chart further demonstrate the potential clinical activity of avasopasem and the potential benefit to patients over the course of their radiotherapy.
 In addition, after one year of post treatment follow-up, patients treated with avasopasem in combination with IMRT plus cisplatin had a 10% incidence of chronic kidney disease, or CKD, which was a pre-defined exploratory endpoint evaluating renal function, compared to 20% of patients in the placebo arm (p=0.0043). CKD (eGFR <60) is a known toxicity risk with cisplatin, which can have significant long-term consequences. The prospective exploration of this potential benefit of avasopasem was driven by published preclinical data and a post hoc assessment of patients from the GT-201 trial presented at the 2020 ASCO Annual Meeting. We believe this CKD data suggest another potential benefit of avasopasem for these patients beyond reducing SOM.
 We also followed patients from this trial for tumor outcomes out to one year following radiotherapy and continue to follow patients out to two years for overall survival. In the one-year assessment of tumor outcomes, we observed similar outcomes among patients in the avasopasem and placebo arms in OS, PFS, LRC and DMF rates, demonstrating that avasopasem protected HNC patients from SOM without affecting the treatment benefit of standard-of-care chemoradiotherapy.
 

Tumor Outcomes Maintained through One Year
 


Avasopasem appeared to be generally well tolerated compared to placebo. No difference was observed in the severity of adverse events and the most frequent adverse events were similar between the treatment and placebo arms. The percentages of patients with the most common adverse events in the ROMAN trial are shown in the table below.

GT-201 Trial (Phase 2b) in Patients with HNC
In December 2017, we announced positive topline data from the GT-201 trial in 223 patients with locally advanced HNC being treated with IMRT and concurrent cisplatin at multiple sites in the United States and Canada. The trial was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial assessing the effects of avasopasem on the median duration, incidence and severity of SOM. Patients received 30 mg of avasopasem, 90 mg of avasopasem or placebo as a 60-minute infusion less than 60 minutes before radiation, Monday to Friday, for seven weeks. All patients were assessed twice weekly for OM by trained evaluators during the course of their radiotherapy treatment. If SOM was present in a patient at the end of the course of his or her radiotherapy treatment, that patient continued to be evaluated weekly for up to eight additional weeks.
GT-201 Trial Design (n=223)
 


The primary endpoints of the trial were reduction in the duration of SOM in the 90 mg and 30 mg treatment arms. Duration was defined as the number of days from when a patient was first assessed with SOM until the first day that patient was assessed with Grade 2 or less OM, with no subsequent occurrences of SOM.
In this trial, the 90 mg treatment arm of avasopasem demonstrated a statistically significant reduction compared to placebo on the primary endpoint (p=0.024). The median duration of SOM in this arm was 1.5 days, a 92% reduction compared to placebo.
Secondary endpoints included reduction in the incidence and severity of SOM in each of the 90 mg and 30 mg treatment arms. For these purposes, we define the severity of SOM as the incidence of Grade 4 OM. The incidence of SOM in the 90 mg treatment arm was reduced by 36% through 60 Gy and 34% through the full course of radiotherapy treatment compared to placebo and the severity of SOM in the 90 mg treatment arm was reduced by 47% through the full course of radiotherapy treatment compared to placebo.
 In the 30 mg treatment arm, intermediate reductions compared to placebo were observed in median duration of SOM (58%), incidence of SOM through 60 Gy (31%) and through the full course of radiotherapy treatment (8%), and in severity of SOM (30%) through the full course of radiotherapy treatment.
Relative Reduction Across SOM Endpoints


In the trial, we also observed an apparent delay in the onset of SOM in the 90 mg treatment arm compared to placebo, reduced usage of opioids in both the 30 mg and 90 mg treatment arms compared to placebo, and reduced placement and use of gastrostomy tubes in the 90 mg treatment arm compared to placebo.
The following chart depicts the course of SOM in each patient in the 90 mg treatment arm or the placebo arm who experienced at least one episode of SOM during the course of his or her treatment and follow-up. Each bar represents a single patient and illustrates the length of time between that patient’s first evaluated instance of SOM and his or her last evaluated instance of SOM, along with the severity of his or her SOM during that interval.



This chart demonstrates that (1) fewer patients in the 90 mg treatment arm developed SOM than in the placebo arm, (2) fewer patients in the 90 mg treatment arm developed Grade 4 OM than in the placebo arm, and (3)

on average, SOM did not last as long for patients in the 90 mg treatment arm. This is consistent with the observed reductions in the individual numerical endpoints of median duration, incidence and severity.
We followed patients from this trial for tumor outcomes out to two years following radiotherapy. In the two-year assessment of tumor outcomes, we observed similar outcomes among the three arms in OS, PFS, LRC and DMF rates.
Tumor Outcomes Maintained through Two Years



No difference was observed in the severity of adverse events among the three arms in the trial and the most frequent adverse events were similar among the three arms.

Meta-Analysis of Integrated ROMAN and GT-201 Trials
 In October 2022, we announced the presentation of a meta-analysis of our two randomized placebo-controlled trials (ROMAN and GT-201; n=551) at the 2022 ASTRO Annual Meeting. These results reinforced that across both trials avasopasem therapy resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in radiotherapy-induced SOM, including reductions in the incidence, number of days, severity, and delay in the onset of SOM compared to placebo.
 
Reduction Across SOM Endpoints in Meta-Analysis


Phase 2a Trial in Patients with HNC in Europe (EUSOM)
 In December 2021, we announced topline results from EUSOM, a Phase 2a multi-center trial of avasopasem in Europe evaluating avasopasem in combination with IMRT and concurrent cisplatin in patients with locally advanced HNC. This trial was conducted in twelve centers across six countries in Europe and enrolled 38 patients, of which 33 completed full treatment.


The primary objective of this trial was to assess the safety of avasopasem in combination with IMRT and concurrent cisplatin. Secondary objectives included, among others, the reduction in the incidence of SOM through the radiotherapy period.
Avasopasem appeared to be generally well tolerated. The incidence of SOM was 54.5% and the median number of days of SOM was 9 days for patients who completed treatment in the EUSOM trial, in line with the ROMAN trial, in which the incidence of SOM in the avasopasem arm was 54% and the median number of days of SOM was 8 days.

Phase 1b/2a Trial in Patients with HNC
In August 2016, we completed a Phase 1b/2a, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation trial of the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of avasopasem in combination with radiotherapy and concurrent cisplatin in 46 patients with locally advanced HNC. Doses ranged from 15 mg to 112 mg. The objectives of this trial were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of avasopasem in combination with IMRT and cisplatin, to determine a maximum tolerated dose and to assess the potential of avasopasem to reduce the duration, incidence and severity of SOM.
In this trial, patients were assigned to treatment duration groups based upon the dose and duration of dosing of avasopasem received and we observed that the incidence, duration, and severity of SOM through six weeks of radiotherapy (with patients receiving a cumulative radiotherapy dose of 60 Gy) decreased for patients who received six to seven weeks of avasopasem. In the group receiving six to seven weeks of avasopasem, 29% of patients experienced SOM, with a median duration of 2.5 days, and no patients experienced Grade 4 OM. Avasopasem was well tolerated and a maximum tolerated dose was not reached.
Patients in the trial were followed for tumor outcomes at one-year post-radiotherapy. The observed LRC, DMF, PFS, and OS rates in 44 patients evaluable for tumor outcome at one year were 93%, 93%, 84% and 93%, respectively. We believe these outcomes are similar to the outcomes observed in historical control studies, suggesting that avasopasem does not decrease the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy.
 Radiotherapy-Induced Esophagitis
Radiotherapy-induced esophagitis is a common and debilitating adverse effect that develops in patients receiving radiotherapy, most commonly for lung, esophageal, breast or head and neck cancers or for lymphoma. Radiotherapy-induced esophagitis is inflammation, edema, erythema, and erosion of the mucosal surface of the esophagus caused by radiotherapy. Esophagitis can be life-threatening, and symptoms include an inability to swallow, severe pain, ulceration, infection, bleeding and weight loss and may require hospitalization. The severity of esophagitis is graded using the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, which is a five-point grading scale:


Grade | Description 
 | Patients are asymptomatic with only clinical observations 
 | Patients are symptomatic with altered eating or swallowing, with oral supplements indicated 
 | Patients exhibit severely altered eating or swallowing requiring tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition or hospitalization
 | Patient requires urgent operative intervention; condition is life-threatening 
 | Results in death 

 
Radiotherapy-induced esophagitis potentially represents a larger market opportunity than OM. In lung cancer (our first target market for esophagitis), there are approximately 238,000 new patients annually in the United States, of which approximately 50,000 are treated with radiotherapy. The overall frequency of Grade 2 or higher esophagitis in patients receiving radiotherapy for the treatment of lung cancer is approximately 50% and approximately 20-30% will experience Grade 3 or higher. The results of our 2018 survey of 150 U.S. radiation oncologists suggested that they view OM data as being representative of potential efficacy in esophagitis, which we believe supports the feasibility of exploring the use of avasopasem for the reduction of esophagitis.

Current Treatment Landscape and its Limitations
There are currently no FDA-approved drugs and no established guidelines for the treatment of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis. Treatment options are not only ineffective but also largely symptomatic in nature, with medications being administered in conjunction with a focus on adequate hydration and nutrition. These approaches, which include various analgesics such as topical lidocaine and opioids, and tube or intravenous feeding, do not treat the underlying cause of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis.
Our Solution: Avasopasem for Radiotherapy-Induced Esophagitis
Unlike existing treatment options that are largely palliative in nature, we believe avasopasem has the potential to address and mitigate the root cause of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis. By removing superoxide, avasopasem is designed to reduce the damage radiotherapy ordinarily causes to the patient’s esophageal mucosa, and thereby reduce the incidence of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis. We believe avasopasem has the potential to become the standard of care for the reduction in the incidence of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis in patients with lung cancer.
Clinical Development of Avasopasem for Esophagitis

Phase 2a Trial in Patients with Lung Cancer (AESOP Trial)
 
In May 2022, we announced topline results from an open-label, single-arm Phase 2a trial evaluating avasopasem for its potential to reduce the incidence of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis in patients with lung cancer, which we refer to as the AESOP trial. This multi-center trial enrolled 39 patients (62 screened) of which 35 completed treatment with 60 Gy of radiotherapy plus chemotherapy over six weeks. Of these 35 patients, 29 received at least five weeks of 90 mg of avasopasem on the days they underwent radiotherapy. These 29 patients were evaluated as the pre-specified per protocol population. The results demonstrated that avasopasem substantially reduced the incidence of severe esophagitis in patients with lung cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy compared to our expectations based on review of historical data in the literature. Avasopasem was generally well tolerated. The adverse events experienced are comparable to those expected with chemoradiotherapy.

Based on these data, we intend to pursue a strategy for avasopasem, if approved for the reduction of SOM, that involves presenting the AESOP clinical data to entities like the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, to support the use of avasopasem to reduce esophagitis as a medically accepted indication in published drug compendia, notwithstanding that this indication may not be approved by the FDA.
 Increasing Anti-Cancer Efficacy of Radiotherapy (Radiosensitization)
 As cancer cells are much more sensitive than normal cells to elevated hydrogen peroxide, we believe the conversion of excess superoxide to hydrogen peroxide by our dismutase mimetics has the potential to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. We are developing rucosopasem with the goal to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of high daily doses of radiotherapy, which we have demonstrated in our preclinical studies. A preclinical research article was published in Science Translational Medicine in May 2021 describing the synergy of our selective dismutase mimetics in combination with SBRT in killing tumors. This increased efficacy could be particularly important in settings where the current anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy alone is insufficient to achieve the desired outcome.
Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Overview
Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which solid tumors form in the tissues of the pancreas. It is a particularly aggressive form of cancer and represents the third-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States with approximately 64,000 new diagnoses and 50,500 deaths estimated in 2023. Globally, pancreatic cancer accounted for almost as many deaths (446,000) as new diagnoses (496,000) in 2020. Over 30% of newly diagnosed patients have non-metastatic disease that is unresectable due to the location of the primary tumor or its relationship to the surrounding vasculature. The first line of treatment for patients with unresectable tumors is chemotherapy. For

those patients whose tumors remain unresectable following chemotherapy, SBRT is an emerging treatment option. Even with SBRT as an option, patients with pancreatic cancer often have a poor prognosis, with a five-year survival rate of only approximately 10%. As a result, there remains a large unmet need to increase the effectiveness of disease management and ultimately improve outcomes for patients.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Overview
According to the NCI, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. The NCI estimates that in 2023 there will be approximately 238,000 new cases of lung cancer (both NSCLC and small cell lung cancer) in the United States and approximately 127,000 deaths. Approximately 195,000 patients will be diagnosed with NSCLC in the United States in 2023 and are typically treated with some combination of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, depending on the severity of their disease, and SBRT is an established radiotherapy treatment for some forms of NSCLC. Even with all these current treatment options, NSCLC remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. As such, improving the effectiveness of lung cancer treatment and improving patient outcomes represents a significant unmet need.
Our Solution: Rucosopasem (GC4711) for Increasing Anti-Cancer Efficacy in Patients Receiving SBRT
Rucosopasem is our second dismutase mimetic product candidate. We are specifically developing rucosopasem, an analog of avasopasem, with the goal of increasing the anti-cancer efficacy of SBRT. Based on our extensive preclinical data and positive data from our proof-of-concept pilot LAPC trial, we believe rucosopasem has the potential to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. By adding rucosopasem to an SBRT regimen, we believe that our dismutase mimetics’ conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide may increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy at current doses.
Phase 1 Trials
 In December 2017, we completed a Phase 1 single-dose trial of intravenously administered rucosopasem in Australia. In March 2020, we completed a second Phase 1 single-ascending dose and multiple-dose trial of rucosopasem administered by 15-minute intravenous infusions to healthy volunteers in Australia.

In these trials, rucosopasem was observed to be well tolerated. There were no Grade 3, 4, or 5 adverse events, and no adverse events led to withdrawal from these trials. We used the results of these trials to identify the dose and schedule of rucosopasem to be studied in future trials and to support an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, submission to initiate clinical trials evaluating intravenous rucosopasem delivered via 15-minute infusion.
Preclinical Results
We have observed in multiple xenograft and syngeneic tumor mouse models a strong correlation between the daily dose of radiation and the increase in anti-cancer efficacy with our selective dismutase mimetics. Notably, we observed that many of the mice at the highest daily dose of radiotherapy with a dismutase mimetic became tumor-free. The results of one such study, in which mice bearing NSCLC xenograft tumors received 24 mg/kg of avasopasem daily for five days concurrent with one of four different radiotherapy dosage regimens, are depicted below. For example, 5 Gy x 5 RT indicates that the mice received five daily doses of five Gy each. These radiotherapy regimens were selected because, without the addition of our dismutase mimetic, each should produce an equivalent reduction in tumor growth. The data reflects that expected result, but the increase in anti-cancer efficacy with addition of the dismutase mimetic increases significantly at the higher daily doses of radiotherapy.

H1299 Human NSCLC Tumors in Mice



In another preclinical study, mice bearing pancreatic cancer xenograft tumors treated with a single 12 Gy dose demonstrated a meaningful decrease in tumor volume when avasopasem was added, as depicted below. We believe that this result shows that our dismutase mimetics have the potential to synergize with SBRT to rapidly convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and exploit cancer cells’ increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide to promote cancer cell death.



Additional preclinical studies have provided further evidence supporting our dismutase mimetics’ biological mechanism in combination with radiotherapy in solid tumors. To test the hypothesis that our dismutase mimetics’ conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide increases the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy, we genetically engineered NSCLC tumors to overexpress catalase enzyme when triggered. This overexpression of catalase, a native enzyme that rapidly removes hydrogen peroxide, blocked the dismutase mimetic’s synergy with radiotherapy in an experiment similar to the ones described above.




We believe the results of our studies represent significant potential in the treatment of cancer, particularly as recent advances in radiotherapy, such as SBRT, are capable of administering targeted, high daily doses of radiotherapy to solid tumors. SBRT utilizes several beams of various intensities aimed at different angles to precisely target the tumor, with the goal of delivering the highest possible dose of radiotherapy to kill cancer cells while minimizing exposure to normal cells. For example, SBRT is an established radiotherapy treatment for NSCLC, used increasingly for small, peripheral lung tumors. Data to date suggest that SBRT could also increase the anti-cancer efficacy and safety of radiotherapy for many other patients with NSCLC, LAPC and other cancers. SBRT application for large or centrally located NSCLC tumors, however, faces unique challenges, as lung and other toxicities limit the amount of radiotherapy patients can tolerate. As such, the most suitable patients for this procedure currently are those with smaller, well-defined tumors who are ineligible for or cannot tolerate surgery.
The increase in anti-cancer efficacy of SBRT with our dismutase mimetics has been shown in a variety of models of lung, pancreatic, head and neck, breast and other cancers. In addition, because low oxygen levels typically found deep in larger tumors can interfere with the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy, it is important that our dismutase mimetics appear to also increase anti-cancer efficacy in hypoxic tumor models. Further, they may also reduce the normal tissue toxicities that restrict the patients now eligible for SBRT. Because of this we believe that the combination of rucosopasem and SBRT has the potential to further increase the anti-cancer efficacy of and to broaden the group of patients who can benefit from SBRT.
The clinical research community is also exploring the possibility of increasing the anti-cancer efficacy of SBRT by combining it with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, merging the targeted efficacy of radiotherapy with the demonstrated durability of checkpoint therapy. In preclinical models combining our dismutase mimetics with SBRT and anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 or anti-CTLA4 checkpoint therapy, this triple combination was more effective than combinations of SBRT combined with checkpoint therapy or SBRT combined with dismutase mimetic. The triple combination increased control of the irradiated primary tumors and also appeared to reduce the metastatic spread of the cancer and even controlled pre-existing tumors outside the radiation field. Based upon these data, we believe there is an opportunity to assess the combination of SBRT, checkpoint therapy and rucosopasem as a novel approach to treating various cancers.
Clinical Development for Increasing Anti-Cancer Efficacy

Phase 1/2 Pilot Trial of Avasopasem in Patients with LAPC
In September 2021, we announced final results from a pilot Phase 1/2 safety and anti-cancer efficacy trial of avasopasem in combination with SBRT in patients with unresectable or borderline resectable LAPC. The primary objective of this trial was to determine the maximum tolerated daily dose of SBRT in conjunction with our dismutase mimetic, with secondary measures assessing, among others, OS, PFS, resectability and overall response rate compared to placebo. The trial was designed to evaluate three dose levels of SBRT, with each patient receiving five doses of SBRT. SBRT daily dose levels ranged from 10 Gy/dose to 12 Gy/dose.


The results included a minimum follow up of one year on all 42 patients enrolled in the trial. In this proof-of-concept trial, relative improvements were observed in OS, PFS, local tumor control and time to distant metastases. 46% of patients in the active arm were alive at last follow-up (11 out of 24) compared to 33% in the placebo arm (6 out of 18). 29% of patients in the active arm achieved a 30% or greater decrease in primary tumor size (partial response) compared to 11% of patients in the placebo arm. Avasopasem was well tolerated, with similar rates of early and late adverse events in the active and placebo arms. The data from this trial enabled us to select the SBRT regimen for our subsequent trial in this indication, the GRECO-2 trial, of five daily doses at 10 Gy/dose.
Improvements Across All Efficacy Parameters
 
Ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial of rucosopasem in Patients with NSCLC (GRECO-1 Trial)
In October 2020, we initiated a Phase 1/2 trial of rucosopasem in combination with SBRT in patients with NSCLC, which we refer to as the GRECO-1 trial. The GRECO-1 trial is supported in part by a Small Business Innovation Research grant from the NCI for the investigation of our dismutase mimetics in combination with SBRT for the treatment of lung cancer. We intend for this trial to assess the anti-cancer efficacy and safety of rucosopasem in combination with SBRT. Subsequently, in a separate trial, we intend to assess the anti-cancer efficacy and safety of rucosopasem in combination with SBRT and a checkpoint inhibitor.
 The trial was designed to enroll approximately five patients with locally advanced NSCLC as part of the Phase 1 open-label safety run-in portion of the trial. Patients received 100 mg of rucosopasem with SBRT over five consecutive weekdays. Following the safety run-in cohort, up to 66 NSCLC patients with locally advanced disease will receive 100 mg of rucosopasem with SBRT or placebo with SBRT over five consecutive weekdays in the randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2 portion of trial.
 The primary objective of the trial is to assess safety with secondary measures assessing, among others, objective response rate, PFS and OS.
In June 2022, we reported interim results from the Phase 1 open-label stage of the trial with six months follow-up on all seven patients enrolled. Rucosopasem in combination with SBRT appeared to be well tolerated through the cutoff date of June 14, 2022. The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, cough, and nausea, which are common in patients with lung cancer receiving radiotherapy. Through six months, in-field partial responses were observed in three patients and stable disease was observed in three others based on RECIST criteria. These results

include target tumor reductions in five patients of 61%, 58%, 33%, 29% and 27% and one patient with an 8% increase as of the cutoff date. Preservation of pulmonary lung function was also observed compared to expectations based on review of historical literature evaluating pulmonary function in a similar patient population with SBRT alone.
We expect to complete enrollment in the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 stage of the GRECO-1 trial in the second half of 2023.
Ongoing Phase 2b Trial of rucosopasem in Patients with LAPC (GRECO-2 Trial)
 In May 2021, we initiated a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial of rucosopasem in combination with SBRT in patients with LAPC, which we refer to as the GRECO-2 trial. We expect to enroll approximately 160 patients in this trial.
The primary objective of this trial is to determine the impact on OS of adding 100 mg of rucosopasem to SBRT following chemotherapy in patients with unresectable or borderline resectable nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer. Key secondary objectives, among others, will include PFS, locoregional tumor control, time to distant metastases, surgical resection outcomes, and objective response rate. We expect to complete enrollment in the GRECO-2 trial in the second half of 2023.
 Oral and Other Formulations
Preclinical studies conducted by us suggest that rucosopasem and other novel dismutase mimetics in our portfolio can also be delivered by other routes of administration beyond intravenous, and one or more of these may be considered for future development.
 Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the supply of current good manufacturing practice-, or cGMP-, grade clinical trial materials and commercial quantities of our product candidates and products, if approved. We require all of our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with cGMP requirements, and we maintain our product candidates in refrigerated conditions prior to intravenous infusion. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality and regulatory oversight of our CMOs.
We anticipate that these CMOs will have the capacity to support both clinical supply and commercial-scale production. We have a formal agreement with Patheon Manufacturing Services LLC, or Patheon, for commercial production of avasopasem, if approved. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Patheon Manufacturing Agreements” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 We also may elect to pursue additional CMOs for manufacturing supplies of drug substance and finished drug product in the future. We believe that our standardized manufacturing process can be transferred to a number of other CMOs for the production of clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates in the ordinary course of business.
Commercialization
Our aim is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company. At our current stage, we have a small commercial organization but have not yet established sales or distribution capabilities. We intend to commercialize avasopasem, if approved, by expanding our commercial organization by building a specialized sales and marketing organization in the United States focused on radiation and medical oncologists, who are the primary decision makers in the prescribing and/or infusion of therapies in patients with HNC undergoing standard-of-care treatment.

We believe a scientifically oriented, customer-focused team of approximately 40 sales representatives would allow us to effectively reach the approximately 5,000 radiation oncologists in the United States, who treat patients using an even smaller number of radiation machines. There are approximately 2,500 radiotherapy treatment sites in the United States. Based on a third-party claims database, we estimate that over 80% of radiotherapy treatments for HNC patients are performed at approximately 700 sites. Most of these treatment sites are hospitals and the majority have the ability to administer intravenous infusion therapies either in the radiation or medical oncology suite and/or in the hospital outpatient infusion department. In the hospital setting, infusions are often administered on the same floor or in the same building where the radiation therapy is delivered.
 We expect avasopasem to be reimbursed as an outpatient therapy through a “buy-and-bill” model of reimbursement under Medicare Part B or a medical benefit under commercial insurance. Under the “buy-and-bill” model, institutions or providers will buy the drug and then submit a claim for reimbursement from the payer once the drug has been administered to the patient. Hospital care data suggests the payer mix for patients with HNC to be approximately 50% Medicare, 30% commercial, 12% Medicaid, 3% self-pay and 5% other (which may include payers such as the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, TRICARE and workers compensation). Data also suggests that a majority of the hospital treatment sites are eligible for the 340B Drug Pricing Program.
Because of the limited number of physicians concentrated around a smaller number of radiation machines, we believe we can effectively commercialize avasopasem, if approved, in the United States with a small, focused commercial organization. We also expect to leverage this sales organization to commercialize rucosopasem, if approved, and any of our future product candidates in the United States. We may seek to establish collaborations for the commercialization of avasopasem, rucosopasem, and our other product candidates in the United States and in other regions such as Europe and Asia.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries put significant emphasis and resources into the development of novel and proprietary therapies for cancer treatment. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatment options and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our potential competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, a more established presence in the market, and more expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These potential competitors may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of avasopasem, rucosopasem and any of our other product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of OM in patients with HNC and no FDA-approved drugs or established guidelines for the treatment of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis.
A number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell drugs or biologics are pursuing the development of therapies in the fields in which we are interested. Our commercial opportunity for any of our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, more convenient or easier to administer, or have fewer or less severe side effects, than any products that we may develop. Because our product candidates are designed to reduce the side effects, or to increase the anti-cancer efficacy, of radiotherapy, our commercial

opportunities could also be reduced or eliminated if radiotherapy methods are improved in a way that reduces the incidence of such side effects or increases anti-cancer efficacy, or if new therapies are developed which effectively treat cancer without causing such side effects. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for avasopasem, rucosopasem and any of our other product candidates, manufacturing methods and processes, novel discoveries, and other know-how; to operate without infringing on or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our product candidates and other proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements, including claims related to composition of matter and methods of use, that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Patents and Patent Applications
As of December 31, 2022, our owned and currently pending and/or in-force patent portfolio consisted of approximately 18 issued U.S. patents, 12 pending U.S. patent applications, 112 issued foreign patents including 4 issued European patents that have been validated in many European countries, and 107 pending foreign applications.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier expiring patent. In some instances, such a patent term adjustment may result in the term of a United States patent extending beyond 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the term of a patent that covers a drug product may also be eligible for patent term extension when regulatory approval is granted, provided the legal requirements are met. This permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to a maximum of five years beyond the expiration of the patent if the patent is eligible for such an extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review; however, it cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors.
The two most advanced product candidates in our portfolio, avasopasem and rucosopasem, are protected by issued patents with claims directed to composition of matter and method of use. Avasopasem is covered by a composition of matter patent in the United States that had a natural expiration date in March 2022. The U.S. patent family covering the method of treating OM has a natural expiration date in late 2027, and if we are successful in obtaining a patent term extension of approximately two and a half years which we believe should be available, the extension would result in an expiration date in 2031. The U.S. patent family covering treating tissue damage resulting from radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a combination thereof by administering high doses of

avasopasem, including that tested in the ROMAN Phase 3 trial, has a natural expiration date in 2032, and if we are successful in obtaining a patent term extension which we believe should be available, the extension would result in an expiration date in late 2034 to early 2035. In any event, we can only extend one applicable patent for each approved drug. Rucosopasem is covered by a composition of matter patent in the United States, which also covers oral bioavailability of the product candidate, and has a natural expiration date in 2036. However, we believe the rucosopasem composition of matter patent may be eligible for a patent term extension of at least about two years which, if granted, would result in an expiration date in 2038. When including only current issued patents and related potential patent term extensions, our product candidate patent portfolio is projected to expire between 2031 and 2038 in the United States. Additional pending or future patent applications may supplement or extend this patent portfolio.
 However, there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. The applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, may not agree with our assessment of whether such patent term extensions should be granted, and if granted, they may grant more limited extensions than we request.
We also have pending patent families in the United States that cover certain combinations of our product candidates with several oncology products and therapies that may provide protection for the use of our product candidates in connection with those oncology products and therapies, which, if granted, are projected to expire between 2037 and 2041.
Trademarks and Trade Secrets
As of December 31, 2022, our owned and currently pending and/or in-force trademark portfolio consisted of 3 registered U.S. trademarks, 9 pending U.S. trademark applications, 26 registered foreign trademarks, and 9 pending foreign trademark applications.
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with an employee or a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Royalty Agreement with Blackstone Life Sciences (Formerly Known as Clarus Ventures)
 In November 2018, we entered into the Royalty Agreement with Blackstone Life Sciences. Pursuant to the Royalty Agreement, Blackstone agreed to pay us, in the aggregate, up to $80.0 million, or the Royalty Purchase Price, in four tranches of $20.0 million each upon the achievement of specified clinical milestones in our ROMAN trial. We agreed to apply the proceeds from such payments primarily to support clinical development and regulatory activities for avasopasem, rucosopasem and any pharmaceutical product comprising or containing avasopasem or rucosopasem, or, collectively, the Products, as well as to satisfy working capital obligations and for general corporate expenses. We received the first tranche of the Royalty Purchase Price in November 2018, the second tranche of the Royalty Purchase Price in April 2019, and the third tranche of the Royalty Purchase Price in February 2020, in each case in connection with the achievement of the first three milestones, respectively, under the Royalty Agreement.
In May 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Royalty Agreement, or the Amendment, with Clarus IV Galera Royalty AIV, L.P., or the Blackstone Purchaser. The Blackstone Purchaser is affiliated with Blackstone Life Sciences, successor in interest to Clarus Ventures. The Amendment increased the Royalty Purchase Price by $37.5 million to $117.5 million by increasing the fourth tranche from $20.0 million to $37.5 million and adding a new $20.0 million tranche upon the achievement of an additional clinical enrollment milestone. We

received the new $20.0 million tranche of the Amendment in June 2021, in connection with the enrollment of the first patient in the GRECO-2 trial. Also in June 2021, we completed enrollment in the ROMAN trial, thereby achieving the milestone associated with the fourth tranche, and received the associated $37.5 million in July 2021.
Pursuant to the amended Royalty Agreement, in connection with the payment of each tranche of the Royalty Purchase Price, we have agreed to sell, convey, transfer and assign to Blackstone all of our right, title and interest in a high single-digit percentage of (i) worldwide net sales of the Products and (ii) all amounts received by us or our affiliates, licensees and sublicensees with respect to Product-related damages (collectively, the Product Payments) during the Royalty Period. The Royalty Period means, on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis, the period of time commencing on the commercial launch of such Product in such country and ending on the latest to occur of (i) the 12th anniversary of such commercial launch, (ii) the expiration of all valid claims of our patents covering such Product in such country, and (iii) the expiration of regulatory data protection or market exclusivity or similar regulatory protection afforded by the health authorities in such country, to the extent such protection or exclusivity effectively prevents generic versions of such Product from entering the market in such country.
The amended Royalty Agreement will remain in effect until the date on which the aggregate amount of the Product Payments paid to Blackstone exceeds a fixed single-digit multiple of the actual amount of the Royalty Purchase Price received by us, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the mutual written agreement of us and Blackstone. If no Products are commercialized, we would not have an obligation to make Product Payments to Blackstone, which is the sole mechanism for repaying the liability.
In May 2020, as partial consideration for the Amendment, we issued two warrants to the Blackstone Purchaser to purchase an aggregate of 550,661 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to $13.62 per share, each of which became exercisable upon the receipt by Galera of the applicable specified milestone payment. The issued warrants expire six years after the initial exercise date of each respective warrant.
 Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 


•submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of any FDA inspections or audits of the sponsor, clinical research organizations and clinical study sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data;
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and 
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or to conduct a post-approval study. 
 Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

•Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
 •Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the PDUFA guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. The actual review time may be significantly longer, depending on the complexity of the review, FDA requests for additional information and the sponsor’s submission of additional information.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical trials or preclinical studies in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
FDA Expedited Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product candidate is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need for such disease or condition. The sponsor of a fast track-designated product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development. In addition, the FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track-designated product candidate on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to NDAs for drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission.
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful advantages over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies in a timely manner or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

The FDA may also designate a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy, which is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval and approval is not guaranteed. Such designation may, however, expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warning or other safety information about the product; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 


•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 The Hatch-Waxman Act and Marketing Applications for Follow-On Drugs
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute and also enacted Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug.
 
Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent that has claims that cover the applicant’s product or method of therapeutic use. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. If an applicable patent issues between filing and approval, the applicant is required to amend the application to include that patent. Companies also may list applicable patents in the Orange Book after receiving product approval so long as the patent is submitted to FDA within 30 days of patent issuance. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. The ANDA requests permission to market a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the RLD and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the RLD. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, nonclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug referenced by the ANDA applicant if the FDA’s listing for the generic drug in the Orange Book indicates that it is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD.
 In contrast, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. A Section 505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies if it can establish that reliance on studies conducted for a previously approved product is scientifically appropriate. Unlike the ANDA pathway used by developers of bioequivalent versions of innovator drugs, which does not allow applicants to submit new clinical data other than bioavailability or bioequivalence data, the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway does not preclude the possibility that a follow-on applicant would need to conduct additional clinical trials or nonclinical studies; for example, it may be seeking approval to market a previously

approved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness.
 When an ANDA applicant submits its application to the FDA, it is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement, certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain or carves out any language regarding the patented method-of-use, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. Moreover, to the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant also is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
If the applicant does not challenge the innovator’s listed patents, FDA will not approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 
Non-Patent Exclusivity
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of non-patent data exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. During the exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for review any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed on an NCE patent and any time after approval if the application is filed based on a new indication or a new formulation.
 The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of data exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving follow-on applications for drugs containing the original active agent. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Five-year and three-year exclusivity also will not delay the submission or approval of a traditional NDA filed under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. However, an applicant submitting a traditional NDA would be required to either conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Other Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, and transparency laws and regulations with respect to drug pricing and payments and other

transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals, as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Violations of such laws, or any other governmental regulations that apply, may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting and oversight obligations, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and individual imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. With respect to off-label uses, third-party payors may provide coverage and reimbursement under certain limited circumstances. By way of example, Medicare covers off-label uses of FDA-approved drugs if the use is supported as a medically accepted indication by certain compendia and is not otherwise listed as unsupported, not indicated, not recommended, or equivalent terms, in any such compendia. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. Moreover, for drugs and biologics administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such products. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products.
Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect the pharmaceutical industry. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs and reimbursement adjustments. Additionally, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program,

under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers until 2032, which was temporarily suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, and further reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several presidential executive orders. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, or AMP, beginning January 1, 2024. More recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional government action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from the comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product candidates in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Non-Clinical Studies and Clinical Trials
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union, or EU, are subject to significant regulatory controls.
  Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new biological substances. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice, or GLP, as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be

planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU member states, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR, which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.
 While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application, or CTA, to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed.
 The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. Clinical trials for which an application was submitted (i) prior to January 31, 2022 under the Clinical Trials Directive, or (ii) between January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2023 and for which the sponsor has opted for the application of the Clinical Trials Directive remain governed by said Directive until January 31, 2025. After this date, all clinical trials (including those which are ongoing) will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.
 Marketing Authorization
 In the EU, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit an MA application, or MAA. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product.
 Essentially, there are two types of MAs:
•”Centralized MAs” are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and are valid throughout the entire territory of the EU. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) designated orphan medicines and (iv) advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy 


or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases.
 •“National MAs” are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their respective territory, and are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the national competent authority of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
 Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a CHMP rapporteur before submission of a MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process.
 Moreover, in the EU, a “conditional” MA may be granted in cases where all the required safety and efficacy data are not yet available. The conditional MA is subject to conditions to be fulfilled for generating the missing data or ensuring increased safety measures. It is valid for one year and has to be renewed annually until fulfillment of all the conditions. Once the pending studies are provided, it can become a “normal” MA. However, if the conditions are not fulfilled within the timeframe set by the EMA, the MA ceases to be renewed. Furthermore, MA may also be granted “under exceptional circumstances” when the applicant can show that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use even after the product has been authorized and subject to specific procedures being introduced. This may arise in particular when the intended indications are very rare and, in the present state of scientific knowledge, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally accepted ethical principles. This MA is close to the conditional MA as it is reserved to medicinal products to be approved for severe diseases or unmet medical needs and the applicant does not hold the complete data set legally required for the grant of a MA. However, unlike the conditional MA, the applicant does not have to provide the missing data and will never have to. Although the MA “under exceptional circumstances” is granted definitively, the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is reviewed annually and the MA is withdrawn in case the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable.
 Under the above described procedures, in order to grant the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU member states make an assessment of the risk benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.
Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving MA, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two‑year period of market exclusivity, a generic/biosimilar MA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic/biosimilar product can be marketed until the

expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period may be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years, a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU or member state regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
Post-Approval Requirements
 Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
 The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 
Since the end of the Brexit transition period on January 1, 2021, Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) has not been subject to EU laws, however under the terms of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, Northern Ireland continues to follow EU law. The EU laws that have been transposed into United Kingdom, or UK, law through secondary legislation remain applicable in Great Britain. However, under the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill 2022, which is currently before the UK parliament, any retained EU law not expressly preserved and “assimilated” into domestic law or extended by ministerial regulations (to no later than 23 June 2026) will automatically expire and be revoked by December 31, 2023. In addition, new legislation such as the EU CTR will not be applicable. The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement

existing regulations in the area of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials and medical devices.
 
As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, is the UK’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. The MHRA has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, including a 150-day assessment and a rolling review procedure. All existing EU MAs for centrally authorized products were automatically converted or grandfathered into UK MAs, effective in Great Britain (only), free of charge on January 1, 2021, unless the MA holder chose to opt-out. After Brexit, companies established in the UK cannot use the centralized procedure and instead must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures or one of the remaining post-Brexit international cooperation procedures to obtain an MA to commercialize products in the UK. For a period of three years from 1 January 2021, the MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the EU Commission on the approval of a new (centralized procedure) MA when determining an application for a Great Britain authorization; or use the MHRA’s decentralized or mutual recognition procedures which enable MAs approved in EU member states (or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) to be granted in Great Britain.
 Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information and could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain foreign laws, such as the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, the “UK GDPR”), govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
