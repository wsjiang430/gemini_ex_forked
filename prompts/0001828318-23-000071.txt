Company Overview
Enovix Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “Enovix”) is on a mission to power the technologies of the future. We do this by designing, developing, manufacturing and commercializing next generation Lithium-ion, or Li-ion, battery cells that significantly increase the amount of energy density and storage capacity relative to conventional battery cells. Our battery’s mechanical design, or “architecture,” allows us to use high performance chemistries while enabling safety and charge time advantages.
The benefit of an enhanced battery for portable electronics is devices that have more power budget available to keep up with user preferences for more advanced features and more attractive form factors. The benefit of an advanced battery for Electric Vehicles (“EVs”) is a faster charging battery that reduces the cost per mile due to higher energy density. 
Enovix was established in 2007 based on the premise that fundamentally altering battery performance would require a reinvention of the battery’s architecture. Our architecture allows us to use 100% active silicon and no graphite in the battery’s anode, which is the negative electrode that stores lithium ions when a battery is charged. The advantage of silicon over graphite is that it can theoretically store more than twice as much lithium as graphite, which increases a battery’s energy density and overall capacity. The battery industry has historically struggled to incorporate more than a small amount of silicon in the anode because silicon can swell and crack in conventional architectures, impacting safety and performance. By contrast, our architecture is designed to accommodate silicon’s swelling and apply stack pressure that alleviates the cracking problem.
We have devoted significant funds and resources to develop our battery’s architecture and the unique patterning and stacking assembly process for manufacturing our cells. This was done in conjunction with partnership and investment from several strategic partners in the solar and semiconductor industries. Since 2018, we have sampled batteries to multiple customers that have validated the performance of our products. In 2020, we started procuring equipment for our first production line (“Fab-1”). We recognized our first production revenue in the second quarter of 2022 from Fab-1.
Industry Background
Limited Innovation in Battery Technology for 30 Years
In 1991 Sony developed the first Li-ion battery for consumer electronics to power its newly invented handheld video recorder, which needed smaller and lighter batteries with more energy than those available at the time. The camcorder team, with years of experience in coating magnetic tapes, developed a battery based on that technology. Their architecture, sometimes referred to as a “Jelly Roll”, consists of an anode (A) in a long strip format, a long strip cathode (C) and two long strip separators (S), all on rolls, which are interleaved and then wound together into a Jelly Roll in this order: ASCSASCS…
The Jelly Roll is then placed in a hermetic package and filled with electrolyte, an organic liquid through which the lithium ions repeatedly travel back and forth between the battery’s anode and the cathode. During charging, the lithium ions cycle from the cathode (the positive electrode), through tiny holes in the separator, and into the anode (the negative electrode). This process is reversed when the battery is discharged. This basic construct of a Li-ion battery has remained unchanged for nearly 30 years.
Historically, advancements in battery performance have come primarily from improvements in the active cathode and anode materials of the battery. The process of new materials discovery, development, testing and qualification is by its nature a slow and arduous process and resulted in an anemic rate of battery improvement. At the same time, the electronic devices that these batteries power have dramatically increased their product features and energy requirements by capitalizing on the rapid and continuous electronic miniaturization provided by the semiconductor integrated circuit (“IC”) industry. This phenomenon, known as “Moore’s Law”, has resulted in electronic components doubling their transistor density (and thus the IC product features) about every two years. The disparity in improvement rates between ICs and batteries has forced the consumer devices industry to compromise the usable feature sets and the operating time between battery charges.
A Fundamentally Better Approach
We were founded by a team of individuals with expertise in three dimensional (“3D”) architectures learned from 25 years of experience in the manufacturing of hard disk drives (IBM) and semiconductor wafer probing systems (FormFactor). Rather than focusing solely on the materials inside the battery, we began development of a novel 3D physical battery design, one that could both improve the packing efficiency of the active materials in the battery as well as accommodate the use of a 100% active silicon anode.
Our founders conceived a completely different design for a battery. Rather than interleaving and winding long anode, cathode and separator strips into a Jelly Roll, our founders proposed an architecture in which many short anodes and cathodes were positioned side by side, with a separator between each anode-cathode pair. 
This architecture allows for a more efficient use of the volume of the battery, in contrast to the Jelly Roll battery, in which significant volume is wasted at the corners and in gaps in the center of the battery, given the lack of precision of the winding process. This increase in volume efficiency alone improves the energy density of our batteries over a Jelly Roll cell.
Uniquely Enabling Silicon Anodes
Looking at a problem from a different perspective often yields new opportunities and solutions that would otherwise not be possible. This is the case with our 3D cell architecture. Rather than having long, wound electrodes that run parallel to the face of the battery, our cells have many small electrodes that are orthogonal to the largest face of the battery. This seemingly small difference has huge benefits. Specifically, our 3D cell architecture is well-suited to accommodate the use of a silicon anode and therefore capitalize on the higher energy density it provides, as described below.
Silicon has long been heralded as the next important anode material. Silicon anodes can theoretically store more than twice as much lithium than the graphite anode that is used in nearly all Li-ion batteries today (1800mAh/cm3 vs. 800mAh/ cm3). Once successfully integrated into a battery, silicon anodes are theoretically capable of increasing a Li-ion battery’s capacity by about 36% and a corresponding increase in energy density.
Silicon’s high energy density, however, creates four significant technical problems that must be solved: 
•Formation expansion. “Formation” is the term for the first charging of the battery, when lithium moves from the cathode, through the separator, to the anode. When fully charged, a silicon anode can more than double in thickness, resulting in significant swelling that can physically damage the battery, causing failure.
•Formation efficiency. When first charged, a silicon anode can absorb and permanently trap as much as roughly 40% to 50% of the original lithium in the battery, reducing the battery’s capacity by about 50% to 60%.
•Cycle swelling. A silicon anode will swell and shrink when the battery is charged and discharged, respectively, causing damage to both the package and the silicon particles in the anode, which can crack, and further trap lithium on the fresh silicon surfaces exposed by the crack.
•Cycle life. Silicon particles can become electrically disconnected from the electrode when the silicon anode is in its shrunken state and can crack when the silicon anode is swollen, both of which can lower cycle life. In addition, when silicon particles become disconnected from the electrode, they are no longer able to accept lithium and neighboring particles must absorb the excess, causing over charging and further opportunities for physical damage.
Left unaddressed, these four problems have limited the practical application of silicon anodes in conventional lithium-ion battery cells. Our 3D cell architecture uniquely solves these four technical problems to enable 100% active silicon anodes.
Problem 1 — Formation expansion
In a conventional graphite anode, lithium atoms slip into the vacant spaces between the graphite layers, forming LiC6, resulting in very little graphite anode swelling during cycling (<10%). In a silicon anode, however, lithium atoms form a lithium-silicon alloy that does not have such vacant spaces, forming Li15Si4. While this alloying process results in an increased ability to store lithium, it also causes significant expansion of the anode material during charging, creating high pressure within the battery (1,500 psi).
If a silicon anode were used in a conventional battery architecture, the pressure of anode swelling would act on the large face of the battery, creating a force as large as 1.7 tons for a battery in a 50mm x 30mm x 3mm size battery. This force is analogous to a car standing on top of a cell phone sized battery.
By contrast, when silicon anodes are used in our 3D cell architecture, the anodes do not face the largest side of the battery; instead the anodes face a short side of the battery. Because these anode faces are small in area, this same 1,500 psi pressure, therefore, creates a force of only 210 pounds in the same size battery.
To manage these 210 pounds of force, we invented a very thin (50-micron) stainless steel constraint system to surround the battery. This constraint system limits the battery from swelling and growing in size. Moreover, the constraint system keeps the anode and cathode materials under constant compression, maintaining excellent particle-to-particle connection.
Problem 2 — Formation Efficiency
The first time a Li-ion battery is charged or formed, some of the lithium is permanently trapped in undesired side-reactions and surface layers on the anode and cathode particles. These losses proportionately reduce the capacity of the battery by removing lithium.
During formation of a conventional Li-ion battery with a graphite anode, approximately 5% of the lithium from a lithium cobalt oxide cathode will get permanently trapped in the graphite anode, never to return to the cathode.
A silicon anode, by contrast, has a formation efficiency of roughly 50% to 60%, meaning that about 40% to 50% of the lithium is trapped in the silicon anode during formation and is no longer available for repeated cycling, reducing the battery’s capacity in half.
Our 3D cell architecture uniquely enables a practical solution to this problem. Our cell assembly process has an added step called “pre-lithiation,” in which a thin lithium source is placed on top of the cell, within the package. By electrochemically coupling this lithium source to the electrodes, additional lithium can be dosed into the cell, replenishing the lithium lost during formation. Moreover, additional lithium beyond the initial replenishment can be dosed, providing a reservoir of lithium to a) counteract the normal lithium consumption that occurs in every battery during its life and b) provide the proper voltage balance to keep the minimum discharge voltage in the regime to be useful for devices.
The physical process by which the added lithium moves into the battery is called diffusion. The time required for lithium atoms to diffuse is proportional to the square of the diffusion distance. In a conventional battery architecture, the length of the electrode can be on the order of dozens of millimeters resulting in a pre-lithiation process that could take weeks to accomplish if a thin lithium source were placed on top of the cell. In our 3D cell architecture, however, the lithium is required to travel a short distance, which can be accomplished in hours. 
Problems 3 & 4 — Swelling and Cycle Life
When conventional Li-ion batteries with graphite anodes are cycled (charged and discharged), they exhibit a modest amount of cyclic swelling (<10%). Silicon anodes, by contrast, can swell by 20%, or more. The continuous swelling and shrinking during charging and discharging can fracture the anode silicon particles and/or electrically disconnect them and limit cycle life to less than 100 cycles, which is not commercially viable in many applications. Additionally, any swelling in the cell over its lifetime must be accommodated by larger cavity volume, effectively reducing the practical energy density of the cell.
Our unique structural constraint system applies a uniform engineered pressure on the silicon particles within the anode, limiting their fracture and maintaining electrical contact between them for an extended number of cycles. Cycle swelling is thus kept under 2%, outperforming even conventional graphite anodes. Our cells that have been cycled over 500 times show minimal expansion of the electrodes by contrast.
By addressing swelling, our 3D cell architecture with its constraint system is designed to enable silicon anodes to achieve the commercial cycling standard of 500 complete charge/discharge cycles to 80% remaining capacity with improvements planned on our roadmap. A complete charge/discharge cycle is where the battery is charged all the way to 4.35V and then discharged to 2.7V.
Benefits of Our Advanced Li-ion Battery
IoT – The Internet-of-Things (“IoT”) market includes many types of devices powered by a Li-ion battery, including wearables, health/wellness devices, camera-based devices, location trackers, portable networking devices, augmented reality/virtual reality devices (“AR/VR”), and computing accessories, among others. Products in this market are often power budget constrained due to size. There is also a constant appetite in this market for power-hungry features such as sensors, high-speed connectivity, and utilization of artificial intelligence (“AI”) processing. 
Mobile — The Li-ion battery also provided the increase in energy density needed for cell phones to evolve from their original “brick-size” into today’s sleek, sophisticated smartphone. Energy requirements continue to become more demanding as device OEMs seek to launch power-hungry 5G cell phones with on-board AI. Just as it was 30 years ago, a significant increase in battery energy density will enable mobile device designers to continue improving user experience, functionality and battery life in smaller devices.
In enterprise markets such as Land Mobile Radio (“LMR”), used by police and first responders, increased energy density can be leveraged to reduce product size and weight, while simultaneously enabling new features.
Computing — The Li-ion battery can also be credited for helping to usher in an era of portable PC computing. In 2020, laptops, tablets and hybrids (detachable tablets) were estimated to outship traditional desktop PCs by nearly 5-to-1 according to market-watcher IDC. As a result, users are demanding higher performance from their portable PCs. Ultimately users want “always on, all day” battery life, similar to that which they experience with their cell phones. Increased energy density is needed for this task, along with enabling more power-hungry features.
Electric Vehicles — According to BloombergNEF's Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022, the number of EVs will grow from 6.6 million in 2021 to 20.6 million in 2025. Replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with EVs can reduce emissions that contribute to smog and climate change, but mass adoption of EVs hinges on lower cost vehicles and faster charging times that resemble the gas station experience of filling up quickly. At scale, higher energy density is a key enabler of lowering battery cost as a higher number of watt hours are spread over the cost of the materials. Our cell architecture has been designed for the use of low-cost commodity silicon anode materials as opposed to heavily engineered silicon materials in order to drive toward a lower cost cell on a watt hours basis at scale. Our cell architecture also allows for enhanced thermal performance relative to conventional cells, enabling fast charging. We have demonstrated 0-80% charging in 5.2 minutes on 0.27Ah test cells with EV-class cathodes. 
Producing Our Battery
In addition to designing our battery, we also develop the advanced manufacturing processes needed to produce our batteries in high volume and at low cost. 
We use the conventional Li-ion battery cell manufacturing techniques for process such as electrode coating, cell packaging, test and aging. We then use our own proprietary tools on steps such as cell assembly where we laser pattern and stack the electrodes and then apply a stainless steel constraint.
Standard Li-ion battery production involves: 1) electrode fabrication, 2) cell assembly and 3) battery packaging and formation.
Electrode Fabrication — Sony developed and commercialized the first Li-ion battery in 1991 to meet the power requirements of its new handheld camcorder. Sony’s battery division adapted its existing magnetic recording tape production equipment to make batteries: 1) to mix chemical anode and cathode slurries, 2) to coat them onto metal foil current collectors, 3) to “calender” (flatten) the surface, 4) to slit the coated metal foil into electrode sheets and 5) to roll them up for packaging in cylindrical metal cans. While there have been process improvements over the years, electrodes for conventional Li-ion batteries are still fabricated using this standard method developed almost 30 years ago.
Cell Assembly — Li-ion cells were initially assembled by winding electrodes and separators into a naturally cylindrical Jelly Roll configuration, packaged in a cylindrical metal can. While some Li-ion batteries still use cylindrical metal cans, low-profile portable electronic devices require thinner, flatter cell formats, like the flat Jelly Roll described earlier. Li-ion cell assembly first addressed this need with a wind-and-flatten process introduced in the early 1990s. Today, it is common to wind the Jelly Roll onto a flat–rather than round–metal form. In 1995, cut-and-stack cell assembly improved spatial efficiency, but it is slow, expensive and imprecise. We have developed a more precise roll-to-stack cell assembly process to enable a silicon anode that increases Li-ion cell energy density and maintains high cycle life.
Wind-and-Flatten Cell Assembly — Wind-and-flatten cell assembly, introduced in the early 1990s, essentially flattens the cylindrical Jelly Roll into a thin, flat package for use in portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and mobile phones. The wind-and-flatten electrode assembly can be packaged in a metal case, but it is most often packaged in a polymer pouch for portable electronic device applications. It can also be produced in larger formats, with welded aluminum housings for electric powertrains in EVs.
Cut-and-Stack Cell Assembly — Cut-and-stack cell assembly was introduced in 1995. Instead of winding and flattening, electrodes and separators are cut (or punched) into sheets, which are stacked horizontally. Cut-and-stack assembly provides better spatial efficiency than Jelly Roll wind-and-flatten assembly because the volume lost in the core is eliminated and space at the outside edges is reduced. Cut-and-stack cells are used in consumer, military and EV applications.
Enovix Roll-to-Stack Cell Assembly — We have designed proprietary tools, produced for us by precision automated equipment suppliers, which incorporate patented methods and processes to achieve precise laser patterning and high-speed roll-to-stack cell assembly. These tools are “drop-in” replacements for either the wind-and-flatten tools or the cut-and-stack tools in standard Li-ion production processes.
Our precision roll-to-stack assembly has been designed to be a more precise, faster and less expensive version of standard cut-and-stack cell assembly. Instead of cutting or punching, electrodes and separators are laser patterned and stacked into 3D cell architecture. An in-line laser precisely patterns the electrodes and separators, which are then fed directly to a high-speed stacking tool. The laser patterning and high-speed stacking of electrodes and separators in our proprietary 3D cell architecture provides more precise and automatic layer alignment and better spatial efficiency than conventional cut-and-stack cell assembly that typically require slow, optical alignment of each layer.
Battery Packaging and Formation — Our 3D Silicon™ Lithium-ion battery uses the same battery packaging and formation process as a conventional Li-ion battery–with one exception. The first cycle formation efficiency of a graphite anode is about 90% to 95%. The first cycle formation efficiency of a silicon anode is only about 50% to 60%. The pre-lithiation process of the 3D Silicon™ Lithium-ion battery overcomes the first-cycle formation efficiency issue, while preserving all the other benefits of silicon over graphite for anodes.
Our Products
Our product strategy is to develop battery “nodes” that share the same set of active materials and mechanical design and then build batteries at different sizes to accommodate customer requirements based on these nodes. Our product roadmap consists of future nodes at higher levels of energy density based on both materials and design innovation. Our goal is to drive energy density improvements at a faster rate than the Li-ion battery industry’s track record and introduce higher performing battery nodes over time.
We have historically built and sampled standard size batteries that have broad application within specific end markets such as wearables, mobile devices, laptops and AR eyewear. We have also launched custom battery designs with customers that require a unique set of dimensions to accommodate the battery cavity in their device.
In the second quarter of 2022, we began production in Fab-1 of a standard battery cell sized for wearable devices such as a smartwatch and other IoT devices. In 2023, we intend to begin production in Fab-1 of a standard battery cell sized for mobile devices such as smartphones. And by the end of 2023, we intend to install a new higher speed pilot line (“Agility Line”) in Fab-1 to produce custom size batteries more quickly for customer qualification and focus on custom cell development.
Our Competitive Strengths
100% Active Silicon Maximizes Anode Energy Density and Battery Capacity — Conventional Li-ion battery architecture only allows small amounts of silicon to be blended with graphite in the anode, limited by swelling. Our proprietary Enovix 3D cell architecture enables use of silicon without graphite to achieve 100% active silicon anode.
Full-Depth of Discharge Cycle Life — To date, the delivered capacity of 100% active silicon Li-ion batteries comprising low-cost commodity silicon anode materials drastically decreases within the first 100 cycles, thus limiting their market adoption. We have internally built and verified battery cells based on our proprietary 3D cell architecture with an integrated structural constraint capable of 500 cycles, opening mass-market opportunities. With further enhancements, we expect to increase cycle life to 1,000 cycles or more.
Architecture Enables Safety Innovation — Our architecture enables multiple parallel cell-to-busbar connections, which allow us to apply a resistor at the busbar junction that can be utilized to regulate current flux in the event of an internal short. Our BrakeFlowTM system is designed to limit a shorted area from overheating and inhibits thermal runaway. 
Architecture Enables Fast Charge — We have demonstrated a 0-80% state-of-charge in 5.2 minutes and a 0-98% state-of-charge in just under 10 minutes on 0.27Ah test cells. This fast charging is enabled by the fact that heat only has to travel a small distance from the center of our electrodes to the stainless steel constraint on the exterior. 
Leverage Existing Supply Chain — Our cell architecture has been designed to use common, widely available materials as opposed to exotic, highly engineered materials that are commonly devised in the industry to increase energy density. We believe this supplies us with a long-term cost advantage at scale as our manufacturing costs improve. 
Customer Tested in Multiple Form Factors — We have sampled pilot-production cells in four different sizes to over 35 mobile computing customers as part of product development programs. Applications cover a range of portable electronic products, including wearables, mobile handsets and laptop computers.
Mass-Market Commercialization — We have begun to generate product revenue in the portable electronic device market and have shipped batteries from our production line to over 25 OEMs.
Practical Path to EV Market — We will initially validate our silicon anode Li-ion battery technology and production process in the quality-conscious, high-volume portable electronic device market. This will help mitigate technology and production risks as we scale up our production process for the EV market.
Home Grown IP — Unlike many advanced battery startups, which have licensed core technology from government or academic research laboratories, we have developed and own all of our intellectual property. We received our first patents in 2012.
Process Driven Innovation — Our battery development is occurring at the frontier of science, where process innovations are evolving rapidly. Since even minor process changes can have an immense impact on battery performance, the value of co-locating and coupling the research and development (“R&D”) and manufacturing at the same location (Fremont, California) is critical to our technology development strategy.
Research and Development
We conduct R&D at our headquarters facility in Fremont, California. Our R&D programs are focused on driving improvements in the performance and cost of our 3D cell architecture.
Current R&D activities include the following:
Energy Density and Capacity — Increase the energy density and capacity of batteries by increasing the percent by volume of active cathode material.
Cycle Life and Temperature — Improve the cycle life and high and low temperature performance of batteries by developing new electrolyte chemistries.
Safety — Improve battery safety by developing techniques to regulate current flux in the event of a battery short and limit overheating to inhibit thermal runaway. 
Anodes and Cathodes — Develop batteries with next-generation anodes and cathodes that increase energy density.
Cost and Throughput — Develop toolsets and processes to produce batteries with lower cost and higher manufacturing throughput.
Larger (“EV”) Size — Develop electrode and electrolyte chemistries in batteries with silicon anodes which, when scaled up to EV-size cells, meet or exceed EV performance requirements.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
We manufacture Li-ion batteries at our Fremont, California, headquarters. At this location we develop, assemble and test our finished products. We are currently evaluating options for a second manufacturing location (“Fab-2”) to produce our Li-ion cells with the design points of our next generation equipment in mind.
We source materials for our batteries from third party suppliers globally. We have executed master supply agreements with the majority of our suppliers and have identified or are qualifying second sources for many of our battery materials. We seek second sources for materials that are high cost or where a risk to supply has been identified. On long-lead items we intend to keep safety stock on hand to mitigate interruptions to supply.
Intellectual Property 
We operate in an industry in which innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are critical for success. We protect our technology through a variety of means, including through patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws in the U.S. and similar laws in other countries, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements. As of January 1, 2023, we had 45 issued U.S. patents, 96 issued foreign patents, 34 pending U.S. patent applications and 108 pending foreign counterpart patent applications. Our issued patents start expiring in 2028.
We continually assess the need for patent protection for those aspects of our technology that we believe provide significant competitive advantages. A majority of our patents relate to battery architectures, secondary batteries, and related structures and materials. 
With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our secondary battery manufacturing processes involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs, algorithms and procedures. 
We own or have rights to various trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries, including Enovix and the Enovix design mark. We rely on both registration of our marks as well as common law protection where available. 
All of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us. 
We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans. As part of our overall strategy to protect our intellectual property, we may take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology. 
For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, including the above referenced intellectual property proceedings, see Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
The Li-ion battery supplier market is highly competitive, with both large incumbent suppliers and emerging new suppliers.
Prospective competitors of ours include major manufacturers currently supplying the mobile device, EV and BESS industries, mobile device and automotive OEMs and potential new entrants to the industry. Incumbent suppliers of Li-ion batteries include Amperex Technology Ltd., Panasonic Corporation, Samsung SDI, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. and LG-Energy Solution Ltd. They supply conventional Li-ion batteries and in some cases are seeking to develop silicon anode Li-ion batteries. In addition, because of the importance of EVs, many automotive OEMs are researching and investing in advanced Li-ion battery efforts including battery development and production.
There are also several emerging companies investing in developing improvements to conventional Li-ion batteries or new technologies for Li-ion batteries, including silicon anodes and solid-state architectures. Some of these companies have developed relationships with incumbent battery suppliers, auto OEMs and consumer electronics brands. These companies are also exploring new chemistries for electrodes, electrolytes and additives.
Our ability to compete successfully will rely on factors both within and outside our control, including broader economic and industry trends. Factors within our control include driving competitive pricing, cost, energy density, safety and cycle life.
We believe that our ability to compete against this set of competitors will be driven by a number of factors, including product performance, cost, reliability, product roadmap, customer relationships and ability to scale manufacturing. We believe we will compete well on each of these factors based on advanced battery innovation to date and the ability to continue to design, develop and produce higher performing products for the customers served in our targeted markets.
Government Regulation and Compliance
Our business activities are global and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules and regulations. For example, there are various government regulations pertaining to battery safety, transportation of batteries, use of batteries in cars, factory safety, and disposal of hazardous materials. In addition, substantially all of our import and export operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws, export controls, regulations and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or unilateral actions. Further, the countries into which our products are imported or are or will be manufactured may from time to time impose additional duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California has been established as a foreign trade zone through qualification with U.S. Customs, and materials received in a foreign trade zone are not subject to certain U.S. duties or tariffs until the material enters U.S. commerce. While we may benefit from the adoption of a foreign trade zone by reduced duties, deferral of certain duties and tariffs and reduced processing fees, which help us realize a reduction in duty and tariff costs, the operation of our foreign trade zone requires compliance with applicable regulations and continued support of U.S. Customs with respect to the foreign trade zone program. Changes in export controls, tax policy or trade regulations, the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
Privacy and Security Laws
We are or may become subject to stringent and changing U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to privacy and data security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation, fines and penalties, disruptions of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits, loss of customers or sales, and other adverse business consequences.
There are privacy and data security laws to which we are or may in the future be subject. Federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted privacy and data security laws and regulations which may impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) (collectively, “CCPA”) imposes different obligations on covered businesses, including affording privacy rights to consumers, business representatives and employees who are California residents. The CCPA requires covered businesses to provide specific disclosures to California residents in privacy notices and provides such individuals with certain privacy rights to their personal data. The CCPA provides for administrative fines of up to $7,500 per violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. Further, CPRA significantly amended the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights over their personal data and creating a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law. Other states, such as Virginia and Colorado, have also passed comprehensive privacy laws, and similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. These developments further complicate compliance efforts and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom we rely.
Outside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards may govern data privacy and security. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) is wide-ranging in scope and applies to companies established in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The EU GDPR grants certain rights to natural persons physically present in the EEA. Companies subject to the EU GDPR may be required to give data subjects greater control over their personal data, comply with transparency obligations, establish a lawful basis and purpose for data processing, maintain documentation, protect the security and confidentiality of the personal data, notify individuals and/or supervisory authorities of data breaches, and impose privacy and data security requirements onto data processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The EU provides for enforcement actions, and authorizes the imposition of penalties for noncompliance which can result in fines of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4% of 
annual global revenue or private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests.
The EU GDPR, CCPA, and other laws exemplify the obligations our business may have in responding to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data. Our compliance costs and potential liability may increase with this scattered regulatory environment.
Human Capital
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate our people through the granting of equity-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and our success by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. As of January 1, 2023, we employed 335 full-time employees and one part-time employee, based primarily in our headquarters in Fremont CA. 
Culture and Benefits
Our people are truly our greatest asset. We strive to live up to our Core Values every day: integrity, respect, innovation, resilience, excellence and customer focus. Employees carry these Core Values with them on their access badge. Our team at Enovix is comprised of a diverse group of dedicated technicians, engineers, scientists, and business professionals who are all driven to create a better, low-carbon world through innovation in energy storage. We could not be where we are today without the dedication of our workforce, and we prioritize pathways for career development, employee feedback and competitive compensation and benefits packages, employee stock purchase plan, paid time off, team building events and talent development opportunities to ensure we continue to maintain and grow our workforce. 
In 2022, we formally began our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (“DEIA”) program as part of our larger Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) initiative. In our first year, we focused on training and community building. We brought in an expert and rolled out a DEIA training program for our managers which covered 1) an introduction to DEIA 2) understanding bias and the impact of bias at work and 3) how to foster an inclusive culture. Additionally, we kicked off our Women in Leadership quarterly speaker series providing learning and team building opportunities for women at Enovix. We also joined two nonprofit organizations to provide additional training and networking opportunities for employees. 
Building a company where everyone feels that they belong is a priority at Enovix. Our Core Values are reinforced in new hire training and everyday interactions.
