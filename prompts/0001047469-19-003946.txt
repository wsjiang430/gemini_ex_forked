 Item 1.    Business 
   Overview 
         We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to applying our leading expertise in the field of oncolytic immunotherapy to transform the lives of cancer patients. We use our proprietary Immulytic platform to design and develop product candidates that are intended to maximally activate the immune system against cancer. 
         Oncolytic immunotherapy is an emerging class of cancer treatment that exploits the ability of certain viruses to selectively replicate in and directly kill tumors, as well as induce a potent, patient-specific, anti-tumor immune response. Such oncolytic, or "cancer killing," viruses have the potential to generate an immune response targeted to an individual patient's particular set of tumor antigens, including neo-antigens that are uniquely present in tumors. Our product candidates incorporate multiple mechanisms of action into a practical "off-the-shelf" approach that is intended to maximize the immune response against a patient's cancer and to offer significant advantages over personalized vaccine approaches. We believe that the bundling of multiple approaches for the treatment of cancer into single therapies will simplify the development path of our product candidates, while also improving patient outcomes at a lower cost to the healthcare system than the use of multiple different drugs. 
         The foundation of our Immulytic platform consists of a proprietary, engineered strain of herpes simplex virus 1, or HSV-1, that has been "armed" with a fusogenic protein intended to substantially increase anti-tumor activity. Our platform enables us to incorporate various genes whose expression is intended to augment the inherent properties of HSV-1 to both directly destroy tumor cells and induce an anti-tumor immune response. We believe our lead product candidate, RP1, will be effective at killing tumors and inducing immunogenic, or immune-stimulating, tumor cell death and that it will be highly synergistic with immune checkpoint blockade therapies. 
         We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial with RP1 in approximately 150 patients. We have completed enrollment of the Phase 1 dose rising part of this clinical trial in which we are assessing the safety and tolerability of RP1 administered alone in 22 patients with mixed advanced solid tumor types, and following the review of the data by the Safety Review Committee, or SRC, have determined the dose regimen to be administered in the Phase 2 part of this clinical trial. We are completing enrollment of a Phase 1 expansion cohort of approximately 12 patients in which we are assessing the safety and tolerability of RP1 administered in combination with an anti-PD1 therapy at the determined Phase 2 dose level. One patient with microsatellite instability high cancers, or MSI-H/dMMR, remains to be enrolled in the expansion cohort. 
         The Phase 2 part of this clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of RP1 in combination with an anti-PD1 therapy in four cohorts of approximately 30 patients with melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers, bladder cancer and MSI-H/dMMR. Following SRC review of the Phase 1 data to date, including data from the expansion cohort receiving RP1 with anti-PD1 therapy, we have opened enrollment in the United States and the United Kingdom of the melanoma, bladder cancer, and non-melanoma skin cancer Phase 2 cohorts, and will open enrollment of the MSI-H-dMMR Phase 2 cohort after a final evaluable MSI-H/dMMR patient has been enrolled in the Phase 1 expansion cohort without safety concerns. In the Phase 2 part of the clinical trial, we are also evaluating efficacy under the clinical trial protocol, primarily on the basis of the proportion of patients who have a response within each tumor type cohort. Responses are either defined as a partial response (a 30% or greater reduction in tumor size) or a complete response (a complete eradication of the disease). We then intend to analyze each cohort's data to determine the indications that merit progressing into further clinical development.

           This Phase 1/2 clinical trial is being conducted as a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, under which it has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to, and is supplying at no cost, its anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab, for use in combination with RP1 in this clinical trial. BMS has no further development-related obligations under this collaboration. 
         We have also entered into a collaboration agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, under which we intend to conduct clinical development of our product candidates in combination with cemiplimab, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Regeneron. For each clinical trial conducted under this collaboration, Regeneron will fund one-half of the clinical trial costs, supply cemiplimab at no cost, and grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to cemiplimab for use in the clinical trial. The first planned clinical trial under this collaboration is a randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of RP1 in combination with cemiplimab, versus cemiplimab alone, in approximately 240 patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC. Initial study site activation is currently underway in the United States and Australia, with study initiation expected in August 2019. If compelling clinical data are generated demonstrating the benefits of the combined treatment, we believe the data from this Phase 2 clinical trial could support a filing with regulatory authorities for marketing approval. 
         We are also developing additional product candidates, RP2 and RP3, built on our Immulytic platform, that are further engineered to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and intended to address additional tumor types. RP2 has been engineered to express an antibody-like molecule that blocks the activity of CTLA-4, a protein that inhibits the immune response to tumors. RP3 is engineered with the intent of not only blocking the activity of CTLA-4, but also to further stimulate an anti-tumor response through activation of the immune co-stimulatory pathways through expression of the ligands for CD40 and 4-1BB. 
         We intend to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial with RP2 alone and in combination with nivolumab in the third quarter of 2019, pending our response to queries from the FDA in the United States and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, in the United Kingdom regarding certain Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, or CMC aspects of the clinical trial. These queries, which we received from the FDA and MHRA in February 2019 and May 2019, respectively, were in response to our submission of pre-IND questions to the FDA and the CTA, respectively. Our responses to these queries, including with respect to the FDA, the development of a further analytical data, have delayed the intended opening of this Phase 1 clinical trial beyond the second quarter of 2019 as we originally intended. The clinical trial is now expected to initiate, initially in the UK, in the third quarter of 2019. The Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 will also be conducted as a collaboration with BMS, under which it has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to, and will supply at no cost, nivolumab, for use in combination with RP2. BMS has no further development-related obligations under this collaboration. 
         We intend to file an IND and/or foreign equivalents for RP3 and, assuming regulatory clearance, enter clinical development during 2020. IND enabling studies are currently underway. 
         Our product candidates are administered by direct injection into solid tumors, guided either visually or by ultrasound or other imaging methods. We believe that direct injection maximizes virus-mediated tumor cell death, provides the most efficient delivery of virus-encoded immune activating proteins into the tumor with the goal of activating systemic immunity, and limits the systemic toxicities that could be associated with intravenous administration. Activation of systemic immunity through local administration can lead to the induction of tumor responses in tumors which have not themselves been injected, which is known as an "abscopal" effect.

     Our strategy 
         Our goal is to create the leading oncolytic immunotherapy company that discovers, develops and commercializes next-generation products with multiple mechanisms of action for the treatment of a broad range of solid tumor types. Key elements of our strategy include the following: 
  Advance the development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our lead product candidate, RP1.    We are advancing two clinical trials for RP1. We are currently initiating a randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of RP1 in combination with cemiplimab, versus cemiplimab alone, in approximately 240 patients with CSCC, which we have designed to potentially support product registration. In addition, we are currently conducting the Phase 2 part of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RP1 in combination with nivolumab, enrollment of which is currently open for three of the four intended tumor type cohorts. We then intend to analyze each cohort's data to determine the indications that merit further clinical development. 
  Initiate the clinical development of and obtain regulatory approval for RP2, our next product candidate.    We have engineered RP2, which is based on RP1 but additionally expresses an anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like protein, to target tumor types that do not respond to single-agent immune checkpoint blockade therapies and patients who have not responded to or who have progressed on anti-PD-1/L1 therapy. In the third quarter of 2019, we plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 alone and in combination with nivolumab following receipt of regulatory approval to proceed in the United States and/or United Kingdom. Pending the results of this Phase 1 clinical trial, we intend to initiate separate Phase 2 clinical trials in individual tumor types, currently intended to include triple negative breast cancer and two additional indications, which we expect to define in the second half of 2019. 
  Leverage our Immulytic platform to build a portfolio of product candidates that target a range of immune mechanisms and progress these product candidates into the clinic.    We plan to utilize our Immulytic platform to develop additional product that express further combinations of proteins aimed at activating multiple immune mechanisms for the treatment of a broad range of solid tumor types. Our intended goal in the coming years is to introduce one product candidate into the clinic each year. Current focus, however, is on the development of RP1, RP2 and RP3 rather than expansion of the pipeline beyond these product candidates. 
  Apply our extensive expertise to establish, equip, and operate our own in-house manufacturing facility.    We intend to establish, equip, and operate our own manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts for multi-product current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, manufacturing. We expect our facility to be ready to produce clinical-grade material during the first half of 2020 and ultimately to be able to support commercial product launch. 
  Retain significant economic and commercial rights to our product candidates in key geographic areas.    We intend to retain rights in the United States for our product candidates and to develop an oncology-focused commercial organization. When economically attractive, we intend to evaluate and enter into development and marketing agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners for geographic areas in which we are unlikely to pursue development and commercialization on our own. 
   Immuno-oncology background and limitations of existing therapies 
         Cancer is a broad group of diseases in which normal cells are transformed into a state of rapid and uncontrolled cell division, typically forming tumors. Cancer originates from a particular tissue in the body, such as the lung or skin, and often spreads, or metastasizes, as the disease progresses. Tumors are comprised of multiple cell types, including cancerous cells and immune cells. The composition and the type of tumor dictate the aggressiveness of a particular cancer, its susceptibility to treatment, and ultimately the outcome for the patient. A promising new approach to cancer treatment, which is the 
 7

   subject of significant ongoing drug development activity, is to activate the immune system against cancer. 
         The immune system contains many different cell types that fall into two general categories, cells of the innate immune system and cells of the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system is a first-line, ubiquitous, non-specific defense mechanism aimed at combating elements that the body views as foreign, particularly microbial pathogens and parasites, but also tumor cells. After the innate immune system is activated, an adaptive immune response is triggered that is specific to particular proteins, known as antigens. The adaptive immune system is flexible and can evolve. Importantly, it has the capacity for immune memory, or the ability to be recalled into action if the same foreign antigen is detected in the body in the future. Activation of both the innate and adaptive components of the immune system is believed to be essential for the induction of an effective anti-cancer immune response. 
         Immune checkpoints are key mechanisms of the adaptive immune system that function to inhibit immune responses and, in particular, to prevent the induction of autoimmunity. In the cancer setting, tumors can hijack these immune checkpoints such that the tumors become protected from the effects of anti-cancer immunity. This enables tumors to continue growing without or with reduced immune interference, even if an anti-tumor immune response had been initiated. Additional immune checkpoints inhibit the initial induction of an immune response, rather than subsequently protecting the tumor from a previously established immune response. 
         Checkpoint inhibitor therapies block these negative regulators of the immune system with the intent of either rendering tumors susceptible to immune attack and/or increasing the potency of the anti-tumor immune response that is generated. This approach to cancer therapy has the potential to result in long-lasting anti-cancer effects in certain patients with certain tumor types. To date, multiple immune checkpoint blockade products have been approved in a number of cancer indications, and there are numerous other related drug candidates in preclinical and clinical development. Market researchers forecast that immuno-oncology treatments will grow to over $25 billion a year in sales globally by 2022. 
         While immune checkpoint blockade has been a transformational treatment for many patients with cancer, the majority of patients do not respond to current treatments. This is because checkpoint blockade therapies require a pre-existing immune response to a patient's tumor and that the tumors be "inflamed," or "hot." Because many patients do not have an ongoing pre-existing anti-tumor immune response, which is often referred to as a tumor being immunologically "cold," only a minority of patients respond to checkpoint blockade therapies alone. We therefore believe that the ability to effectively convert "cold" tumors to "hot" would substantially increase the response rates and the types of tumors which are susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. 
   Our approachOncolytic immunotherapy 
         Our product candidates are designed to induce a robust immune response against a patient's cancer and turn immunologically "cold" tumors "hot." To achieve this objective, we use oncolytic immunotherapies that combine multiple mechanisms of action in a single product candidate. We believe our product candidates will initiate or enhance an immune response in patients with no or minimal pre-existing cancer immunity, including to tumor neo-antigens, and thereby increase the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade therapies. 
         Oncolytic immunotherapy is the treatment of cancer with viruses that selectively replicate in tumors as compared to normal tissue, thereby killing the virus-infected tumor cells. In addition to this direct oncolytic killing of cancer cells, the presence of the virus and the generation of immune-stimulating tumor cell death triggers both innate and adaptive immune responses that result in further tumor destruction, intended to result in the establishment of lasting anti-tumor immunity. 
 8

          
        Our product candidates are intended to act at several key points in the pathways involved in the initiation of an immune response. Following direct injection into tumors, our viruses replicate in cancer cells and then lyse, or break them open, releasing tumor antigens, including neo-antigens specific to the patient, which could otherwise be hidden from the immune system. This process of necrotic cell death releases intra-cellular markers of "danger," the danger associated molecular patterns, or DAMPs, while the virus produces pathogen associated markers of danger, or PAMPs. These trigger various pathways of the innate immune system, including the STING pathway and pathways mediated through toll-like receptors, or TLRs, each resulting in the production of interferon. Innate immune activation would be expected to itself provide anti-tumor effects, as interferon activates natural killer cells which can destroy tumor cells. Innate immune activation would also be expected to help to trigger adaptive anti-cancer immunity, in which antigen presenting cells, or APCs, are attracted to the injected tumor. APCs internalize cancer antigens, including neo-antigens, and traffic back to the draining lymph nodes where they present the antigens to T cells. These are then primed to proliferate and disperse systemically to seek and destroy cancer cells with the same antigen profile throughout the body with the aim of destroying distant tumor deposits. 
         To further augment these intended effects, our oncolytic immunotherapies are intended to genetically encode and express multiple potent cell-killing and immune-stimulating proteins in the tumorin other words, our oncolytic immunotherapies are "armed" with these therapeutic genes. 
         We believe that our ability to incorporate multiple mechanisms of action into a practical "off-the-shelf" approach to initiating or enhancing an anti-tumor immune response, including to neo-antigens, will offer significant advantages over the various approaches to immune activation that are currently in development, including personalized vaccine treatments. Tumor neo-antigens are uniquely present in tumors as compared to normal tissue because they result from the genetic changes that occur as cancer develops. Unlike the antigens present in normal tissue, the immune system sees neo-antigens as foreign. As a result, the immune system is able to mount an immune response to tumor neo-antigens in the same way that it would to the antigens contained in disease-causing micro-organisms, which the immune system also sees as foreign. Researchers believe immune responses to tumor neo-antigens are particularly important in providing the patient's immune system the ability to combat cancer, and as a consequence various "personalized vaccine" approaches to generating immune responses to tumor neo-antigens are in development. These approaches are generally both expensive and time consuming because a vaccine cannot be designed and manufactured until a tumor biopsy is taken and analyzed in the laboratory to identify the mutated tumor antigens that will be targeted by the treatment. We believe that our approach may also offer significant advantages over other approaches to anti-cancer immune activation that only target a single pathway of the immune system, as is the case with most of the other immuno-oncology therapies currently under development. Importantly, our product candidates are intended to maximally activate an immune response against cancer, the missing element needed to allow anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy to treat more patients and tumor types, unlike some other therapies which are intended to act by blocking additional defense mechanisms against an anti-tumor immune response once it has been initiated. 
   Our Immulytic platform 
         The foundation of our oncolytic immunotherapy product candidates, which we call our Immulytic platform, consists of a proprietary strain of HSV-1 that we have engineered to replicate selectively in tumors and to express a fusogenic glycoprotein, a protein that triggers the fusion of the membranes between cells. HSV-1 is both highly cell lytic and inflammatory, and also has a large carrying capacity, which makes it possible to incorporate multiple genes encoding therapeutic proteins. We believe our combination of HSV-1 with the expression of the fusogenic glycoprotein increases the natural ability of HSV-1 to kill tumor cells and to induce an anti-tumor immune response. The fusogenic functionality of our product candidates is intended not only to increase the number of tumor cells that are killed, but 
 9

   also to cause highly immunogenic death of tumor cells. We believe that these factors will increase the potency of the systemic anti-tumor immune response that is generated by our product candidates. With the intention of amplifying the anti-tumor response further, we have also engineered our product candidates to express in tumors a range of additional, potent, immune activating genes encoding therapeutic proteins. Our lead product candidate, RP1, serves as the base for the development of these additional oncolytic immunotherapies expressing further therapeutic proteins. In addition to RP1, our current pipeline products are RP2 and RP3. 
         We believe that our intended step-wise development approach from RP1 through RP3 reduces clinical risk, as we will be able to study the safety profile of each therapeutic protein prior to moving to the next product candidate with an additional therapeutic protein that is intended to provide more potent anti-tumor immune effects. 
   Lead product candidate: RP1 
         Our lead product candidate, RP1, is a selectively replicating version of HSV-1 that expresses GALV-GP R(-) and human GM-CSF. RP1 has the following properties:
 

 We have deleted the ICP34.5-encoding gene, which enables tumor-selective virus replication; 
 We have deleted the ICP47-encoding gene, which is intended to prevent the inhibition of the antigen presentation pathway otherwise caused by
ICP47 binding to the transporter associated with antigen presentation. ICP47 deletion is also intended to result in the increased and earlier expression of the HSV-1 US11 gene by placing the HSV-1
US11 gene under the control of ICP47 promoter. This increases virus replication in tumors without reducing tumor-selectivity; and 
 We have inserted the sequences for GALV-GP R(-) and human GM-CSF, which results in the expression of these therapeutic proteins with the
intention of increasing both the direct tumor cell killing and the potency of the anti-tumor immune response that is induced. 

         We are developing RP1 for use in combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, particularly therapies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1. We believe that the robust release of tumor antigens and the highly immunogenic tumor cell death intended to be caused by RP1 will further increase the synergy previously seen between oncolytic viruses and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. 
   Preclinical results 
         In one of our preclinical experiments, tumors were induced in both the left and right flanks of rats. RP1 was then injected into the tumors in only the right flanks. We observed destruction not only of the injected tumors in the right flanks, but also of the large un-injected tumors in the left flanks of 70% of the treated rats. When formulation buffer with no RP1 was injected into "control" rats, no impact on the growth of the injected or un-injected tumors was observed. This effect of RP1 in both injected and un-injected tumors provides support for the potent systemic, or "abscopal," effect of RP1. 
   Phase 1/2 clinical trial in multiple tumor types 
         We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial with RP1 in approximately 150 patients. We have completed enrollment of the Phase 1 dose rising part of this clinical trial in which we are assessing the safety and tolerability of RP1 administered alone in 22 patients with mixed advanced solid tumor types and, following the review of the data by the SRC, have determined the dose regimen to be administered in the Phase 2 part of this clinical trial. We are completing enrollment of a Phase 1 expansion cohort of approximately 12 patients in which we are assessing the safety and efficacy of RP1 administered in combination with nivolumab. One patient with MSI-H/dMMR remains to be enrolled in the expansion cohort. We have designed the Phase 1 part of the trial to provide insights on the 
 10

   effects of RP1 on tumors, including necrosis, inflammation and erythema, the biodistribution of RP1 in the blood, saliva and mucosa, and the impact of RP1 administration on anti-HSV-1 antibody responses. For the patients in the Phase 1 part of the trial who also receive nivolumab, we are assessing certain biomarkers indicative of immune activation in tumor biopsies. These include the infiltration of T cells, expression of PD-L1, and the presence of an "inflamed gene signature," each of which would indicate ongoing immune activation. 
         The Phase 2 part of this clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of RP1 in combination with an anti-PD1 therapy in four cohorts of approximately 30 patients with melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers, bladder cancer and MSI-H/dMMR. Following SRC review of the Phase 1 data to date, we have opened enrollment in the United States and the United Kingdom of the melanoma, bladder cancer, and non-melanoma skin cancer Phase 2 cohorts, and will open enrollment of the MSI-H-dMMR Phase 2 cohort after a final evaluable MSI-H/dMMR patient has been enrolled in the Phase 1 expansion cohort without safety concerns. In the Phase 2 part of the clinical trial, we are also evaluating efficacy under the clinical trial protocol, primarily on the basis of the proportion of patients who have a response within each tumor type cohort. Responses are either defined as a partial response (a 30% or greater reduction in tumor size) or a complete response (a complete eradication of the disease). We then intend to analyze each cohort's data to determine the indications that merit progressing into further clinical development. We have chosen the tumor types in the Phase 2 part of the clinical trial because they have shown that they have some level of underlying responsiveness to treatment with immune checkpoint blockade therapies but for which we believe considerable unmet medical need remains. We intend to expand the number of patients treated and/or add a control arm for each cohort where we see promising signs of efficacy, either as part of the same clinical trial or as separate clinical trials, as a means to gather more definitive data in support of the clinical benefit of the combination of RP1 and nivolumab in these respective tumor types. We believe that the expanded clinical trials can be designed to support a filing with regulatory authorities for marketing approval. 
         This Phase 1/2 clinical trial is being conducted as a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, under which it has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to, and is supplying at no cost, its anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab, for use in combination with RP1 in this clinical trial. BMS has no further development-related obligations under this collaboration. 
   Phase 2 clinical trial in CSCC 
         We are also planning to initiate a randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of RP1 in combination with cemiplimab, versus cemiplimab alone, in approximately 240 patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC. Initial study site activation is currently underway in the United States and Australia, with study initiation expected in August 2019. This clinical trial will be conducted in collaboration with Regeneron. If compelling clinical data are generated demonstrating the benefits of the combined treatment, we believe the data from this trial could support a filing with regulatory authorities for marketing approval. 
   Product candidate pipeline 
         We are also developing additional product candidates, RP2 and RP3, built on our Immulytic platform, that are further engineered to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and intended to address additional tumor types. RP2 has been engineered to express an antibody-like molecule that blocks the activity of CTLA-4, a protein that inhibits the immune response to tumors. RP3 is engineered with the intent of not only blocking the activity of CTLA-4, but also to further stimulate an anti-tumor response through activation of the immune co-stimulatory pathways through expression of the ligands for CD40 and 4-1BB. 
 11

     Pipeline product candidate: RP2 
         We have designed our RP2 product candidate to express an anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like protein in order to block the inhibition of the immune response otherwise caused by CTLA-4. We believe that RP2 will offer advantages compared with current CTLA-4 approaches, including ipilimumab. By expressing anti-CTLA-4 only locally in the tumor and draining lymph nodes, we believe that activity will be retained, but that toxicity will be reduced. We intend that our RP2 product candidate will be used in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, which we believe will result in both synergy with the oncolytic virus and the expression of the anti-CTLA-4 in the tumor. 
         We intend to administer RP2 in combination with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy in tumor types with poor responsiveness to anti-PD-1/L1 therapy alone, and in patients who have not responded to or who have progressed on prior anti-PD-1/L1 therapy. We currently expect to include patients with triple negative breast cancer and two further indications in our initial clinical trial with RP2, and we expect to determine which tumor types to target in the second half of 2019. 
   Preclinical results 
         We have conducted preclinical tests comparing RP1 and RP2 to determine the effect of expressing the anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like protein and have observed an enhanced effect with RP2. In one of these preclinical experiments, tumors were induced in both the left and right flanks of mice. Either RP1 or RP2 was then injected into the tumors in only the right flanks. We observed enhanced destruction of tumors with RP2 as compared to RP1, particularly of the un-injected tumors. In this experiment only a low dose of virus was used such that with RP1 un-injected tumors only partially responded to the treatment. This was to allow the potential benefits of anti-CTLA-4 expression to be observed. 
         In a further experiment with RP2 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, we demonstrated that the responses in 15 mice in which tumors had been eradicated were durable and that all but one of these mice were protected against re-challenge with tumor cells, demonstrating that memory immune responses had been induced. 
   Planned Phase 1 clinical trial 
         We intend to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial with RP2 alone and in combination with nivolumab in the third quarter of 2019, pending our response to queries from the FDA in the United States and the MHRA in the United Kingdom regarding certain CMC aspects of this Phase 1 clinical trial with RP2, as described below. Our responses to these queries have delayed the intended opening of this Phase 1 clinical trial with RP2 beyond the second quarter of 2019 as we originally intended. This Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 will also be conducted as a collaboration with BMS, under which it has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to, and will supply at no cost, nivolumab, for use in combination with. BMS has no further development-related obligations under this collaboration. 
   Regulatory status 
         In the United Kingdom, prior to filing a CTA, we participated in a pre-CTA meeting with the MHRA in December 2018. We subsequently filed our CTA with the MHRA in February 2019 and received a response with a number of queries in March 2019. We responded to the MHRA in April 2019 and in May 2019 the MHRA notified us that further CMC information was required. In June 2019, the MHRA provided clarification with respect to the required information, which related to the provision of additional comparability data between the intended clinical batches and those used in non-clinical studies. We expect that, after submitting the requested data to the MHRA, we will initiate the Phase 1 clinical trial with RP2 alone and in combination with nivolumab in the third quarter of 2019, rather than the second quarter as originally planned. 
 12

           In the United States, we submitted pre-IND questions to the FDA in January 2019 and the FDA responded in February 2019 with a number of CMC related queries, including indicating the need for further analytical data to be generated and that further justification was required for certain aspects of the intended clinical trial protocol. We are currently addressing these queries and expect to file an IND with the FDA once they have been addressed. 
   Pipeline product candidate: RP3 
         We have designed our RP3 product candidate to express immune-activating proteins that stimulate T cells, in addition to anti-CTLA-4 and GALV-GP R(-). These immune activating proteins are the ligands for two immune co-stimulatory pathways responsible for T cell proliferation and/or activation, the CD40 and 4-1BB pathways. Pre-clinical studies with RP3 are currently underway, with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, toxicology and biodistribution studies expected in the second half of 2019. As with RP2, we intend to study RP3 in indications that are less responsive to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. We expect to bring RP3 into clinical development in 2020. 
   Preclinical results 
         We have conducted preclinical tests to assess the benefit of expressing immune co-stimulatory pathway ligands, and have observed an enhanced effect associated with the expression of these proteins as compared to RP1. In one of these preclinical experiments, tumors were induced in both the left and right flanks of mice. Either RP1 or versions of RP1 additionally expressing the ligands which activate CD40, 4-1BB or OX40 were then injected into the tumors in only the right flanks. We observed enhanced destruction of tumors with the co-stimulatory pathway ligand expressing viruses as compared to RP1, particularly of the un-injected tumors. In this experiment only a low dose of virus was used such that with RP1 un-injected tumors only partially responded to the treatment. This was to allow the potential benefits of co-stimulatory pathway ligand expression to be observed. After evaluation of our own data relating to the activity of immune co-stimulatory pathway activating ligands, as well as external clinical data targeting these pathways, we chose to incorporate CD40 ligand and 4-1BB ligand into RP3 
   Intellectual property 
         We believe our rights under issued patents, if obtained, and patent applications will provide a competitive advantage. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing upon our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
         For the core technology in our Immulytic platform and each of our product candidates, we have filed five patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, and four U.S. provisional applications. Four of these PCT applications have entered the national phase and are pending in a range of countries, and one is still in the international phase. None of our PCT-derived patent applications or U.S. provisional applications have been granted by a patent office. Early stage examination has started only in connection with the European national phase applications. 
         The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits 
 13

   patent term restoration of a portion of the patent term lost during the U.S. clinical development and FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under clinical development in the United States and the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, and if and when patents grant, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. 
         We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors, as well as physical security of our premises and our information technology systems. 
   Competition 
         The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary rights. We compete in the highly competitive markets that address cancer and face significant competition from many sources, including pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and drug development resources than we do. Large biopharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive experience in clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs and biologicals. These companies also have significantly greater research capabilities than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies or universities and research institutions. 
         Our competitors fall primarily into the following groups of treatment:
 

 traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, surgery, radiation and targeted therapies; 
 approved immunotherapy antibodies and immunotherapy antibodies in clinical trials; 
 oncolytic immunotherapies, including T-Vec and other oncolytic immunotherapies in clinical trials; 
 therapies aimed at activating innate immunity such as those targeting STING and TLRs; 
 cancer vaccines including personalized vaccines and those targeting tumor neo-antigens; and 
 cell-based therapies, such as CAR-T, T cell receptor-based, and NK cell therapies. 

         Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are easier to administer or are less expensive alone or in combination with other therapies than any products that we may develop alone or in combination with other therapies, especially if these get to market sooner than our products. These third parties also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. 
 14

           Our oncolytic product candidates, if and when marketed, will compete with a number of drugs that are currently marketed or in development that also target cancer but that utilize a different mechanism of action. To compete effectively with these agents, our product candidates will need to demonstrate advantages that lead to improved clinical efficacy and safety compared with these competitors. At the same time, however, we believe that our oncolytic product candidates, if and when ultimately marketed, would likely be used principally in combination with checkpoint blockade therapies in addition to existing cancer therapies, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and other biological therapies such as antibodies targeting particular surface receptors. We therefore believe that our product candidates, if and when marketed, would largely complement rather than compete directly with these existing treatment options. 
         We do, however, expect to face direct and increasing competition from a number of companies that are also seeking to develop cancer therapies based on oncolytic viruses and other ways to prime the immune system, including neo-antigen vaccination. We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend, among other things, on our ability to:
 

 expeditiously advance the development of our product candidates; 
 design, enroll patients in and successfully complete appropriate clinical trials in a timely fashion; 
 gain regulatory approval for our product candidates in their first indications as well as further indications; 
 establish collaborations and partnerships for the development and marketing of our product candidates; 
 commercialize our product candidates successfully, including convincing physicians, insurers and third-party payors of the safety and efficacy
of our product candidates over currently approved therapies; 
 secure and protect intellectual property rights based on our innovations; and 
 manufacture or otherwise obtain and sell commercial quantities of future products to the market. 

   Manufacturing and suppliers 
         We have established an operations leadership team with extensive experience in manufacturing biologics based on viruses, including oncolytic products and gene therapy products, and in the construction, validation, approval and operation of facilities designed to manufacture biologics. Our team has already developed a robust and reproducible manufacturing process for our product candidates. We are also developing our product candidates for maximum practicality of use compared with some other oncolytic immunotherapies; in particular, our product candidates do not require refrigeration at 700 Celsius at clinical sites. 
         To date, our third-party contract manufacturer in Europe has been responsible for sourcing raw materials for use in the manufacture, in accordance with cGMP, of our product candidates for use in our planned early clinical trials. We currently use fetal bovine sera, a commonly used growth supplement, in the initial growth of the mammalian cells used in the production of our viral product candidates and a recombinant human protein to increase the stability of our drug formulation. We are in the process of developing our raw material supply chain for our product candidates as part of the process of establishing our own manufacturing facility and intend to enter into commercial supply, collaboration or similar agreements prior to conducting advanced clinical trials. 
         We have leased an approximately 63,000 square-foot facility in Framingham, Massachusetts, where we plan to operate our own in-house manufacturing facility in order to secure supplies for pivotal 
 15

   studies and commercial launch. Construction is underway and planned to be substantially complete by the end of 2019. This facility is intended to give us control over key aspects of the supply chain for our products and product candidates. We are designing this facility to allow us to produce two different products in parallel and several different products in the same facility. 
         By establishing our own manufacturing facility, we aim to minimize or eliminate our reliance on contract manufacturing organizations, which typically have limited capacity at commercial scale and quality. We believe that having control over the whole manufacturing process will allow us to reduce cycle times and cost of goods for commercial production and to shorten overall timelines for new product candidates in our development pipeline, as well as help us to develop drug formulations or presentations to simplify distribution and/or administration of future oncolytic immunotherapies. We also believe that having a dedicated manufacturing facility will allow us to optimize commercial-scale processes and to develop a suitable workforce capable of supporting market launch. 
   Sales and marketing 
         None of our product candidates has been approved for sale. If and when our product candidates receive marketing approval, we intend to commercialize them on our own in the United States and potentially with pharmaceutical or biotechnology partners in other geographies. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercialization capabilities and have no experience as a company doing such activities. However, we intend to build the necessary capabilities and infrastructure over time following the advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the opportunity and the size of the commercial infrastructure required will influence our commercialization plans and decision making. 
   Collaborations 
   BMS 
         On February 26, 2018, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with BMS. Pursuant to the agreement, BMS will provide to us, at no cost, nivolumab, its anti-PD-1 therapy, for use in combination with RP1 in our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Under the agreement, we will sponsor, fund and conduct the clinical trial in accordance with an agreed-upon protocol. Under the agreement, BMS has granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, royalty-free license (with a right to sublicense) under its intellectual property to use nivolumab in the clinical trial and has agreed to supply nivolumab, at its cost and for no charge to us, for use in the clinical trial. Both parties will own the study data produced in the clinical trial, other than study data related solely to nivolumab, which will belong solely to BMS, or study data related solely to RP1, which will belong solely to us. 
         Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will remain in effect until (a) the completion of the clinical trial, (b) all related clinical trial data have been delivered to both parties and (c) the completion of any statistical analyses and bioanalyses contemplated by the clinical trial protocol or any analysis otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The agreement may be terminated by either party (i) in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, (ii) in the event the other party is insolvent or in bankruptcy proceedings or (iii) for safety reasons. Upon termination, the licenses granted to us to use nivolumab in the clinical trial will terminate. The agreement contains representations, warranties, undertakings and indemnities customary for a transaction of this nature. 
 16

          
  Regeneron 
         On May 29, 2018, we entered into a Master Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Regeneron. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to undertake one or more clinical trials with Regeneron for the administration of our product candidates in combination with cemiplimab, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Regeneron, across multiple solid tumor types, the first of which is intended to be our planned Phase 2 clinical trial of RP1 in patients with CSCC. Each clinical trial will be conducted pursuant to an agreed study plan which, among other things, will identify the name of the sponsor and which party will manage the particular study, and include the protocol, the budget and a schedule of clinical obligations. The first study plan related to the Phase 2 clinical trial has been agreed. 
         Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, each party granted the other party a non-exclusive license of their respective intellectual property and agreed to contribute the necessary resources to fulfill their respective obligations, in each case, under the terms of the agreed study plans. Development costs of a particular clinical trial will be split equally. The agreement contains certain covenants that restrict us from entering into a third-party arrangement with respect to the use of our product candidates in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy and that restrict Regeneron from entering into a third-party arrangement with respect to the use of cemiplimab in combination with an HSV-1 based product, in each case, for the treatment of a tumor type that is the subject of a clinical trial to which the covenants apply. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in a future study plan, these covenants are only applicable to our planned Phase 2 clinical trial in CSCC and expire upon the one-year anniversary of the commencement of the applicable study plan. 
         The agreement may be terminated by either party if (i) there is no active study plan for which a final study report has not been completed, (ii) the parties have not entered into a study plan for an additional clinical trial within a period of time after the delivery of the most recent final study report or (iii) in the event of a material breach. The agreement contains representations, warranties, undertakings and indemnities customary for a transaction of this nature. 
   Regulatory matters 
         Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import, and export of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. In addition, manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products participating in Medicaid and Medicare are required to comply with mandatory price reporting, discount, and rebate requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
   FDA and EU regulation 
         In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Services Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

 completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in compliance with GLP regulations; 
 submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin at United States clinical trial sites; 

 17

   

 approval by an IRB for each clinical site, or centrally, before each trial may be initiated; 
 adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed product candidate for its
intended use, performed in accordance with GCPs; 
 development of manufacturing processes to ensure the product candidate's identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency; 
 submission to the FDA of a BLA; 
 satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the products are produced to assess
compliance with current cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the therapeutics' identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency as well as
satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites and selected clinical investigators to determine GCP compliance; and 
 FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use. 

   Preclinical studies and IND submission 
         The testing and approval process of product candidates requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Satisfaction of the FDA's pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, and product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Such studies must generally be conducted in accordance with the FDA's GLPs. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial at a United States investigational site with a product candidate, an IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and proposed clinical study protocols among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. 
         An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, notifies the applicant of safety concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 
   Clinical trials 
         Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with federal regulations and GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, as well as review and approval of the study by an IRB. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial, and any subsequent protocol amendments, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each study site participating in the clinical trial or a central IRB 
 18

   must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, informed consent forms, and communications to study subjects before a study commences at that site. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, and whether the planned human subject protections are adequate. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be added to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRB for approval. If a product candidate is being investigated for multiple intended indications, separate INDs may also be required. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must also be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events or other significant safety information is found. 
         The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements or if the trial poses an unexpected serious harm to subjects. The FDA or an IRB may also impose conditions on the conduct of a clinical trial. Clinical trial sponsors may also choose to discontinue clinical trials as a result of risks to subjects, a lack of favorable results, or changing business priorities. 
         Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website. Manufacturers or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access requests. 
         Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial that regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of the trial. This group may also review interim data to assess the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. This group receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise the sponsor to halt the clinical trial if it determined there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or on other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. 
         The manufacture of investigational biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to current cGMP requirements. Investigational biologics and active ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA. Further, the export of investigational products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as United States export requirements under the FDCA. 
         In general, for purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. 
 

 Phase 1Trials are initially conducted in healthy human volunteers or subjects with the target disease or condition and test
the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. If possible, Phase 1 trials may
also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness. 
 Phase 2Controlled trials are conducted in limited subject populations with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the
effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication or indications, identify optimal dosages, dosage tolerance and schedule, possible adverse effects and safety risks, and expanded
evidence of safety. 

 19

   

 Phase 3These adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are undertaken in expanded subject populations, generally at
geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to generate enough data to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the
overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Typically, two Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for product approval.
Under some limited circumstances, however, the FDA may approve a BLA based upon a single Phase 3 clinical trials. 

         Additional kinds of data may also help to support a BLA, such as patient experience data. 
         Further, under certain circumstances, manufacturers and sponsors of investigational biopharmaceutical product candidates can provide access to the product candidates to certain qualifying patients outside of clinical trials. For instance, under the FDA's expanded access program, with FDA approval and subject to certain requirements, sponsors may provide access to product candidates to patients with serious or immediately life threatening diseases or conditions for which there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy, provided that the potential patient benefit justifies the risks, the risks are not unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be treated, and the provision of the product candidate for the requested use will not interfere with clinical investigations. The specific expanded access criteria and requirements depend on the number of expanded access patients. Sponsors and investigators of expanded access programs must still comply with the FDA's clinical trial guidelines and are subject to protection regulations. Federal and state laws in the United States, referred to as right to try laws, also establish a separate mechanism through which certain patients with life threatening diseases or conditions, who have exhausted all approved treatment options and are unable to participate in a clinical trial, may request access to investigational product candidates that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial. While certain criteria must be met for a patient to be eligible for access to product candidates under right to try laws, these laws do not require the FDA to approve the use of the product candidate and do not require compliance with the majority of the FDA's clinical trial regulations. 
         The FDA may also require, or companies may conduct, additional clinical trials for the same indication after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 trials may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 trials can confirm or refute the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. 
         Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with current cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, manufacturers must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
         In relation to the clinical trial in the United Kingdom and in so far as trials will be conducted in other countries with a view to obtaining a marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency, there are equivalent cGMP requirements and European Union regulatory rules that are implemented nationally. However, enforcement of such rules is conducted by the regulatory authority in which the trial is carried out, which is the MHRA in the United Kingdom. 
   BLA submission, review by the FDA, and marketing approval 
         Assuming successful completion of the required clinical and preclinical testing, the results of product development, including chemistry, manufacture, and controls, non-clinical studies, and clinical 
 20

   trial results, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, are all submitted to the FDA, along with the proposed labeling, as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. These user fees must be paid at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances. One basis for a waiver of the application user fee is if the applicant employs fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, the applicant does not have an approved marketing application for a product that has been introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and the applicant, including its affiliates, is submitting its first marketing application. Product candidates that are designated as orphan products, which are further described below, are also not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication. 
         In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration, must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Also, under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, beginning in 2020, for applications for product candidates intended for the treatment of adult cancer which are directed at molecular targets that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of pediatric cancer, in place of the PREA investigations, sponsors must submit, with the application, reports from molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigations designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data, using appropriate formulations, to inform potential pediatric labeling. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Orphan products are also exempt from the PREA requirements. 
         The FDA also may require submission of a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must also be conducted at set intervals. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the risks. 
         Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review before it accepts the application for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. 
         Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set the review goal of completing its review of 90% of all applications within ten months from the 60-day filing date for its initial review of a BLA. This review goal is referred to as the PDUFA date. The PDUFA date is only a goal, thus, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The review process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the sponsor otherwise provides substantial additional information or clarification regarding the submission. 
         The FDA may also refer certain applications to an advisory committee. Before approving a biologic for which no active ingredient, including any ester or salt of active ingredients, has previously been approved by the FDA, the FDA must either refer that biologic to an external advisory committee 
 21

   or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why the FDA did not refer the product candidate to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, which review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
         The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and whether the manufacturing methods and controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity. Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontractors, are in compliance with current cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA the FDA will inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs. 
         After evaluating the BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval, and describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the BLA. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the BLA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either: resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has the goal of reviewing 90% of application resubmissions in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
         Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product's safety and efficacy after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may also not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing. 
         After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. The FDA may also withdraw the product approval if compliance with the pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards are not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling, or FDA notification may be required. 
         Broadly equivalent requirements and controls similarly apply to the submission of marketing authorization applications to the European Medicines Agency in the European Union and, post-approval, to the holding of such marketing authorizations. 
 22

          
  Biosimilars and exclusivity 
         The BPCIA creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires a high similarity to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical trial, absent a waiver by the FDA. There must be no difference between the reference product and a biosimilar in mechanism of action, conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biosimilar and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
         A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. However, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the twelve-year exclusivity period. The PHSA also includes provisions to protect reference products that have patent protection. The biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether there should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an action for declaratory judgment concerning the patent. 
         In the European Union there is a period of 10 years (or 11 years for significant new indications) of data exclusivity so that those seeking to market biosimilars cannot apply on an abridged basis for a marketing authorization for eight years from when the product was first marketed in the European Union and cannot place it on the market for 10 or 11 years from such first marketing. 
         If approved, biologics may also be eligible for periods of United States patent term restoration. If granted, patent term restoration extends the patent life of a single unexpired patent, that has not previously been extended, for a maximum of five years. The total patent life with the extension also cannot exceed fourteen years from the product's approval date. Subject to the prior limitations, the period of the extension is calculated by adding half of the time from the effective date of an IND to the initial submission of a marketing application, and all of the time between the submission of the marketing application and its approval. This period may also be reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence. 
         In the European Union, a supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, can similarly extend a patent term for a maximum of five years. A six-month additional extension, however, is available if the SPC relates to a medicinal product for which data has been submitted according to a Pediatric Investigation Plan. 
   Post-approval requirements 
         Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements related to manufacturing, recordkeeping, and reporting, including adverse experience reporting, deviation reporting, shortage reporting, and periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising, marketing, promotion, certain electronic records and signatures, and post-approval obligations imposed as a 
 23

   condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS, and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
         After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual program user fee requirements for approved products, excluding, under certain circumstances, orphan products. In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved therapeutics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, list their products, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with current cGMP and other requirements, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers. Manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with current cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
         Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from current cGMP and specifications and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain current cGMP compliance. 
         The FDA also strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity, and potency that are approved by the FDA. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for unapproved indications that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Biopharmaceutical companies, however, are required to promote their products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, but not limited to, criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts. 
         Moreover, the enacted Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, will be required to label products with a product identifier, and are required to keep certain records regarding the product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers is also required to be done electronically. Manufacturers must also verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufactures have product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Similar requirements additionally are and will be imposed through this legislation on other companies within the biopharmaceutical product supply chain, such as distributors and dispensers. 
 24

           Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports, including annual reports and deviation reports, are required following FDA approval of a BLA. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in significant regulatory actions. Such actions may include refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, provision of corrective information, imposition of post-market requirements including the need for additional testing, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, FDA debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government contracts, refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, and result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences. 
   Additional controls for biologics 
         To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states. 
         After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing the results of all of the manufacturer's tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. 
         In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 
   Fraud and abuse, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations 
         Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education, and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the CMS and the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including but not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations, which are described below, as well as state and federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
         The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which regulates, among other things, marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to 
 25

   induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order, or the referral to another for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, in whole or in part. The term "remuneration" has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between biopharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other, as well as free trial and starter prescriptions provided through pharmacies. There are certain statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of the facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The ACA modified the intent requirement under the Anti-Kickback Statute to a stricter standard, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA also provided that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is grounds for the government or a whistleblower to assert that a claim for payment of items or services resulting from such violation constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
         The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes "any request or demand" for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare provider or supplier numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a product's label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. In addition, private payers have been filing follow-on lawsuits alleging fraudulent misrepresentation, although establishing liability and damages in these cases is more difficult than under the civil False Claims Act. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. Civil False Claims Act actions may be brought by the government or may be brought by private individuals on behalf of the government, called "qui tam" actions. If the government decides to intervene in a qui tam action and prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in the proceeds from any fines or settlement funds. If the government declines to intervene, the individual may pursue the case alone. The civil False Claims Act provides for treble damages and a civil penalty for each false claim, such as an invoice or pharmacy claim for reimbursement, which can aggregate into millions of dollars. For these reasons, since 2004, civil False Claims Act lawsuits against biopharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements, as much as $3.0 billion, regarding certain sales practices and promoting off label uses. Civil False Claims Act liability may further be imposed for known Medicare or Medicaid overpayments, for example, overpayments caused by understated rebate amounts, that are not refunded within 60 days of discovering the overpayment, even if the overpayment was not caused by a false or fraudulent act. In addition, conviction or civil judgment for violating the civil False Claims Act may result in exclusion from federal health care programs, and 
 26

   suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts. 
         The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. 
         The civil monetary penalties statute is another potential statute under which biopharmaceutical companies may be subject to enforcement. Among other things, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes fines against any person who is determined to have knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
         Payment or reimbursement of prescription therapeutics by Medicaid or Medicare requires manufacturers to submit certified pricing information to CMS. The Medicaid Drug Rebate statute requires manufacturers to calculate and report price points, which are used to determine Medicaid rebate payments shared between the states and the federal government and Medicaid payment rates for certain therapeutics. For therapeutics paid under Medicare Part B, manufacturers must also calculate and report their Average Sales Price, which is used to determine the Medicare Part B payment rate. In addition, therapeutics covered by Medicaid are subject to an additional inflation penalty which can substantially increase rebate payments. For products approved under a BLA (including biosimilars), or an NDA, the VHCA requires manufacturers to calculate and report to the Veterans Administration, or VA, a different price called the Non-Federal Average Manufacturing Price, which is used to determine the maximum price that can be charged to certain federal agencies, referred to as the Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP. Like the Medicaid rebate amount, the FCP includes an inflation penalty. A Department of Defense regulation requires manufacturers to provide this discount on therapeutics dispensed by retail pharmacies when paid by the TRICARE Program. All of these price reporting requirements create risk of submitting false information to the government, and potential FCA liability. 
         The VHCA also requires manufacturers of covered therapeutics participating in the Medicaid program to enter into Federal Supply Schedule contracts with the VA through which their covered therapeutics must be sold to certain federal agencies at FCP. This necessitates compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations, including submission of commercial sales and pricing information, and subjects us to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions. In addition, the VHCA requires manufacturers participating in Medicaid to agree to provide different mandatory discounts to certain Public Health Service grantees and other safety net hospitals and clinics under the 340B program based on the manufacturer's reported Medicaid pricing information. The 340B program has its own regulatory authority to impose sanctions for non-compliance and adjudicate overcharge claims against manufacturers by the purchasing entities. 
         The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, in connection with the delivery or payment for health care benefits, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. Additionally, the ACA amended the intent requirement of certain of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or 
 27

   entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation. 
         The ACA further created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered therapeutics, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. 
         Further, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its respective implementing regulations imposes certain requirements on covered entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of certain individually identifiable health information known as protected health information. Among other things, HITECH, through its implementing regulations, makes HIPAA's security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as a person or organization, other than a member of a covered entity's workforce, that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits protected health information on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. HITECH also strengthened the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates, and individuals, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, other federal and state laws may govern the privacy and security of health and other information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not be preempted by HIPPA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
         Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers' use of prescriber-identifiable data. Certain states also require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments or the provision of other items of value that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; impose restrictions on marketing practices; or require manufacturers to track and report information related to payments, gifts, and other items of value to physicians and other healthcare providers. Recently, states have enacted or are considering legislation intended to make drug prices more transparent and deter significant price increases. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. 
         If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject penalties or other enforcement actions, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
         To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. In the European Union, the data privacy laws are generally perceived to be stricter than those which apply in the United States and include specific requirements for the transfer of personal data outside the European Union 
 28

   to the United States to ensure that European Union standards of data privacy will be applied to such data. 
   Coverage and reimbursement generally 
         The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, and other third-party payors, provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. Government authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations generally decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by CMS through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program, including supplemental rebate programs that restrict coverage to therapeutics on the state Preferred Drug List. Similarly, government laws and regulations establish the parameters for coverage of prescription therapeutics by health plans participating in state exchanges and Tricare, the health care program for military personnel, retirees, and related beneficiaries. Some states have also created pharmacy assistance programs for individuals who do not qualify for federal programs. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services. 
         In the United States, the European Union, and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be and sometimes at or below the provider's acquisition cost. In the United States, it is also common for government and private health plans to use coverage determinations to leverage rebates from manufacturers in order to reduce the plans' net costs. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and lower the realization on manufacturers' sales of prescription therapeutics. Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific therapeutic products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication or might impose high copayment amounts to influence patient choice. Third-party payors also control costs by requiring prior authorization or imposing other dispensing restrictions before covering certain products and by broadening therapeutic classes to increase competition. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Absent clinical differentiators, third-party payors may treat products as therapeutically equivalent and base formulary decisions on net cost. To lower the prescription cost, manufacturers frequently rebate a portion of the prescription price to the third-party payors. Recently, purchasers and third-party payors have begun to focus on value of new therapeutics and sought agreements in which price is based on achievement of performance metrics. 
         Federal programs also impose price controls through mandatory ceiling prices on purchases by federal agencies and federally funded hospitals and clinics and mandatory rebates on retail pharmacy prescriptions paid by Medicaid and Tricare. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under 
 29

   government programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. In addition, government programs like Medicaid include substantial penalties for increasing commercial prices over the rate of inflation which can affect realization and return on investment. 
         Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. In addition, many government programs as a condition of participation mandate fixed discounts or rebates from manufacturers regardless of formulary position or utilization, and then rely on competition in the market to attain further price reductions, which can greatly reduce realization on the sale. 
         Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement, and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, competition within therapeutic classes, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid, and healthcare reform, biopharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies, and pricing in general. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, and other third-party payors. 
         As a result of the above, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective, or the rebate percentages required to secure coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost. 
         Moreover, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in therapeutic development. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. 
         The absence in Europe of any substantive harmonization of pricing and reimbursement regimes, including health technology assessment, means that separate negotiations will need to take place with the relevant authorities in each member state. 
   Healthcare reform measures 
         The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, and expanding access. In the United States, the 
 30

   biopharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
         For example, Medicare Part B, which covers products administered by physicians in an outpatient setting, may be undergoing a significant change in payment rates. CMS has proposed a rule that would compensate physicians for therapeutics they administer based on a smaller mark-up over the manufacturer's Average Sales Price and a fixed fee, which is intended to incentivize physicians to purchase and bill Medicare for lower priced products. The proposed rule would also authorize CMS to establish methods for determining comparative cost effectiveness and seek value-based discounts 
         Similarly, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 established funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducts patient-centered outcome research, develops evidence-based tools and resources on medication therapies, maintains databases of health care related data and standards, and issues periodic reports on specific studies. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the organization's research has had or will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor's product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
         Moreover, the ACA broadened access to health insurance, attempts to reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhanced remedies against fraud and abuse, added new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, imposed new taxes and fees on the health care industry, and imposed additional health policy reforms. The law expanded the eligibility criteria and mandatory eligibility categories for Medicaid programs, thereby potentially increasing both the volume of sales and manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability. The law also expanded the 340B discount program that mandates discounts to certain hospitals, community centers, and other qualifying providers, by expanding the categories of entities eligible to purchase under the program, although, with the exception of children's hospitals, these newly eligible entities are ineligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan therapeutics used to treat an orphan disease or condition. The ACA revised the definition of "average manufacturer price", or AMP, for reporting purposes, which generally increased the amount of Medicaid rebates to states and created a separate AMP for certain categories of therapeutics provided in non-retail outpatient settings. The law additionally extended manufacturer's Medicaid rebate liability to covered therapeutics dispensed to patients enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations and increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. The revisions to the AMP definition and Medicaid rebate formula can have the further effect of increasing the required 340B discounts. Further, the ACA requires manufacturers of therapeutics to pay 50% of the pharmacy charge to Medicare Part D patients while they are in the coverage gap, and this percentage was increased to 70% by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Finally, the ACA imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription therapeutic products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted through the ACA and otherwise, including the reporting of therapeutic sample distribution, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. Although the ACA was recently amended to repeal the individual insurance mandate, and efforts to repeal and replace portions of the law may continue, it is likely that pressure on biopharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, will continue, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our product 
 31

   candidates. Recently, CMS issued regulations reducing Medicare Part B payments to certain hospitals for outpatient therapeutics purchased under the 340B program. 
         The cost of biopharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the biopharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms. 
         Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates. 
         In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 retained the federal budget "sequestration" Medicare payment reductions of 2%, and extended it through 2027. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could further limit the prices we are able to charge, or the amounts of reimbursement available, for our product candidates once they are approved. The Bipartisan Budget Act also extended Manufacturer responsibility for prescription costs in the Medicare Part D coverage gap to biosimilars, which had previously been exempt. 
   The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
         The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts. 
         Other foreign anti-corruption regimes are arguably of wider application. For instance, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 applies to dealings with any decision maker whether in the private or public sector in a position of trust.
