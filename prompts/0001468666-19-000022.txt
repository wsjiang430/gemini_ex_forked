Industry Background
Increasing cybersecurity challenges have created a large and fragmented market for IT security products and services.
We believe that many organizations that use the information technology, or IT, security products and services available in the market remain vulnerable to cyber attacks because they rely on a collection of uncoordinated “point” products that address specific security issues but fall short in identifying and defending against next-generation cyber threats. 
Organizations of all sizes are using new information technologies to make their businesses more productive and effective.
Modern IT infrastructures are growing in complexity and often include a combination of on-premises, cloud and hybrid environments. In addition, the adoption of mobile computing allows access to critical business information from various devices and locations. The widespread adoption of these advanced IT architectures, along with the rapid growth of connected devices and new ways of delivering IT services, enables organizations to benefit from business applications that are more powerful and easier to deploy, use and maintain.
This rapidly evolving IT environment is increasingly vulnerable to frequent and sophisticated cyber attacks.
The evolving landscape of applications, modes of communication and IT architectures makes it increasingly challenging for businesses to protect their critical business assets from cyber threats. New technologies heighten security risks by increasing the number of ways a threat actor can attack a target by giving users greater access to important business networks and information and by facilitating the transfer of control of underlying applications and infrastructure to third-party vendors. 
Cyber attacks have evolved from computer viruses written by amateur hackers into highly complex and targeted attacks led by highly skilled adversaries intent on stealing information or causing financial and reputational damage.
The economic and reputational impact of attacks, coupled with growing regulatory requirements, makes cybersecurity defense increasingly a priority for senior management and boards of directors.
In the wake of numerous high-profile data breaches, organizations are increasingly aware of the financial and reputational risks associated with IT security vulnerabilities. We believe that the cybersecurity programs of most organizations do not rival the persistence, tactical skill and technological prowess of today’s cyber adversaries. As a result, cyber attacks are successfully breaching organizations’ networks. Security breaches can be highly public and result in reputational damage and legal liability as well as large losses in productivity and revenue. Many organizations are particularly concerned about attacks that attempt to misappropriate sensitive and valuable business information. Adding to the urgency of the IT security challenge, new regulations and industry-specific compliance requirements direct organizations to design, implement, document and demonstrate controls and processes to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of information received and stored on their systems. 
The traditional cybersecurity approach of using numerous point products often fails to detect threats and block attacks.
Information systems at many organizations are vulnerable to breach because they rely on a collection of uncoordinated point security products that address security risks in a piecemeal fashion rather than in a proactive and coordinated manner. An effective cyber defense strategy requires the coordinated deployment of multiple products and services tailored to an organization’s specific security needs. Point products, however, primarily address security issues in a reactive manner by employing passive auditing or basic blocking techniques, and often lack the integration and intelligent monitoring capabilities and management within a common framework necessary to provide effective information security throughout an organization. 
Identifying and hiring qualified security professionals are significant challenges for many organizations.
The difficulty in providing effective information security is exacerbated by the highly competitive environment for identifying, hiring and retaining qualified information security professionals. 
As a result, organizations engage information security services vendors to integrate, monitor and manage their point products to enhance their defenses against cyber threats.
Because many organizations cannot adequately protect their networks from cyber threats, they are augmenting their IT security strategies to include information security services. By using these services, organizations seek to decrease their vulnerability to security breaches, increase the effectiveness of their existing investments in security products and free their own IT staff to focus on other responsibilities.
Traditional information security services vendors, however, often fail to satisfy the IT security needs of organizations, causing many of them to seek the advantages of our solutions.
Many organizations lack sufficient internal cybersecurity expertise to keep pace with the rapidly evolving threat landscape. As a result, these organizations engage the support of information security services providers as part of their IT security strategy. However, traditional information security services offered by telecommunications providers, security product vendors, large IT outsourcing firms and small regional providers often lack a broad perspective on the threat landscape, are unable to scale their services to match organizations’ data processing requirements, fail to provide actionable security information, focus only on a subset of organizations’ security needs or have limited deployment options.
Our intelligence-driven information security solutions, as described below, offer an innovative approach to prevent, detect, respond to and predict cybersecurity breaches. We believe that our singular focus on providing a comprehensive portfolio of information security solutions makes us a trusted advisor and an attractive partner for our customers. This focus enables us to pursue a go-to-market strategy that addresses the diverse needs of our customers around the world. Our vendor-neutral approach enables our customers to enhance their evolving IT security infrastructure, appliances and best of breed technologies with our solutions and capabilities, which together provide our customers with both a comprehensive and highly-effective security defense posture.

Our Technology Platform
We utilize the key components of our infrastructure described below to deliver our intelligence-driven information solutions to our customers.
Counter Threat Platform
Our proprietary Counter Threat Platform was purpose-built to be the foundation of our information security solutions. It has a multi-tenant, distributed architecture that enables our software to run on a single platform while providing simultaneous access to multiple users. The platform collects, aggregates, correlates and analyzes billions of daily events (currently as many as 310 billion per day) from our extensive customer base, and uses sophisticated algorithms to detect malicious activity and deliver security countermeasures, dynamic intelligence and valuable context regarding the intentions and actions of cyber adversaries. The timely analysis and routing of this security information enables our solutions to assess risk in near real time and allows us to report rapidly to our customers worldwide. The platform is highly flexible, permitting us to tailor our solutions to a customer’s unique environment, and can be configured to identify specific security events of interest to a particular customer. Our platform was designed to be vendor-neutral. As a result, it can aggregate events from a wide range of security and network devices, applications and endpoints.
The platform leverages our intelligence, gained over 19 years of processing and handling events, to provide insight into how attacks are initiated and spread across our customers’ networks. The platform also applies security intelligence based on threat indicators continuously gathered by our Counter Threat Unit research team through in-depth analysis of the cyber threat environment. This team conducts research into emerging threat actors and new attack tactics, and develops countermeasures that we apply to the platform to enable our customers proactively to prevent and detect compromises of their security. Our ability to see more security incidents along with the applied intelligence acts as an early warning system that enables our security analysts proactively to alert customers, apply protections and respond quickly with appropriate context. The more security events we see, the more accurate our protections are and the more accurately we can respond.
The Counter Threat Platform is supported by the following proprietary technologies: 

• | Counter Threat Appliance. Our Counter Threat Appliance performs several of the important functions of the Counter Threat Platform. The Counter Threat Appliance is a physical or virtual appliance deployed in a customer’s data center, branch office or cloud environment, or our own data center. This technology supports a wide range of security and network devices, applications and endpoints to collect information on the customer environment, perform analytics and report to our counter threat operations centers. The Counter Threat Appliance establishes secure non-intrusive communications to transmit data back to our data centers, where the Counter Threat Platform enriches data with our intelligence based on our intimate knowledge of threats and customer specific intelligence to detect security incidents.


• | Foresee. Foresee, our behavioral and self-learning technology, identifies malicious events through the use of machine learning algorithms to determine the probability and confidence that a particular event or a collection of events is malicious. Foresee learns which events are malicious or non-malicious based on ongoing feedback from our certified security analysts and applies machine-learning analysis techniques for the discovery of previously unknown threats.


• | Multi-Purpose Logic Engine. Our Multi-Purpose Logic Engine is an analytics engine that leverages our broad visibility into the global threat environment and applied intelligence from the Counter Threat Unit to identify security incidents of interest. The engine intelligently analyzes billions of events into actionable information, providing valuable context to our security analysts to help inform their analysis of the security incidents and shorten the customer’s response time.


• | Very Large Database. Our Very Large Database efficiently and cost-effectively collects, correlates, analyzes and stores billions of structured and unstructured data elements, which help us to identify new security threats, provide valuable context to our security analysts and customers and enable Counter Threat Unit researchers to perform historical threat analysis.


• | Threat Intelligence Management System, or TIMS. We manage structured and unstructured data in TIMS. TIMS collects, correlates and analyzes billions of data points to catalogue threat actors and generate threat indicators applied to the Counter Threat Platform and across our solutions. The data points are sourced from our managed security solutions, malware, social media, honeypots (or traps set to detect or counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems), open source intelligence, hunting and incident response engagements, strategic relationships and priority research.


• | Catalog for Artifact and Signal Extraction, or CASE. CASE is a repository and a set of tools for the dynamic analysis of malware to catalogue its behaviors and generate threat indicators. CASE feeds into TIMS threat indicators identified from the analysis of malware.


• | Attacker Database. Our Counter Threat Unit research team maintains a patented process for generating a proprietary Attacker Database that contains machine readable threat intelligence we apply to the Counter Threat Platform, iSensorTM, Red CloakTM and third-party security controls.


• | Portal. Powered by integrated intelligence and analytics tools, the portal delivers near real time information to customer executives, managers and security professionals and provides insights that help customers make better security decisions. It also facilitates near real time communication between customers and our security analysts, measures the effectiveness of a customer’s security profile using asset-based and risk-weighted analyses, supports regulatory compliance requirements, links threat intelligence from our Counter Threat Unit and enables a visualization of point-in-time, comparative and historical security trends across multiple security metrics. Our portal is accessible via web and mobile applications as well as via customer applications that leverage our application programming interfaces.

Security Operations Center Automation
We have developed several technologies integrated into the Counter Threat Platform to automate operations within our counter threat operations centers, where our security professionals identify, diagnose and respond to security information.

• | Threat Analysis Platform. We present threat information to our certified security analysts in a graphical user interface. This interface supports the delivery of high-quality security analysis of threats targeting or occurring within a customer’s environment. Visualization enables our security analysts to detect patterns and to determine in near real time relationships of security incidents within a customer environment and across our entire customer base. Our security analysts have access to all data collected from customer environments and human readable threat intelligence from our Counter Threat Unit to provide them with the context necessary to inform their analysis and to help them determine whether they should communicate information about a security incident to a customer.


• | Ticket Management. Our ticket management system is based on Information Technology Infrastructure Library principles and delivers security monitoring and device management solutions to customers. A sophisticated and configurable workflow provides incident, change and problem management in a leveraged-service delivery model to enable our counter threat operations centers to handle a higher volume of work with consistent quality.


• | Management and Monitoring Tools. To effectively manage and monitor our infrastructure at customer sites and our data centers, we rely on a suite of purpose-built software applications to facilitate the full lifecycle management of all software and configuration deployments and updates, efficient management and troubleshooting, and monitoring of the health and availability of devices.

Other Enabling Technologies

• | iSensor. Many of our customers use our proprietary network intrusion detection and prevention appliance, the iSensor. The iSensor eliminates malicious inbound and outbound traffic in near real time by performing in-line deep packet inspection (which is an examination of packet data as the data pass through the device for signs of malware, intrusions or other threats) and by applying countermeasures from the Counter Threat Unit.


• | Red Cloak. Red Cloak, our endpoint threat detection software, allows us to apply our threat intelligence and advanced analytics to the endpoint to reduce the amount of time required to detect a compromise of security and reduce the effort required to respond. Red Cloak also allows us to develop strategic countermeasures that interdict tactics used by threat actors.


• | Third-Party Technologies. Our intelligence-driven information security solutions are designed to monitor alerts, logs and other messages across multiple stages of the threat lifecycle. In addition to security monitoring, we offer device management for many leading security platforms. In deploying these solutions, we integrate a wide array of proprietary and third-party security products. Our technology supports firewalls from market-leading vendors, including, but not limited to, Cisco Systems, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., Juniper Networks, Inc., Fortinet, Inc. and SonicWall. In addition, we also support intrusion prevention systems from vendors such as Intel Corp. (McAfee), and web application firewalls from vendors such as Imperva, Inc., F5 Networks, Inc. and Citrix Systems, Inc.

Further, we maintain alliance partnerships with key technology providers who deliver capabilities we see as valuable in keeping our customers secure. These partnerships involve technology licensing, joint technology development, integration, research cooperation, co-marketing and sell-through arrangements. The principal technologies we license or resell from some of these key technology partners provide our customers with the following capabilities that in many instances we integrate into our solutions:

• | Carbon Black – endpoint security

This option is particularly suitable for organizations that already possess in-house security expertise, but that seek to remove the burden of managing devices from their staff so they can focus on more strategic security initiatives.
Monitored. Customers selecting our monitored solutions obtain access to our on-demand Counter Threat Platform through our web-based portal, plus near real time monitoring and analysis by our security analysts of events collected from security and network devices and applications. Our monitored solutions enhance our customers’ security position by providing them with valuable context from our team of security analysts and comprehensive reporting to demonstrate regulatory compliance. Our ability to see more security incidents across our entire customer base along with our threat intelligence acts as an early warning system, which benefits customers by proactively alerting them to potential threats, applying protections and helping them respond quickly. We believe that the more we see, the more accurate our protections are, and the more accurately we can respond. Through our monitored solutions, we leverage our on-demand Counter Threat Platform to correlate information from many devices and applications, providing security analysts with the context they need to significantly reduce falsely-positive results and alert customers to actual threats against their organizations.
In general, our managed delivery options require our security professionals to be directly involved with our customer’s security technology, and as a result, the cost to service these delivery options is generally higher than the cost to service monitored delivery options. Over the last three fiscal years, we have generated the majority of our managed security solutions revenue from either fully managed or co-managed delivery options. Our future success depends on our ability to manage efficiently the costs of our security offerings and to price our security solutions in an effective manner.
Threat Intelligence
Powered by our Counter Threat Unit research team, threat intelligence provides early warnings and actionable intelligence that enables rapid protection against threats and vulnerabilities before they affect an organization. Threat intelligence is applied as part of our managed security offerings, but also may be offered separately.
Global Threat Intelligence. Our global threat intelligence solutions provide proactive, actionable intelligence tailored to an organization’s environment. This intelligence includes clear, concise threat and vulnerability analysis, detailed remediation information and recommendations, consultation with our threat experts, on-demand access to extensive threat and vulnerability databases, malware analysis upon request, intelligence feeds and integration with our other solutions for correlation and unified reporting.
Borderless Threat Monitoring. Our borderless threat monitoring solution delivers organizations with timely and actionable security intelligence that provides them with insight into threat activities that may exist beyond the edge of their network. This solution proactively informs organizations of network threat indicators that apply to their particular network environment and allows them to manage the threat in accordance with their escalation policies.
Malware Code Analysis. Our malware code analysis solution focuses on reverse engineering malicious or unknown code identified in security events in order to provide an organization with a better understanding of the code’s behavior and its impact on the organization’s systems and information. Using advanced computer forensic tools and techniques, our security experts dissect the code to determine its functionality, purpose, composition and source.
Enterprise Brand Surveillance. Our enterprise brand surveillance solution offers near real time monitoring of a range of intelligence outlets to identify developing threats from exposure of sensitive data, targeting by threat actors and risks to perception of the customer’s brand. This solution provides our customers with live notifications delivered upon discovery of actionable intelligence. It also provides customers with context regarding potential threats and helps them to develop informed risk mitigation strategies.
Security and Risk Consulting
Our consulting organization provides expertise and analysis to help customers improve their security posture by comprehensively assessing security capabilities, designing and building robust security programs, preparing employees against cyber attacks, facilitating regulatory compliance and helping customers identify, prioritize and resolve the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest threat. We offer both project-based and long-term contracts, including retainer contracts sold together with our managed security solutions. For example, we may enter into a managed security contract bundled together with an incident response retainer.
Our team has extensive experience conducting security, compliance and risk engagements across many industries and geographic areas, and under recent regulations and industry standards that impose security mandates. Professional services offered by the team include the following:
Technical Testing and Assessments. Our testing and assessment solutions provide customers with the knowledge, expertise and efficiency needed to conduct thorough security and risk evaluations of their environments. We offer testing and assessments that address logical, physical, technical and non-technical threats in order to identify gaps that create risk, construct a stronger security posture and meet compliance mandates. Our testing and assessments solutions include application security, network security and Red Team testing, which simulates cyber attacks using real-world tactics, techniques and procedures.

Security and Governance Program Development. Our security and governance program development solutions provide our customers with security, risk and compliance expertise to help them develop strategic security and governance programs based on industry and observed best practices. These solutions include internal audit support and the development of corporate information security and computer security incident response security awareness programs.
Targeted Threat Hunting. The Targeted Threat Hunting solution uses proprietary technology to search customer networks to identify the presence of security compromises and entrenched threat actors operating in a customer’s environment. The solution draws on our threat intelligence and extensive experience countering cyber adversaries.
Cloud Security. We help customers to deliver cloud-based services securely and to satisfy their compliance requirements. Our cloud security solutions include cloud security strategic consulting, cloud risk assessment, assurance testing of cloud deployments, incident response in cloud environments and cloud security architecture and design.
Security Design and Architecture Solutions. Our security design and architecture solutions help customers to clarify their information security priorities and identify their most vulnerable assets that require security monitoring, as well as to obtain a prioritized roadmap of upgrades to help with budgeting and determining resource requirements. Our solutions include security health check solutions, security architecture assessment solutions and security architecture and design consulting.
Security Residency Solutions. Our security residency solutions provide customers with security consultants who serve as extended members of their staff either on-site or remotely to extend and heighten an organization’s security expertise and capabilities. We offer several levels of resident security consultants, including executive, expert and technical consultants tailored to the security expertise and leadership our customers need. Residency solutions often are combined with managed security solutions in complex enterprise environments to enhance the value customers obtain from our solutions. Consulting residents align our solutions with the customers’ internal processes, integrate our data feeds into customer applications and 
dashboards, and produce customized analytics and reporting. In addition, residents can assist customers with handling the security events identified by our managed security solutions.
Incident Response
Incident response typically is deployed along with security and risk consulting. The professionals who deliver incident response engagements help customers rapidly analyze, contain and remediate security breaches to minimize their duration and impact.
Incident Management Proactive Solutions. Through our incident management proactive solutions, our security consultants work with customers to prepare them to respond quickly and effectively to a security incident. In providing these solutions, we feature both incident management risk assessment and response plan review and development solutions. Our incident management risk assessment solution evaluates a customer’s ability to detect, resist and respond to a targeted or advanced threat and is designed to help our customers understand their exposure to these threats, including advanced persistent threats, or APTs, in order to reduce their risk of compromise. Our response plan review and development solution supports our customers in developing an effective computer security incident response plan, or CSIRP, based on IT security best practices, incorporating the latest threat intelligence tailored to the customer’s specific needs.

Incident Response Testing and Capability Analysis. Through real-world simulations, incident response testing and capability analysis tests and evaluates the effectiveness of an organization’s CSIRP and attack response procedures. We employ tabletop exercises to subject IT teams to simulated threats, such as cyber-crime and APTs. The exercises demonstrate the ways a customer’s systems and network can be breached and the critical actions required during a breach to contain a threat.
Emergency Incident Response Solutions. Through our comprehensive range of incident response and management solutions, we seek to ensure that organizations experience minimal economic loss and operational disruption when a security incident occurs. We offer an incident response retainer, through which our security experts can provide emergency incident response solutions within minutes of a reported breach. Our security consultants work to minimize the duration and impact of any breach through incident management, surveillance, digital forensic analysis, malware analysis and reverse engineering.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to drive revenue growth by enhancing market awareness of our solutions, building a strong sales pipeline and cultivating customer relationships. We offer managed security and threat intelligence on a subscription basis. We sell these solutions under contracts with initial terms that typically range from one to three years and, as of February 1, 2019, averaged two years in duration. We provide security and risk consulting primarily under fixed-price contracts, although we perform some engagements under variable-priced contracts on a time-and-materials basis.
Sales
We sell primarily through our direct sales organization, supplemented by sales through our channel partners, including referral agents, regional value-added resellers and trade associations. Approximately 92% of our revenue in fiscal 2019 was generated through our direct sales force, in some cases in collaboration with members of Dell’s sales force, with the remaining portion generated through our channel partners. 

Our direct sales organization consists of insides sales and field sales personnel and solutions architects organized by core customer segments and geography. Our sales strategy varies based on the size of the company and the target point-of-entry into an organization, which is primarily through chief information security officers or other IT leaders, including security executives, security specialists, compliance officers and IT generalists. Within North America, our direct sales organization has separate teams focused on the large enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses, and U.S. state and local government agencies. We believe that continued additional investment in our sales staff will contribute to our long-term growth.
We believe that our sales process differentiates us in the marketplace for information security solutions. The process typically begins by emphasizing the importance of educating key IT decision makers within a customer organization with respect to the organization’s information security needs. We deliver a technical evaluation performed by a team that includes both highly trained sales personnel and security experts. This allows us to tailor the solution design, including the level of service and deployment options, to the organization’s specific security needs and to become its long-term advisor and partner. A typical large enterprise sales team includes an inside sales team that is responsible for developing sales leads, a direct sales team that is responsible for obtaining new customers and some cross-sales, an enterprise account management team that is responsible for renewals and some cross-sales, and security engineers who provide technical support to our sales personnel.
Since our acquisition by Dell in February 2011, we have marketed our solutions through Dell’s channel partners as well as through our own and have entered into agreements with Dell to preserve, and potentially expand, our existing commercial arrangements with Dell.
Marketing
Our marketing efforts seek to enhance our brand, expand our market awareness, bring our solutions to market and build a strong sales pipeline. Our marketing team consists primarily of solutions marketing, field marketing, demand generation and public and industry analyst relations functions. We actively manage our public relations efforts and communicate directly with IT professionals and the media in an effort to promote our information security solutions and contribute to the business community’s ongoing examination and understanding of information security. We participate in industry trade shows and conferences, drive thought leadership in our industry, host webcasts, conduct online marketing activities and use various other marketing strategies to create awareness of our brand and offerings.
Customer Service, Training and Support
Customer service, training and support are key elements of our commitment to provide superior customer service. We have a comprehensive customer service training and support program to communicate our commitment to customer service and to enhance the value that our customers derive from our solutions. We provide extensive education, training and support on the functionality of our solutions, so that our customers are able to fully utilize their benefits. Our customer service training and support team provides dependable and timely resolution of customer security concerns and technical inquiries, and our certified security analysts are continuously available to customers for consultation by telephone or e-mail and over the Internet through our portal. We regularly conduct customer surveys to help us evaluate and develop our existing solutions and other solutions that we believe could enhance our customer relationships.
Competition
The market for information security services is very competitive, and we expect competition to continue to increase in the future. Changes in the threat landscape and the broader IT infrastructure have led to quickly evolving customer requirements for protection from security threats and adversaries.
We compete primarily against the following four types of security services and product providers, some of which operate principally in the large enterprise market and others in the market for small and medium-sized businesses:

▪ | global telecommunications and network services providers such as AT&T Inc., BT Group PLC, Verizon Communications Inc. and NTT Communications Corp.;


▪ | providers of specialized or niche IT security products and services such as FireEye, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and Symantec Corporation;


▪ | diversified technology companies such as Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Intel Corporation; and


▪ | regional information security services providers that compete in the small and medium-sized businesses market with some of the features present in our information security solutions.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:


▪ | global visibility into the threat landscape;


▪ | ability to generate actionable intelligence based on historical data and emerging threats;


▪ | scalability and overall performance of platform technologies;


▪ | ability to integrate with, monitor and manage a variety of third-party products;


▪ | ability to provide a flexible deployment option to cater to specific customer needs;


▪ | ability to attract and retain high-quality professional staff with information security expertise;


▪ | brand awareness and reputation;


▪ | strength of sales and marketing efforts;


▪ | cost effectiveness;


▪ | customer service and support; and


▪ | breadth and richness of threat intelligence, including history of data collection and diversity and geographic scope of customers.


We believe that we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of the architecture, features and performance of our Counter Threat Platform, the quality of our threat intelligence, the security expertise within our organization, and the ease of integration of our solutions and platform with other technology infrastructures. However, many of our existing and potential competitors, particularly in the large enterprise market, have advantages over us because of their longer operating histories, greater brand name recognition, larger customer bases, more extensive relationships within large commercial enterprises, more mature intellectual property portfolios and greater financial and technical resources.
Research and Development
We invest significant time and resources to maintain, enhance and add new functionality to our Counter Threat Platform and purpose-built technologies that are critical enablers of our solutions. Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development and testing of all aspects of our suite of information security solutions. The members of the organization have deep security and software expertise and work closely with our product management and customer service training and support teams to gain insights into customers’ environments for use in threat research, product development and innovations. The organization focuses its research on identifying next-generation threats and adversaries and developing countermeasures, which are continuously applied to our platform and used to respond to the rapidly evolving security threat landscape. The majority of our research and development team is based in our offices in Atlanta, Georgia, Providence, Rhode Island, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Edinburgh, Scotland, and Hyderabad, India. 
We believe that innovation and the timely development of new solutions are essential to meeting the needs of our customers and improving our competitive position. Several of the solutions we have released in the past year are the result of our internal processes within our company to identify and solve difficult security issues and use the best ideas to develop new solutions. As our customers move their applications and data into third-party cloud environments, we will extend and integrate our solutions into these environments globally. In addition, point solutions we develop for customers during security and risk consulting engagements often are integrated into our portfolio of solutions and made available to our broader customer base.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an essential element of our business. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as confidentiality, employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements.
Our employees and contractors involved in technology development are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, processes and other intellectual property rights conceived or reduced to practice by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those intellectual property rights. We maintain internal policies regarding confidentiality and disclosure. Our customer and resale contracts prohibit reverse engineering, decompiling and other similar uses of our technologies and require that our technologies be returned to us upon termination of the contract. We also require our vendors and other third parties who have access to our confidential information or proprietary technology to enter into confidentiality agreements with us.
Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without our consent intellectual property that we own or otherwise have the right to use. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses we incur in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, which leads to frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, large and established companies in the IT security industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. From time to time, third parties, including some of these large companies as well as non-practicing entities, may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our end-customers, which we are obligated to indemnify against such claims under our standard license and other agreements. Successful claims of infringement by a third party, if any, could prevent us from performing certain solutions, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages (including, in the United States, treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents), royalties or other fees.
Patents and Patent Applications
As of February 1, 2019, we owned 28 issued patents and 23 pending patent applications in the United States and four issued patents and two pending patent applications outside the United States. The issued patents are currently expected to expire between 2019 and 2037. Although we believe that our patents as a whole are important to our business, we are not substantially dependent on any single patent.
We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to modify or narrow our claims, as has happened in the past with respect to certain claims. Any patents that may be issued to us may not provide us with any meaningful protection or competitive advantages, or may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. 
Trademarks and Copyrights
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted us federal registrations for some of our trademarks. Federal registration of trademarks is effective for as long as we continue to use the trademarks and renew our registrations. We also have obtained protection for some of our trademarks, and have pending applications for trademark protection, in the European Community and various countries. We may, however, be unable to obtain trademark protection for our technologies and brands, and any trademarks that may be issued in the future may not distinguish our solutions from those of our competitors.
We do not generally register any of our works of authorship, including software and source code, with the U.S. Copyright Office, but instead rely on the protection afforded to such works by U.S. copyright laws, which provide protection to authors of original works whether published or unpublished and whether registered or unregistered.
We have entered into a trademark license agreement with Dell Inc. under which Dell Inc. has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to use the trademark “DELL,” solely in the form of “SECUREWORKS-A DELL COMPANY,” in connection with our business and products, services and advertising and marketing materials related to our business.

Employees
As of February 1, 2019, we employed 2,663 full-time employees in the United States and 21 other countries. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or the subject of a collective-bargaining agreement. Employees of some of our foreign subsidiaries are represented on workers’ councils.
