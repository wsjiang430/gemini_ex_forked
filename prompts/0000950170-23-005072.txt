 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: SSNC) is the world’s largest hedge fund and private equity administrator, as well as the largest mutual fund transfer agent. SS&C’s unique business model combines end-to-end expertise across financial services operations with software and solutions to service even the most demanding customers in the financial services and healthcare industries. SS&C owns and operates the full technology stack across securities accounting, front-to-back-office operations, performance and risk analytics, regulatory reporting and healthcare information processes.
SS&C’s trusted and proven technology delivers an unparalleled level of scalable capabilities for the most complex portfolios, the most sophisticated strategies, and the highest volumes of transactions. Through a series of carefully selected acquisitions and organic growth, the breadth and depth of SS&C’s expertise in financial services and healthcare technology are unmatched.
 Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Windsor, Connecticut, the Company is home to over 27,000 employees and has 121 offices in 90 cities globally. With over 20,000 clients spanning the health and financial services industries, our customers’ needs and requirements are always at the forefront of our strategy. We provide the global financial services industry with a broad range of software-enabled services, which consist of software-enabled outsourcing services and subscription-based on-demand cloud solutions that are managed and hosted at our facilities, and specialized software products, which are deployed at our clients’ facilities. Our software-enabled services, which combine the strengths of our proprietary software with our domain expertise, enable our clients to contract with us to provide many of their mission-critical and complex business processes. For example, we utilize our software to deliver comprehensive fund administration services to alternative and traditional asset managers, including fund manager services, transfer agency services, funds-of-funds services, tax processing and accounting. We offer clients the flexibility to choose from multiple software delivery options, including on premise applications and hosted, multi-tenant or dedicated applications. Additionally, we provide clients with targeted, blended solutions based on a combination of software and software-enabled services. We believe that our software-enabled services provide superior client support and an attractive alternative to clients that do not wish to install, manage and maintain complicated financial software.
 We also serve the healthcare industry through our SS&C Health services and technology-enabled business. The core purpose of our health business is to enable our clients to provide better healthcare by efficiently operationalizing and effectively scaling their care strategies through improved quality, cost, experience and outcomes to their members. We do this by applying modern technology to medical and pharmacy claims processing, data and analytics and simplifying and improving the experience for our client users and their members. SS&C Health’s market segments are health plans and pharmacy benefit managers, specifically, those who serve government-funded member segments and those who are seeking a flexible and scalable alternatives to larger integrated vendors. As a total health partner, our suite of solutions spans across health plan operations. These options include core claims processing, operational software and high value applications for risk adjustment and quality management. These solutions enable us to serve a large population of payer clients across the market segments.
 Our business model is characterized by high revenue retention rates and significant cash flow. We generate revenues primarily through our high-value software-enabled services. Our software-enabled services are generally provided under contracts with initial terms of one to five years that require monthly or quarterly payments and are subject to automatic annual renewal at the end of the initial term unless terminated by either party. We also generate revenues by licensing our software to clients through either perpetual or term licenses and by selling maintenance services. Maintenance services are generally provided under annually renewable contracts. Pricing in our software-enabled services businesses scales based on several factors which can include our clients’ assets under management, the complexity of asset classes managed, the number of accounts serviced, the volume of transactions, trading volume, medical claims and pharmacy claims volume and the level of service the client requires. We have experienced average revenue retention rates in each of the last five years of greater than 95% on our software-enabled services and maintenance and term licenses contracts for our core enterprise products. We believe that the high value-added nature of our products and services has enabled us to maintain our high revenue retention rates.
 We generated revenues of $5,283.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to revenues of $5,051.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. In 2022, we generated 75% of our revenues from clients in North America and 25% from clients outside North America. Our revenues are highly diversified, with our largest client in 2022 accounting for less than 5% of our revenues. Additional financial information, including geographic information, is available in our Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.



Our Industry
 We serve a number of vertical markets within the financial services and healthcare industries. Our financial services clients include alternative investment funds, investment management firms, institutional and retail asset managers, insurance companies, registered investment advisors (“RIAs”), wealth managers, banks and brokerage firms. Our healthcare clients include individual and government sponsored health plans and healthcare providers. We believe that financial services and healthcare providers will increasingly turn to IT solutions, provided by an independent vendor, as a result of economic challenges and heightened regulatory requirements. Financial services firms are in a search for more risk-averse business strategies, simplified regulatory compliance, and full service solutions provided by a single vendor. Healthcare providers are looking to improve their customers’ experience through better access to data and an enhanced user interface. As a result, we believe these industries will continue to invest in IT and outsourcing solutions.
Market Trends
 The demand for our products and services comes from a number of distinct sources: new formations in asset and wealth management and healthcare, new business lines and combinations of business lines at existing clients, replacement of legacy in-house operations and competitor systems and expansion of our existing client relationships. Underlying these demand drivers are several industry trends, including:
 ●Diversification of business lines, product proliferation and complexity. As investment managers look to grow through diversified offerings (alternative assets, real assets, and private equity) in global markets, they need their technology investments and servicing partners to be long-lived and deliver a return on their investment for different types of businesses models. Our scalable solutions empower client growth while diversifying their product offering. Our customers' business models and product offerings are becoming increasingly complex. We aim to simplify organizations and make continuous improvements to our systems to handle complexity. 
 ●Regulatory changes. Our clients must comply with rules, regulations, directives and standards from governmental and self-regulating organizations. Our clients rely on us to navigate new requirements and facilitate compliance in today’s dynamic and evolving regulatory environment. We are uniquely positioned in our ability to interpret regulations and impact to clients and to implement technology solutions. We expect regulatory changes to increase the complexity of compliance and the demand for our products and services and motivate clients to develop systems infrastructure and research management processes to comply with regulatory requirements.
 ●Focus on digital transformation. Evaluating the implications of new technologies is a challenge for our clients. By combining institutional-grade quality with cutting-edge technology, we help apply the right solutions to help grow our client’s business more efficiently. Many of our clients face internal digital transformation projects or external threats from emerging tech disrupter competition. As a result, clients invest in new technology to help expand profit margins and offer new products. In addition, new technology incorporating artificial intelligence (“AI”), including machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”), is gaining traction in the financial technology industry. These next-generation tools will, including our acquisition of Blue Prism in 2022, increase efficiency and reduce errors without human intervention. Overall, we continue to see increasing migration to the cloud to achieve operational scalability and lower fixed costs.
 ●Increased demands for transparency, efficiency and risk management in financial services. Firms continue to focus on operational risk, resulting from discoveries of fraud and mismanagement during the 2008-2009 U.S. financial crisis and concerns regarding transparency and counterparty exposure. This continued focus has led investment management firms to strive to provide investment data accurately, institutionalize investment operations and automate their investment process. On the wealth management and advisory sides of our business, we have further evolved the relationship between the end client and a firm, with investors demanding transparency and a customized client experience. In addition, we expect wealth managers to become familiar with their clients’ preferences for account access and communication and cater to them. Finally, institutional and individual investors, faced with increasingly competitive low-fee and automated options, push investment managers for greater efficiencies and lower fees.
 ●Accelerated adoption of outsourcing and cloud-based solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a number of challenges for our customer base due to the global shift to a remote workforce. SS&C continues to see robust interest in its solutions to drive transformation as customers look to emerge from the crisis with more resilience and agility and expect a lasting effect on the way financial services and healthcare firms conduct business. The post-COVID-19 pandemic environment requires an increased focus on operational efficiency, infrastructure stability, and ability to access systems and data via cloud-based, web-based portals. 
 ●Transformation of healthcare industry’s business model. The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a shift in focus to equitable healthcare. The National Committee for Quality Assurance, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and state regulations 



around health equity are resulting in the need for in-depth, whole-person population segmentation with the ability to include social determinants of health characteristics. New and more stringent guidelines must now be met to satisfy quality ratings and protect revenue. Further changes to the healthcare space come with new policy initiatives that shift the role of the federal government beyond coverage and enrollment into modernizing member-facing plan technology and transparency (such as the Interoperability and No Surprises Act), and managing costs, (either for taxpayers or enrollees) through direct negotiating of drug pricing and direct accrual of rebates. These changes enforce the need for streamlined technology that is flexible and scalable, accurate and reliable analytics, cybersecurity and consumer-directed access to electronic health information. Rapid transformation and market expectations have created an ongoing need for industry expertise and outsourcing, contributing to opportunity.
Competitive Strengths
 The following are the core strengths that we believe enable us to differentiate ourselves in the markets we serve:
 Enhanced capability through software ownership.
We use our proprietary software products and infrastructure to provide our software-enabled services, strengthening our overall operating margins and providing a competitive advantage. Our 2022 acquisition of Blue Prism enables us to deploy Blue Prism's Intelligent Automation Platform and other automation solutions to our clients and to leverage for internal use efficiencies. Because we primarily use our proprietary software to execute our software-enabled services and generally own and control our products’ source code, we can quickly enable continuous updates in a highly scalable, reliable and secure manner. This continuous feedback process provides us with a significant advantage over many of our competitors, specifically those software competitors that do not offer a comparable model and therefore do not have the same level of hands-on experience with their products.
 Global industry leader with a strong market position focused on software and software-enabled services for financial services.
We are a global business providing a broad portfolio of software products and software-enabled services and have approximately 121 offices worldwide. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 24,000 development, service and support professionals with significant expertise across the industries we serve and deep working knowledge of our clients’ businesses. We provide highly flexible, scalable and cost-effective solutions that enable our financial services clients to track complex securities, better employ sophisticated investment strategies, scale efficiently and meet evolving regulatory requirements. Our products and services allow our clients to automate and integrate their front-office, middle-office and back-office functions, thus enabling straight-through processing that increases productivity and reduces costs. We believe our product and service offerings position us as a leader within the specific verticals of the financial services software and services market in which we compete.
Trusted provider to our highly diversified and growing client base.
By providing mission-critical, reliable software products and services for over 35 years, we have developed a large and growing installed base within the financial services industry. Our clients include some of the largest and most well-recognized financial services firms. We believe that our high-quality products and superior services have led to long-term client relationships, some of which date from our earliest days of operations. Our strong client relationships, coupled with the fact that many of our current clients use our products for a relatively small portion of their total funds and investment vehicles under management, provide us with a significant opportunity to sell additional solutions to our existing clients and drive future revenue growth at a lower cost.
 Largest independent alternative fund administration services provider and mutual fund transfer agent.
The third-party service providers participating in the alternative investment market include fund managers, auditors, fund administrators, attorneys, custodians and prime brokers. Each provider performs a valuable function to provide transparency of the fund’s assets and the valuation of those assets. However, conflicts of interest may arise when the above parties offer more than one of these services. The industry is increasingly recognizing these conflicts and, as a result, seeking independent fund administrators such as SS&C.
SS&C is currently the largest fund administrator for alternative investment managers, including hedge funds, private equity, real assets and fund of funds. We are the largest third-party mutual fund transfer agent. Through our Global Investor and Distribution Solutions (“GIDS”) business, we deliver global transfer agency and investor servicing powered by a single global servicing platform. Investor servicing is offered in many different countries, including the U.S., Canada, U.K., Ireland, Luxembourg, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. SS&C also services mutual fund structures in many other fund domiciles. GIDS leverages SS&C’s global regulatory expertise to provide a consistent global approach to regulatory compliance, enabling providers to reduce risk and improve client service. Our highly tenured staff of industry experts allow us to deliver consistent service excellence to the asset management


customers we service. We are operating our proprietary software to provide these services, ensuring all aspects of our offering are optimized to deliver cost-effective, accurate solutions.
 As a publicly-traded company, our clients and prospects have access to our periodic filings with the SEC, giving them transparency into our overall financial strength.
 Data center ownership and SS&C private cloud
 
SS&C owns and operates a global data center footprint to ensure high uptime and regional service delivery for our customers. Our facilities are strategically placed for regional customers and highly scalable. The SS&C Private Cloud delivers our software with very high throughput. Our goal is to manage the infrastructure end-to-end and to limit third-party reliance outside of our control.
 Experienced management team with strong integrating and operating track record.
Our senior management team has a track record of operational excellence, an average of more than 20 years of experience in the financial services and healthcare industries and a proven ability to acquire and integrate complementary businesses, as demonstrated by the 65 businesses we have acquired since 1995. By leveraging our domain expertise and knowledge, we have developed, and continue to improve, our mission-critical software products and services to enable our clients to overcome the complexities inherent in their businesses. In addition, all of our senior executives are compensated based on our financial success.
 Business Strategies
 Our strategy is to deliver compelling solutions and value propositions to our customers in the financial services and healthcare industries. The following are key elements to our strategy for achieving this objective:
 Build upon and extend our leadership position in software and software-enabled services in the financial services industry.
Since our founding in 1986, we have focused on building substantial financial services domain expertise through close working relationships with our clients. We have developed a deep knowledge base that enables us to respond to our clients’ most complex financial, accounting, actuarial, tax and regulatory needs. We intend to maintain and enhance our technological leadership by using our domain expertise to build valuable new software-enabled services and solutions, investing in internal development and opportunistically acquiring products and services that address the highly specialized needs of the financial services industry.
 Our internal product development team works closely with marketing, sales and client service personnel to ensure that product evolution reflects developments in the marketplace and trends in client requirements. In addition, we intend to continue to develop our products cost-effectively by leveraging common components across product families. As a result, we believe that we enjoy a competitive advantage because we can address the needs of high-end clients by providing industry-tested products and services, including cloud-based services and related mobility platforms that meet global market demands and enable our clients to automate and integrate functions for improved productivity, compliance, reduced manual intervention and bottom-line savings.
 SS&C’s products are sold to a diverse group of clients from niche players in the financial services and healthcare industries to the largest institutions in the world. Furthermore, we believe our client base represents a fraction of the total number of financial services providers globally. We believe we can grow our client base over time as our products become more widely adopted. We believe we also have an opportunity to capitalize on the increasing adoption of mission-critical outsourcing operations by financial services and healthcare providers as they continue to replace inadequate legacy solutions and custom in-house solutions that are inflexible and costly to maintain. We also believe we have an opportunity to expand our footprint within existing clients. We will continue to focus on cross-selling our products and bundling solutions. Our software-enabled services revenues increased from $3,891.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $4,273.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
 Capitalize on longer-term secular growth trends in financial services and healthcare industries.
With our global footprint and best-in-class product offerings, we aim to capture a significant share of the IT spend of alternative asset, institutional and retail asset managers, wealth managers and the healthcare industry through leveraging the deeply embedded service offering we provide and outdistancing the competition. We expect regulatory changes to increase the complexity of compliance and the demand for our products and services and motivate clients to develop infrastructure and research management processes to mitigate regulatory exposure. We plan to benefit from the growing software spend in the increasingly complex and more highly regulated financial services and healthcare landscape.



Continue to capitalize on acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies.
We intend to continue to employ a highly disciplined and focused acquisition strategy to broaden and enhance our product and service offerings, expand our intellectual property portfolio, add new clients and supplement our internal development efforts. We believe our acquisitions have been an extension of our research and development effort that has enabled us to purchase proven products and remove the uncertainties associated with software development projects. We will seek to opportunistically acquire, at reasonable valuations, businesses, products and technologies in our existing or complementary vertical markets that will enable us to better satisfy our clients’ rigorous and evolving needs. We have proven our ability to integrate complementary businesses as demonstrated by the 65 businesses we have acquired since 1995. Our experienced senior management team leads a rigorous evaluation of our targets to ensure that they satisfy our product or service needs and will successfully integrate with our business while meeting our targeted financial goals. As a result, our acquisitions have contributed marketable products or services that have added to our revenues. Through the broad reach of our direct sales force and our large installed client base, we believe we can market these acquired products and services to a large number of prospective clients. Additionally, we have improved the operational performance and profitability of our acquired businesses, creating significant value for our stockholders.
 Strengthen our international presence.
We believe there is a significant market opportunity to provide software and services to financial services providers outside North America. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 25% of our revenues from clients outside North America. We are building our international operations to increase our sales outside North America. We plan to continue to expand our global market presence by leveraging our existing software products and software-enabled services. We also plan to leverage our growing presence in the Asia Pacific region due to recent acquisitions. Over the last three years, revenue from the Asia Pacific region has increased 33.6% to $258.2 million. We believe this region presents a compelling growth opportunity.
Increase profitability through margin expansion.
 We expect to drive increased margins by delivering innovative end-to-end solutions that provide significant value to customers and warrant premium pricing. We have a significant scale with best-in-class solutions and software-enabled services across the delivery spectrum, which, we believe, combined with a diversified service offering and client base, drives stable revenues and increased operating leverage. In addition, our operating flexibility allows us to scale our costs based on client demands. We can also increase our margins by implementing more technology in our services business, including automating traditionally manual accounting functions and utilization of the Blue Prism intelligent automation platform.
 Along with the productivity improvements mentioned above, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and SS&C's flexible working policy, we believe we can reduce our real estate footprint and related costs over the medium term.
Our Acquisitions
 As mentioned above, we intend to employ a highly disciplined and focused acquisition strategy. Our past acquisitions have enabled us to expand our product and service offerings into new markets or client bases within the financial services industry. New products and services have also enabled us to market other products and services to acquired client bases. In addition, we believe our acquisitions have been an extension of our research and development effort and have enabled us to add to our product and service offerings without incurring the uncertainties sometimes associated with software development projects.
 Since 1995, we have acquired 65 businesses within our industry. These acquisitions have contributed marketable products and services, which have added to our revenues and earnings. We have generally been able to improve our acquired businesses’ operating performance and profitability. We seek to reduce the costs of the acquired businesses by consolidating sales and marketing efforts and eliminating redundant administrative tasks and research and development expenses. In many cases, we have also increased revenues generated by acquired products and services by leveraging our existing products and services, larger sales capabilities and client base.



We generally seek to acquire companies that satisfy our financial metrics, including expected return on investment. Through our acquisitions, we seek companies that:
 ●provide complementary products or services in the financial services industries;
 ●possess proven technology and an established client base that will provide a source of ongoing revenue and to whom we may be able to sell existing products and services;
 ●expand our intellectual property portfolio to complement our business;
 ●address a highly specialized problem or a market niche in the financial services and healthcare industries;
 ●expand our global reach into strategic geographic markets; and
 ●have solutions that lend themselves to being delivered as software-enabled services.
 Based on our experience, we believe numerous solution providers address highly particularized financial services needs or provide specialized services that would meet our disciplined acquisition criteria.

We provide our larger clients with a dedicated client support team whose primary responsibility is to answer questions and provide solutions to address ongoing needs. Direct telephone support is provided during extended business hours and additional hours are available during peak periods. We distribute content-rich, periodic blogs and thought leadership targeted at clients and prospects in each of our vertical and geographic markets. We supplement our service and support activities with comprehensive training.

Sales and Marketing
 We believe a direct sales organization is essential in successfully implementing our business strategy, given the complexity and importance of the operations and information managed by our products, the extensive regulatory and reporting requirements of each industry, and the unique dynamics of each vertical market. Our dedicated direct sales and support personnel are located in various sales offices worldwide and routinely undergo product and sales training. We also use telemarketing to support sales of our real estate property management products and work through alliance partners that sell our software-enabled services to their correspondent banking clients.
 Our marketing personnel has extensive experience in marketing to the financial services and healthcare industries. They are responsible for identifying market trends, evaluating and developing marketing opportunities, generating client leads and providing sales support. In addition, our marketing activities focus on cost-effective means of reaching current and potential clients, including:

 ●publishing and distributing thought leadership white papers or articles to appropriate press outlets;
 ●hosting regular product-focused webinars;
 ●sponsoring virtual and physical seminars and events, speaking engagements and symposiums; and
 ●delivering digital, integrated marketing programs.
 This strategy achieves lower marketing costs, more direct contacts with actual and potential clients, increased marketing leads, distribution of more up-to-date marketing information and an improved ability to measure marketing initiatives.
 The marketing department also supports the sales force with appropriate and relevant materials, including brochures and fact sheets, for use during the sales process.

We use multidisciplinary teams of highly trained personnel to meet these goals and leverage this expertise across all product lines.

Maintaining and improving the integrity, quality and functionality of existing products is the responsibility of individual product managers. Product engineering management efforts focus on enterprise-wide strategies, implementing best-practice technology regimens, maximizing resources and mapping out an integration plan for our entire umbrella of products as well as third-party products. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our research and development expenses were $447.3 million, $414.9 million and $399.4 million, respectively. In addition, we have made significant investments in intellectual property through our acquisitions.

We have generally issued a major release of our core products during the second or third quarter of each fiscal year, including both functional and technical enhancements.
Competition
 The market for the software and services we provide is competitive, rapidly evolving and highly sensitive to new product introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants, although high conversion costs can create barriers to adoption of new products or technologies. The market is fragmented and served by both large-scale firms with broad offerings as well as firms that target only local markets or specific types of clients. We also face competition from information systems developed and serviced internally by the IT departments of large financial services and healthcare firms. We believe that we generally compete effectively as to the factors identified for each market below, although some of our existing competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, distribution and marketing resources than we have and may offer products with different functions or features that are more attractive to potential customers than our offerings.

 Proprietary Rights
 We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent law, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology. We have registered trademarks for many of our products and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, distributors, clients and potential clients. We seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford limited protection. These efforts may be insufficient to prevent third-parties from asserting intellectual property rights in our technology. Furthermore, it may be possible for unauthorized third-parties to copy portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use proprietary information, and third-parties may assert ownership rights in our proprietary technology. For additional risks relating to our proprietary technology, please see “Risk Factors — Risks “Relating to Our Business”. If we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and other confidential information, our success and our ability to compete will be subject to various risks, such as third-party infringement claims, unauthorized use of our technology, disclosure of our proprietary information or inability to license technology from third-parties.



Rapid technological change characterizes the software development industry. We believe factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable service and support are more important to establishing and maintaining a leadership position than legal protections of our technology.
