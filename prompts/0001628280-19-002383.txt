Item 1 - Business
General
United Security Bancshares is a California corporation incorporated in March 2001 and is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”). The stock of United Security Bancshares is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “UBFO.”

United Security Bank was chartered under the laws of the State of California in 1987 as a commercial bank. On June 12, 2001, United Security Bank reorganized into the bank holding company form of ownership and thereby became the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Security Bancshares and each share of United Security Bank stock was exchanged for a share of United Security Bancshares stock on a one-to-one basis. The principal business of United Security Bancshares is to serve as the holding company for United Security Bank. 
References to the “Bank” refer to United Security Bank together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, USB Investment Trust Inc., a special purpose real estate investment trust organized under the laws of the State of Maryland. References to “we,” “us,” or the “Company” refer to United Security Bancshares together with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. References to the “Holding Company,” refer to United Security Bancshares, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis.
United Security Bank 
The Bank is a California state-chartered bank headquartered in Fresno, California. At December 31, 2018, the Bank operates three branches (including its main office), one construction lending office, and one commercial lending office in Fresno, California and one branch each, in Oakhurst, Caruthers, San Joaquin, Firebaugh, Coalinga, Bakersfield, Taft, and Campbell, California. The Bank has ATMs at all branch locations and off-site ATMs at nine different non-branch locations. In addition, the Holding Company and the Bank have administrative headquarters located at 2126 Inyo Street, Fresno, California, 93721. 
USB Investment Trust Inc.
USB Investment Trust Inc. was incorporated effective December 31, 2001 as a special purpose real estate investment trust (REIT) under Maryland law. The REIT is a subsidiary of the Bank and was funded with $133.0 million in real estate-secured loans contributed by the Bank. USB Investment Trust was originally formed to give the Bank flexibility in raising capital, and reduce the expenses associated with holding the assets contributed to USB Investment Trust. The REIT also provided state tax benefits beginning in 2002. 
USB Capital Trust II
During July 2007, the Holding Company formed USB Capital Trust II as a wholly-owned special purpose entity for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities. USB Capital Trust II is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) and a deconsolidated entity pursuant to current accounting standards related to variable interest entities. On July 23, 2007, USB Capital Trust II issued $15 million in Trust Preferred Securities. These securities have a thirty-year maturity and bear a floating rate of interest (repricing quarterly) of 1.29% over the three-month LIBOR rate. Interest is payable quarterly. Concurrent with the issuance of the Trust Preferred Securities, USB Capital Trust II used the proceeds of the Trust Preferred Securities offering to purchase a like amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by the Holding Company. The Holding Company pays interest on the junior subordinated debentures to USB Capital Trust II, which represents the sole source of dividend distributions to the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities. Effective September 30, 2009 and beginning with the quarterly interest payment due October 1, 2009, the Holding Company elected to defer interest payments on the $15.0 million of junior subordinated debentures relating to the Trust Preferred Securities. The terms of the debentures and trust indentures allow for the Holding Company to defer interest payments for up to 20 consecutive quarters without default or penalty. During this deferral period, the Holding Company continued to record interest expense associated with the debentures. As of June 30, 2014, the Company ended the extension period, paid all accrued and unpaid interest and, as of December 31, 2018, was current on its quarterly interest payments. During 2015, $3.0 million of the $15.0 million principal balance of the subordinated debentures related to the Trust Preferred Securities was purchased by the Bank and subsequently purchased by the Company. The Company redeemed the $3.0 million in par value of the subordinated debentures, resulting in a remaining contractual principal balance of $12.0 million since year-end 2015. The Company may redeem the junior subordinated debentures at any time at par. 
The following discussion of our services should be read in conjunction with "Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS."
Bank Services
We offer a full range of commercial banking services primarily to the business and professional community and individuals located in Fresno, Madera, Kern, and Santa Clara Counties, including a variety of deposit instruments including personal and business checking accounts and savings accounts, interest-bearing negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, money market accounts and time certificates of deposit. Most of our deposits are comprised of accounts from individuals and from small- and medium-sized business-related sources. Time deposits have provided a significant portion of the Bank’s deposit base amounting to 10.23% and 9.43% of total deposits at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
4

We also offer a full complement of lending activities, including real estate mortgage (49.2% of total loans at December 31, 2018), commercial and industrial (9.7% of total loans at December 31, 2018), real estate construction (18.5% of total loans at December 31, 2018), as well as agricultural (10.4% of total loans at December 31, 2018), and installment loans (12.2% of total loans at December 31, 2018). Approximately 67.7% of our loans are secured by real estate at December 31, 2018. A loan may be secured (in whole or in part) by real estate even though the purpose of the loan is not to facilitate the purchase or development of real estate. At December 31, 2018, we had loans (net of unearned fees) outstanding of $587,814,000, which represented approximately 73.0% of our total deposits and approximately 63.0% of our total assets.

Our real estate mortgage loans are secured by deeds of trust primarily on commercial property. The repayment of real estate mortgage loans generally is from the cash flow of the borrower. Commercial and industrial loans have a high degree of industry diversification. Our loans may be originated in our market area, or participated with other financial institutions outside our market area. A substantial portion of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, leases or other collateral. The remainder are unsecured. However, extensions of credit are predicated on the financial capacity of the borrower to repay. Repayment of commercial loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower. Our real estate construction loans consist of loans to residential contractors, which are secured by single-family residential properties. All real estate loans have established equity requirements. The repayment of real estate construction loans is generally from long-term mortgages with other lending institutions. Our agricultural loans are generally secured by land, equipment, inventory and receivables. Repayment of agricultural loans is generally from the expected cash flow of the borrower.
Although we have a high concentration of commercial real estate loans, we are not in the business of making residential mortgage loans to individuals. Residential mortgage loans totaled $59,431,000, or 10.11% of the portfolio at December 31, 2018. The residential mortgage loan portfolio is primarily comprised of purchased residential mortgage pools. We do not originate, or have in our loan portfolio, any subprime, Alt-A, or option adjustable rate loans. We do originate interest-only loans which are generally revolving lines of credit to commercial and agricultural businesses or for real estate development where the borrowers business may be seasonal or cash flows may be restricted until the completion of the project. In addition, we have restructured certain loans to allow the borrower to continue to perform on the loan under a troubled debt restructuring plan. 
We purchase loan participations from, and sell loan participations to, other financial institutions. The underwriting standards for loan participations or purchases are the same as non-participated loans, and are subject to the same limitations, collateral requirements, and borrower requirements. We have reduced our level of loan participations over the past several years and as of December 31, 2018, we do not have any participation purchased loans. Loan participations sold comprised 1.2% and 1.3% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In the normal course of business, we make various loan commitments and incur certain contingent liabilities. Due to the nature of the business of our customers, there is no absolute predictability to the utilization of unused loan commitments and therefore, we are unable to forecast the extent to which these commitments will be exercised within the current year. Although we can provide no assurances, we do not believe that any such utilization will constitute a material liquidity demand. The Company does however have collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit which could be utilized if such loan commitments were to be exercised in excess of normal expectations.
In addition to the loan and deposit services discussed above we also offer a wide range of specialized services designed to attract and service the needs of commercial customers and account holders. These services include online banking, mobile banking, safe deposit boxes, Interactive (Virtual) Teller "ITM" services, ATM services, payroll direct deposit, cashier's checks, and cash management services. We do not operate a trust department; however, we make arrangements with our correspondent bank to offer trust services to our customers upon request. Most of our business originates within Fresno, Madera, Kern, and Santa Clara Counties.

Competition and Market Share
The banking business in California generally, and in the market areas we serve specifically, is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits. We compete for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, money market funds, credit unions and other financial institutions, including a number that are substantially larger than us. We compete for loans and deposits by offering competitive interest rates and by seeking to provide a higher level of personalized service than is generally offered by larger competitors. Regulatory restrictions on interstate bank branching and acquisitions and on banks providing a broader array of financial services, such as securities underwriting and insurance, have been reduced or eliminated. The availability of banking services over the Internet and on mobile devices continues to expand. Changes in laws and regulations governing the financial services industry cannot be predicted; however, past legislation has served to 
5

intensify the competitive environment. Many of the major commercial banks operating in our market areas offer certain services such as trust and international banking services, which we do not offer directly. In addition, banks with larger capitalization have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve larger customers.
Our primary market area at December 31, 2018 was located in Fresno, Madera, and Kern Counties, within California, in which approximately 30 FDIC-insured financial institutions compete for business. Santa Clara County was added during February 2007, with the Legacy Bank acquisition, in which approximately 50 FDIC-insured financial institutions compete for business. The following table sets forth information regarding deposit market share and ranking by county as of June 30, 2018, which is the most current information available.

 | Rank | Share
Fresno County | 8th | 4.30%
Madera County | 8th | 6.16%
Kern County | 14th | 0.76%
Total of Fresno, Madera, Kern Counties | 7th | 3.08%
Santa Clara County | 43rd | 0.01%

Supervision and Regulation
Introduction
We are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state banking laws that establish a comprehensive framework for our operations. Such regulation is intended to, among other things, protect the interests of customers, including depositors, and the federal deposit insurance fund, as well as to minimize risk to the banking system as a whole. These regulations are not, however, generally charged with protecting the interests of our shareholders or creditors. Described below are elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to our Holding Company and/or our Bank. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. Changes in applicable law or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted, and they may have a material effect on the business, operations, and results of our Company or the Bank. Recent political developments, including the change in the political composition of the U.S. Congress and the ongoing investigation of the current administration, have added additional uncertainty to the implementation, scope, and timing of regulatory reforms, including those related to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”).
The following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations. This discussion is also qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text and to the implementation and enforcement of the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
Substantial changes to the regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have occurred as a result of the enactment in 2010 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their application by regulatory agencies, have had and will continue to have a material effect on the business and results of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulatory framework for financial services companies, and since its enactment has required significant rulemaking and numerous studies and reports. Among other things, it created a new Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “Council”) with broad authority to make recommendations covering enhanced prudential standards and more stringent supervision for large bank holding companies and certain non-bank financial services companies. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly reduced interchange fees on debit card transactions, changed the preemption of state laws applicable to national banks, increased the regulation of consumer mortgage banking and made numerous other changes.
In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act, other legislative and regulatory proposals affecting banks have been made in recent years both domestically and internationally. Among other things, these proposals include significant additional capital and liquidity requirements and limitations on the size or types of activity in which banks may engage. 
The Holding Company
6

General
The Holding Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is registered with, and regulated and examined by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or FRB. In addition, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation and periodic examination, principally by the California Department of Business Oversight, or DBO and, as a member bank, the FRB. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, insures the Bank's deposits up to certain prescribed limits. The Holding Company is also subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and through the listing of its common stock on NASDAQ, the Holding Company is subject to the listing standards and rules of NASDAQ.
Source of Strength
The Dodd-Frank Act codified existing FRB policy requiring the Holding Company to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank, and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so. However, because the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators, the GLBA prohibits the FRB from requiring payment by a holding company to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment. In those cases, the FRB could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, non-bank subsidiaries of a holding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured depository institution must be examined and regulated in a manner that is at least as stringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository institution of the holding company.
Bank Holding Company Liquidity
As a legal entity, separate and distinct from the Bank, the Holding Company has the ability to raise capital on its own behalf or borrow from external sources. We may also obtain additional funds from dividends paid by, and fees charged for services provided to, the Bank. However, regulatory constraints on the Bank may restrict or totally preclude the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Holding Company.
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
The Holding Company and any subsidiaries it may purchase or organize are deemed to be affiliates of the Bank within the meaning of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, and the FRB's Regulation W. Under Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W, loans by the Bank to affiliates, investments by them in affiliates' stock, and taking affiliates' stock as collateral for loans to any borrower is limited to 10% of the Bank's capital, in the case of any one affiliate, and is limited to 20% of the Bank's capital, in the case of all affiliates. In addition, transactions between the Bank and other affiliates must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices, in particular, a bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase from an affiliate a low-quality asset, as defined in the Federal Reserve Act. These restrictions also prevent a bank holding company and its other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the bank holding company unless the loans are secured by marketable collateral of designated amounts.

The Holding Company and the Bank are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting, public sale and distribution of securities. 
The Federal Reserve Act and FRB Regulation O place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to a bank or bank holding company’s executive officers, directors and principal shareholders; any company controlled by any such executive officer, director or shareholder; or any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer, director or principal shareholder. Additionally, such loans or extensions of credit must comply with loan-to-one-borrower limits; require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts; must be made on substantially the same and follow credit-underwriting procedures no less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-insiders; must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and must not exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus in the aggregate.
Limitations on Business and Investment Activities
7

Under the BHCA, a bank holding company must obtain the FRB’s approval before: (i) directly or indirectly acquiring more than 5% ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company; (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank; (iii) or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.
The FRB may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States without regard to whether the acquisition is prohibited by the law of the state in which the target bank is located. In approving interstate acquisitions, however, the FRB must give effect to applicable state laws limiting the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institutions in the state in which the target bank is located, provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state depository institutions or their holding companies, and state laws which require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. 
In addition to owning or managing banks, bank holding companies may own subsidiaries engaged in certain businesses that the FRB has determined to be “so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.” The Holding Company, therefore, is permitted to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses. 
Additionally, qualifying bank holding companies making an appropriate election to the FRB may engage in a full range of financial activities, including insurance, securities and merchant banking. The Holding Company has not elected to qualify for these financial services.
Federal law prohibits a bank holding company and any subsidiary banks from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit. Thus, for example, the Bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any services, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that: 

• | the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from or to the Bank other than a loan, discount, deposit or trust services;


• | the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property or service from or to the Holding Company or any subsidiaries; or


• | the customer must not obtain some other credit, property or services from competitors, except reasonable requirements to assure soundness of credit extended.

Capital Adequacy
Bank holding companies must maintain minimum levels of capital under the FRB’s risk-based capital adequacy guidelines. If capital falls below minimum guideline levels, a bank holding company, among other things, may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses. 
The FRB’s risk-based capital adequacy guidelines, discussed in more detail below in the section entitled “Capital Standards,” assign various risk percentages to different categories of assets and capital are measured as a percentage of risk assets. Under the terms of the guidelines, bank holding companies are expected to meet capital adequacy guidelines based both on total risk assets and on total assets, without regard to risk weights. 
The risk-based guidelines are minimum requirements. Higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual organizations. For example, the FRB’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Moreover, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth or expansion into new activities, particularly under the expanded powers under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions, well above the minimum levels.
Limitations on Dividend Payments
As applicable to the Holding Company, California Corporations Code Section 500 provides that neither the Holding Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall make a distribution to the Holding Company’s shareholders unless the board of directors has determined in good faith that either:

• | The amount of retained earnings of the Holding Company immediately prior to the distribution equals or exceeds the sum of (A) the amount of the proposed distribution plus (B) the preferential dividends arrears amount; or

8


• | Immediately after the distribution, the value of the Holding Company's assets would equal or exceed the sum of its total liabilities plus the preferential rights amount.

Additionally, the FRB’s policy regarding dividends provides that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends exceeding its net income or which can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations.
Securities Registration and Listing
Our common stock is registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act and, as a result, we are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading, corporate governance, and other disclosure requirements and restrictions of the Exchange Act, as well as the Securities Act, both administered by the SEC. We are required to file annual, quarterly and other current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site, http://www.sec.gov, at which our filings with the SEC may be accessed. Our SEC filings are also available on our website at http://investors.unitedsecuritybank.com/Docs.
Our common stock is listed on NASDAQ and trades under the symbol “UBFO.” As a company listed on NASDAQ, we are subject to NASDAQ standards for listed companies. NASDAQ has also adopted corporate governance rules, which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors.
The Bank
As a California state-chartered bank and a member of the FRB, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the FRB, and the DBO. The Bank is subject to California laws insofar as they are not preempted by federal banking law. Deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits in an amount up to $250,000 per customer and, as such, the Bank is subject to the applicable provisions of the FDIA and the regulations of the FDIC. As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in California and the United States, the Bank’s business is particularly susceptible to changes in California and federal legislation and regulation, which may have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting permissible activities or increasing competition.
Various other requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States and the State of California affect the operations of the Bank. Federal and California statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the Bank’s operations, including capital requirements and disclosure requirements to depositors and borrowers, requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, limitations on interest rates payable on deposits, loans, investments, and restrictions on borrowings and on payment of dividends. The DBO regulates the number and location of branch offices of a state-chartered bank, and may permit a bank to maintain branches only to the extent allowable under state law for state banks. California law presently permits a bank to locate a branch in any locality in the state. Additionally, California law exempts banks from California usury laws.
Capital Standards
In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act, the international oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, or Basel III, reached agreements that introduced a minimum common equity tier 1 capital requirement of 4.50 percent, along with a capital conservation buffer of 2.50 percent to bring total common equity capital requirements to 7.00 percent. The federal banking agencies issued final rules that implemented Basel III and certain other revisions to the Basel capital framework, as well as the minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements of the Dodd Frank Act. Federal regulators periodically propose amendments to the risk-based capital guidelines and the related regulatory framework and consider changes to the capital standards that could significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet applicable standards. The timing of adoption, ultimate form and effect of any such proposed amendments cannot be determined at this time.
The following are among the requirements that were phased in beginning January 1, 2015:


• | An increase in the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.00% to 6.00% of risk-weighted assets;


• | A new category and a required 4.50% of risk-weighted assets ratio is established for “common equity Tier 1” as a subset of Tier 1 capital limited to common equity;


• | A minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio is set at 4.00% eliminating a 3.00% exception for higher rated banks;

9


• | Changes in the permitted composition of Tier 1 capital to exclude trust preferred securities, mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets and include unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities;


• | An additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over each of the required capital ratios will be phased in beginning January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets until fully implemented in January 2019. This conservation buffer level must be met to avoid limitations on the ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses;


• | The risk weights of certain assets for purposes of calculating the risk-based capital ratios are changed for high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans, certain past due non-residential mortgage loans and certain mortgage-backed and other securities exposures; and


• | An additional “countercyclical capital buffer” is required for larger and more complex institutions.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank were "well-capitalized" under these capital standards. The regulatory capital guidelines as well as the actual capitalization for the Bank and the Company as of December 31, 2018 are set forth under the section entitled “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS - Regulatory Matters - Capital Adequacy.”
Liquidity Requirements
Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, both in the U.S. and internationally, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward will be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high‑quality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30‑day time horizon (or, if greater, then 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”), is designed to promote more medium‑ and long‑term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one‑year time horizon. These requirements will incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long‑term debt as a funding source.
In September 2014, the federal banking agencies approved final rules implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approach banking organizations, neither of which apply to the Company or the Bank. On October 31, 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued its final standards for the NSFR, entitled “Basel III: The Net Stable Funding Ratio.” On May 3, 2016, the FRB issued a proposed requiring bank holding companies to maintain a minimum level of stable funding relative to the liquidity of their assets, derivatives, and commitments, over a one-year period and to publicly disclose information about their NSFR levels each quarter. However, this proposed rule would not apply to holding companies with less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets and would not apply to community banks and, therefore, would not apply to the Company and the Bank.
Prompt Corrective Action
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (“FDICIA”) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FRB promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: 
Under the regulations, a bank shall be deemed to be:

• | “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or more, has a leverage capital ratio of 5% or more and is not subject to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure;

10


• | “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or more and a leverage capital ratio of 4% or more (3% under certain circumstances) and does not meet the definition of “well capitalized”;


• | “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4%, or a leverage capital ratio that is less than 4% (3% under certain circumstances)


• | “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3% or a leverage capital ratio that is less than 3%; and


• | “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.

A bank’s category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.
While these benchmarks have not changed, due to market turbulence, the regulators have strongly encouraged and, in many instances, required, banks and bank holding companies to achieve and maintain higher ratios as a matter of safety and soundness. 
Banks are prohibited from paying dividends or management fees to controlling persons or entities if, after making the payment, the bank would be “undercapitalized,” that is, the bank fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. Asset growth and branching restrictions apply to “undercapitalized” banks. Banks classified as “undercapitalized” are required to submit acceptable capital plans guaranteed by its holding company, if any. Broad regulatory authority was granted with respect to “significantly undercapitalized” banks, including forced mergers, growth restrictions, ordering new elections for directors, forcing divestiture by its holding company, if any, requiring management changes and prohibiting the payment of bonuses to senior management. Even more severe restrictions are applicable to “critically undercapitalized” banks. Restrictions for these banks include the appointment of a receiver or conservator. All of the federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement this system of prompt corrective action. 
A bank, based upon its capital levels, that is classified as “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. Further, a bank that otherwise meets the capital levels to be categorized as “well capitalized,” will be deemed to be “adequately capitalized,” if the bank is subject to a written agreement requiring that the bank maintain specific capital levels. At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions. The federal banking agencies, however, may not treat an institution as “critically undercapitalized” unless its capital ratios actually warrant such treatment. 
In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, the issuance of a cease-and-desist order that can be judicially enforced, the termination of insurance of deposits (in the case of a depository institution), the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, the issuance of formal and informal agreements, the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties. The enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders may be based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.
In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, commercial banking organizations, such as the Bank, may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal or state banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, the issuance of a cease‑and‑desist order that can be judicially enforced, the termination of insurance for deposits (in the case of a depository institution), the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, the issuance of formal and informal agreements, the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution‑affiliated parties. The enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders may be based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.

Premiums for Deposit Insurance
11

The deposit insurance fund of the FDIC insures our customers’ deposits up to prescribed limits for each depositor.  In October 2010, the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) adopted a new restoration plan to ensure that the deposit insurance fund (the “DIF”) reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020.   At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increase or decrease assessment rates.  On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule modifying the risk-based assessment system from a domestic deposit base to a scorecard based assessment system, effective April 1, 2011.  Effective as of April 1, 2011, the Bank was categorized as a small institution as the Bank has less than $10 billion in assets.   After potential adjustments related to unsecured debt and brokered deposit balances, the final total assessment rates range from 2.5 to 45 basis points.  Initial base assessment rates for small institutions ranged from five to 35 basis points.  Any material increase in assessments or the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, depending on the amount of the increase.  Furthermore, the FDIC is authorized to raise insurance premiums under certain circumstances.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the “Reform Act”) increased the deposit insurance limit for certain retirement plan deposit accounts from $100,000 to $250,000 and the Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the current standard maximum federal deposit insurance amount from $100,000 to $250,000 per qualified account.
The FDIC is authorized to terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency.  The termination of deposit insurance would result in the forced closure of the Bank which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the “FHLB-SF”).  Among other benefits, each Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region.  Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system.  Each FHLB makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the individual FHLB. The FHLB-SF utilizes a single class of stock with a par value of $100 per share, which may be issued, exchanged, redeemed and repurchased only at par value. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own FHLB –SF capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of:

• | a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of $25 million (100% of “membership asset value” as defined), or


• | an activity based stock requirement (based on percentage of outstanding advances).

The FHLB – SF capital stock is redeemable on five years written notice, subject to certain conditions. At December 31, 2018 the Bank owned 28,228 shares of the FHLB-SF capital stock.
Federal Reserve Bank 
The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts and non-personal time deposits.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with these requirements.
Consumer Regulation
We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection regulations may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.

The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB is also authorized to engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data, and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. The Bank is subject to direct oversight and examination by the CFPB. The CFPB has broad supervisory, examination, and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. The CFPB also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief or monetary penalties. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
USA PATRIOT Act and Anti-Money Laundering
The PATRIOT Act, designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain access to the United States financial system, has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The PATRIOT Act, as implemented by various federal regulatory agencies, requires the Company and the Bank to establish and implement policies and procedures with respect to, among other matters, anti‑money laundering, compliance, suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers and prospective customers. The PATRIOT Act and its underlying regulations permit information sharing for counter‑terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, subject to certain conditions, and require the FRB, the FDIC and other federal banking agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when considering a bank holding company acquisition and/or a bank merger act application.

We regularly evaluate and continue to enhance our systems and procedures to continue to comply with the PATRIOT Act and other anti‑money laundering initiatives. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational consequences for the institution and result in material fines and sanctions.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, designated nationals and others. These rules are based on their administration by OFAC. The OFAC‑administered sanctions targeting designated countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment‑related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational consequences, and result in civil money penalties on the Company and the Bank.
Community Reinvestment Act
The CRA generally requires the Bank to identify the communities it serves and to make loans and investments, offer products, make donations in, and provide services designed to meet the credit needs of these communities. The CRA also requires the Bank to maintain comprehensive records of its CRA activities to demonstrate how we are meeting the credit needs of our communities. These documents are subject to periodic examination by the FDIC. During these examinations, the FDIC rates such institutions’ compliance with CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” The CRA requires the FDIC to take into account the record of a bank in meeting the credit needs of all of the communities served, including low‑and moderate‑income neighborhoods, in determining such rating. Failure of an institution to receive at least a “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit such institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions. The Bank received a CRA rating of “Satisfactory” as of its most recent examination. In the case of a bank holding company, such as the Company, when applying to acquire a bank, savings association, or a bank holding company, the FRB will assess the CRA record of each depository institution of the applicant bank holding company in considering the application.
Customer Information Privacy and Cybersecurity
The FRB and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal, non‑public customer information. These guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its 
13

board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information, and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. We have adopted a customer information security program to comply with these requirements.
In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing Internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. For a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" included in this Form 10-K.
Privacy
The GLBA and the California Financial Information Privacy Act require financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of non-public personal information about consumers to non‑affiliated third parties. In general, the statutes require disclosures to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such non-public personal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibit disclosing such information except as provided in the Bank’s policies and procedures. We have implemented privacy policies addressing these restrictions that are distributed regularly to all existing and new customers of the Bank.
Other Aspects of Banking Law
The Bank is also subject to federal statutory and regulatory provisions covering, among other things, security procedures, management interlocks, funds availability and truth-in-savings. There are also a variety of federal statutes that regulate acquisitions of control and the formation of bank holding companies, and the activities beyond owning banks that are permissible.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, the Company employed 125 persons on a full-time equivalent basis. The Company believes its employee relations are excellent.
