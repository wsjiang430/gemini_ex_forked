 Recent Events 
 Acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. 
 On February 1, 2019, we completed our previously announced acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc., an Oregon corporation (ESI), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ESI Merger). ESI is an innovator in laser-based manufacturing solutions for micro-machining applications. Micro-machining applications are used extensively in the manufacture of mobile devices, electronic components, thin film devices and semiconductor packaging. At the effective time of the ESI Merger and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each share of ESIs common stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger was converted into the right to receive $30.00 per share in cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax. We paid to the former ESI stockholders aggregate consideration of approximately $1 billion, excluding related transaction fees and expenses. We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and proceeds from our term loan facility described below. 
 In connection with the completion of the ESI Merger, we entered into an amendment (Amendment No. 5) to our Term Loan Credit Agreement with Barclays Bank PLC as administrative agent and collateral agent, that provided additional tranche B-5 term loan commitment in the principal amount of $650.0 million, which we used to partially fund the ESI Merger. 
 Also, in connection with the completion of the ESI Merger, we terminated our $50.0 million asset-based credit agreement with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch as administrative and collateral agent, and we entered into an asset-based credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, that provides senior secured revolving credit financing of up to $100.0 million, subject to a borrowing base limitation.

 Other Dispositions and Acquisitions 
 Sale of Data Analytics Solutions Business 
 In April 2017, we completed the sale of our Data Analytics Solutions business for total proceeds of $72.5 million, net of cash sold and recorded a pre-tax gain of $74.9 million. This business, which had net revenues in 2016 of $12.7 million and was included in our Vacuum & Analysis segment, was no longer a part of our long-term strategic objectives. The business did not qualify as a discontinued operation as this sale did not represent a strategic shift in our business, nor did the sale have a major effect on our operations. Therefore, the results of operations for all periods are included in our income from operations. The assets and liabilities of this business have not been reclassified or segregated in the consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statements of cash flows as the amounts were immaterial. 
Acquisition of Newport Corporation 
 On April 29, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Newport Corporation (Newport) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of February 22, 2016 (the Newport Merger). At the effective time of the Newport Merger, each share of Newports common stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Newport Merger was converted into the right to receive $23.00 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax. We paid to the former Newport stockholders aggregate consideration of approximately $905 million, excluding related transaction fees and expenses, and repaid approximately $93 million of Newports U.S. indebtedness outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Newport Merger. We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand of approximately $240 million and the proceeds from the senior secured term loan facility in the principal amount of $780 million (see Note 13 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Newport was a global supplier of advanced-technology products and systems to customers in the scientific research and defense/security, microelectronics, life and health sciences and industrial manufacturing markets. 
Reportable Segments 
 Effective April 29, 2016, in conjunction with our acquisition of Newport, we changed the structure of our reportable segments based upon our organizational structure and how our Chief Operating Decision Maker utilizes information provided to allocate resources and make decisions. Our two reportable segments are the Vacuum & Analysis segment and the Light & Motion segment. The Vacuum & Analysis segment represents primarily the legacy MKS business and the Light & Motion segment represents the remaining legacy Newport business. With the acquisition of ESI, we will be adding a third segment.

We typically provide warranties for periods ranging from one to three years, depending upon the type of product, with the majority of our products ranging from one to two years. We typically provide warranty on our repair services for periods ranging from 90 days to up to one year, depending upon the type of repair. 
 Research and Development 
 Our products incorporate sophisticated technologies to measure, monitor, deliver, analyze, power and control complex semiconductor and advanced manufacturing processes, thereby enhancing uptime, yield and throughput for our customers. Our products have continuously advanced as we strive to meet our customers evolving needs. We have developed, and continue to develop, new products to address industry trends, such as the shrinking of integrated circuit critical dimensions and technology inflections, and, in the flat panel display and solar markets, the transition to larger substrate sizes, which require more advanced process control technology. In addition, we have developed, and continue to develop, products that support the migration to new classes of materials, ultra-thin layers, and 3D structures that are used in small geometry manufacturing. We involve our marketing, engineering, manufacturing and sales personnel in the development of new products in order to reduce the time to market for new products. Our employees also work closely with our customers development personnel, helping us to identify and define future technical needs on which to focus research and development efforts. We support research at academic institutions targeted at advances in materials science and semiconductor process development. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 663 research and development employees, primarily located in the United States, France and Israel. Our research and development expenses were $135.7 million, $132.6 million and $110.6 million for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our research and development efforts include numerous projects, none of which are individually material, and generally have a duration of 3 to 30 months depending upon whether the product is an enhancement of existing technology or a new product. Our current initiatives include projects to enhance the performance characteristics of older products, to develop new products and to integrate various technologies into subsystems. 
 Manufacturing 
 Our manufacturing facilities are located in Austria, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, Romania, the United Kingdom and the United States. Manufacturing activities include the assembly and testing of components and subassemblies, which are integrated into our products. We outsource some of our assembly work. We purchase a wide range of electronic, optical, mechanical and electrical components, some of which are designed to our specifications. We consider our lean manufacturing techniques and responsiveness to customers significantly fluctuating product demands to be a competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,109 manufacturing-related employees, located primarily in North America (United States) and Asia (primarily China and Israel). 
Backlog 
 At December 31, 2018, our backlog of unfilled orders for all products and services was $400 million, compared to $464 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in backlog of $64 million in 2018 compared to 
 
7 


  2017 is primarily attributed to a decrease in business levels throughout our company in the second half of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $391 million of our consolidated backlog was scheduled to be shipped on or before December 31, 2019. In general, we schedule production of our products based upon our customers delivery requirements. Our lead times are very short, as a large portion of our orders are received and shipped within 90 days. While backlog is calculated on the basis of firm orders, orders may be subject to cancellation or delay, in many cases, by the customer with limited or no penalty. Our backlog at any particular date, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of actual sales which may be generated for any succeeding period. Historically, our backlog levels have fluctuated based upon the ordering patterns of our customers and changes in our manufacturing capacity.
