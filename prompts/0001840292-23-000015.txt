Item 1. Business
Overview
Heliogen, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Heliogen,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a leader in next generation concentrated solar energy. We are developing a modular, AI-enabled, concentrated solar energy plant that will use an array of mirrors to reflect sunlight and capture, concentrate, store and convert it into cost-effective energy on demand. Our product offering will deliver industrial process steam around the clock using thermal energy storage based on proven technology. This steam can also be used to produce green hydrogen when coupled with a solid oxide electrolyzer. Our next generation system will have the ability to cost-effectively generate and store thermal energy at very high temperatures, which enables cost effective production of electricity and higher temperature industrial process heat. The inclusion of a thermal energy storage system distinguishes our solution from clean energy provided by typical photovoltaic (“PV”) and wind installations which do not produce thermal energy and are only able to produce energy intermittently unless battery storage is added. The system will be configurable for several applications, including carbon-free industrial-grade heat and steam (for use in industrial processes), clean power (electricity), and generation of green hydrogen, based on a customer’s needs.
We have developed innovations in the process of concentrating sunlight which we believe fundamentally improve the potential to efficiently and cost effectively collect and deliver energy to industrial processes. We believe we will be one of the first technology providers with the ability to deliver cost-effective renewable energy capable of replacing fossil fuels used in industrial processes that require high temperature heat and/or nearly 24/7 operation. In addition, we believe our disruptive, patented design and AI technology will address a fundamental problem confronted by many renewable sources of energy: intermittency. An intermittent power supply does not match the continuous power demand of industry and the grid. Without storage, wind and PV-based renewable energy generation may rapidly fluctuate between over-supply and under-supply based on resource availability. As the grid penetration of intermittent resources increases, these fluctuations may become increasingly extreme. We believe our technology will contribute to solving this problem. Our next generation solar plants will have the ability to store very high temperature energy in solid media. This energy will then be dispatchable, including during times without sunlight, to cost-effectively deliver near 24/7 carbon-free energy in the form of heat and steam, electric power, or green hydrogen fuel.
The three use categories will be configured as follows, forming the backbone of three business lines:
HelioHeat — The production of heat or steam for use in industrial processes will be enabled by the baseline system.
HelioPower — With the baseline system as the foundation, the addition of a turbine generator system will enable power generation.
HelioFuel — With the baseline system as the foundation, the addition of an electrolyzer system will enable hydrogen fuel production.
For the hydrogen and power systems, Heliogen is developing a supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle power block to enhance production efficiency. Using supercritical CO2 is predicted by the U.S. Department of Energy (the “DOE”) to have “significantly lower capital costs than equivalent steam-cycle components, due to their compact footprint stemming from the higher energy density of the supercritical fluid.”

Strategic Update
On February 5, 2023, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) appointed Christiana Obiaya, previously our Chief Financial Officer, as Chief Executive Officer and Kelly Rosser, our Chief Accounting Officer, as Interim Chief Financial Officer. We also announced a renewed strategic focus to capitalize on evolving customer demand, emerging market conditions and enhanced operational efficiency. The core pillars that will serve as the basis for our comprehensive plan include: 
•Sales. In response to emerging market conditions we intend to prioritize our sales efforts to focus on driving forward our industrial steam product. This product has the ability to provide zero-carbon energy in the form of steam for two critical applications: industrial processes and green hydrogen production when paired with a solid oxide electrolyzer. The industrial steam market provides us with a significant opportunity while the green hydrogen market is nascent but growing rapidly, turbocharged by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”).
•First installation of commercial-scale projects. We believe having data from completed projects will unlock demand from prospective customers for whom “operating commercial-scale project” is a must-have selection criterion. We need to convert “prospective” to “contracted” for those who are not early adopters of technology. We believe that getting projects in the ground will usher in a larger customer base, ultimately charting the path for companies who want to license our technology and build it themselves. 
•Reducing our cost structure. We intend to cut costs, streamline our operations and focus our efforts on driving tangible, immediate results, which could extend our liquidity runway. This aligns with our goal of funding our business with internally generated cash flows from operations. This would give us time to further develop projects, putting us in a more advantageous position to pursue a future capital raise. 
Products & Services 
Heliogen’s business focuses on the development and deployment of our innovative concentrated solar energy technology. The main components of our concentrated solar energy technology include heliostat fields and associated control systems, solar receivers, thermal energy storage and heat engines. A heliostat is a mirror affixed to a two-axis tracking mechanism which allows it to move in a trajectory that places its reflected beam of sunlight onto a desired point. A heliostat field is a large array of many heliostats, all operating in coordination to focus their reflected beams onto a common location atop a tower located near or within the field. The solar receiver is the device mounted at that focal point which absorbs the highly concentrated solar energy and converts it to thermal energy in a heat transfer medium. The heat transfer medium then carries that thermal energy to the thermal energy storage system, where a large mass of material is brought to very high temperatures inside an insulated enclosure, acting as a thermal battery. When energy is needed, the heat transfer medium transfers thermal energy from the thermal energy storage system and delivers it to the thermal process being powered or for use in generating electricity or hydrogen.
Because Heliogen’s technology is fundamentally a thermal energy source, we believe our products are particularly well-suited to meeting the thermal energy demand of industrial processes. As one example, many industrial facilities use steam to supply energy to their process. Heliogen’s technology, in the form of a HelioHeat plant, can supply this steam nearly 24/7 by collecting thermal energy while the sun is shining, storing it in the thermal energy storage system, and using that thermal energy to supply heat to a boiler when the industrial process needs steam. Our technological innovations will enable the delivery of our HelioHeat, HelioPower and HelioFuel solutions to customers. HelioHeat plants will produce carbon-free heat (e.g. process steam) to support industrial processes. HelioPower plants will deliver solar thermal energy to a heat engine to produce electrical power. HelioFuel plants will couple HelioHeat and HelioPower technology with an electrolyzer to produce green hydrogen fuel. All three solutions will be enabled by Heliogen’s proprietary heliostat design and AI technology, and will integrate thermal energy storage to enable operation nearly 24/7, overcoming the intermittency of other solar energy technologies.
Table of Contents

For each of the three above solutions, we are offering multiple support models to customers looking to deploy Heliogen’s technology:
•Contracting with owner-operators to build turnkey facilities that deploy Heliogen’s technology (Heliogen will contract with engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) partners for constructing the facility);
•Selling heliostats (and associated software control systems) to owner-operators and/or EPC contractors;
•Providing asset maintenance support services during operation, for completed facilities that use Heliogen’s technology and;
•Providing project development support services to help customers advance readiness to break ground in advance of final investment decisions.
In the future, we will also be prepared to offer Heliogen’s IP through a licensing model to third parties interested in manufacturing and installing the hardware.
Raw Materials
The most important raw materials required for our concentrated solar energy systems are steel (sheet, tube, bar, extrusions), stainless steel (pipe), glass (float glass), copper (wiring), aluminum (die castings, extrusions), commodity electrical & electronics components, ceramics & ceramic fibers, thermal insulation materials, bauxite particles and/or silica sand and concrete. Our components are produced by suppliers both domestically and internationally where most raw materials are readily available. Many major equipment and systems components are procured on a single or sole-source basis, but where multiple sources exist, we work to qualify multiple suppliers to minimize supply chain risk. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies with lengthy procurement lead times. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our IP and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.
Growth and Market Opportunity
Growth 
Heliogen’s growth is tied to the global phenomenon commonly described as “the energy transition” – that is, the shift in energy supply from burning fossil fuels to harnessing low-carbon and renewable sources of energy. Data linking the role of carbon emissions in accelerating climate change has led to shareholders and activists applying pressure to companies and governments to take action. This trend has been on the rise since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, led largely by Europe. As a result, the energy transition has become a major focus of both private and public sector leaders around the world. Companies and governments have begun setting ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and to use renewable resources to sustainably power their operations.
Heliogen’s growth strategy is to harness the significant demand by delivering technology that enables scalable, distributed, solar-thermal energy plants that can create heat, steam, power and “clean” hydrogen– i.e., without the carbon emissions produced by fossil fuel energy sources. Our solutions target the end markets with a need for heat, electric power and hydrogen. Such markets include the oil & gas, power, cement, steel and mining industries.
Heliogen’s technology platform allows modular plants for heat, steam, power and/or hydrogen to be built at customer locations. Our strategy to achieve scale is through modularity and repeatability, with minimal custom re-engineering compared to prior iterations of this technology. The majority of the plant will be built in a factory that can be scaled to produce many plants per year. Heliogen will be able to further scale by replicating that factory in multiple regions as the company expands globally.

Leveraging the modularity of the system and repeatability of its implementation, in the near to medium term, Heliogen will partner with contractors and other supply chain participants to execute projects. In the long term, we expect to license our core, patent-protected technology to owner-operators and EPC companies who can each deploy many plants, to achieve a scale and growth trajectory that can take advantage of the size of the market opportunity. Licensing could enable Heliogen to improve the pace of our deployments, as well as increase our profit margins, beyond what could be achieved solely through our direct implementation.
In order to support Heliogen’s growth as described above, we will continue our dedication to research and development (“R&D”) and to iterating on our novel combination and integration of hardware and software. We are working to harness our specialty of using software, automation, robotics and algorithms to reduce the quantity of materials, the amount of human labor and the duration of time required to deliver our projects at scale.
Geographically we are focused initially on the U.S., but we plan to position Heliogen to respond to global demand in locations with strong solar resources such as Mexico, South America, Australia, Africa and parts of Europe in the future. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, global energy demand is expected to increase nearly 50% over the next 30 years, due to an increase in population and the economic growth of developing countries. We expect that demand for carbon-free replacements for current energy sources will further increase the demand for Heliogen’s products.
Renewables Growth 
Governments, corporations and investors are making concerted efforts and setting aggressive targets to reduce GHG emissions and phase out fossil fuel use. Such initiatives include setting timelines for zero-emission targets, establishing caps on CO2 emissions and instituting certain other environmental sustainability initiatives. For example, in the U.S., the Biden Administration has declared the following key environmental targets: (i) a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035, (ii) a net-zero (i.e., carbon reduction is equal to or greater than carbon emissions) economy by 2050 and (iii) to achieve in 2030 a 50-52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG pollution. In the private sector, companies have also committed to environmental sustainability initiatives. Leading financial and corporate institutions have requested that all boards of directors prepare and disclose a plan to be compatible with a net-zero economy and to commit to launching investment products aligned to a net-zero pathway. Individually and collectively, these initiatives support the increased demand for renewable fuels, transportation, energy storage, renewable power, low-carbon process heat and energy efficiency.
The key driver for renewable energy generation and storage will be increased reliance on intermittent renewable energy resources like solar PV and wind. As penetration of these renewable sources increases, the intermittency of these resources can put strain on the grid if the operator is unable to fully match supply with demand. This strain can lead to an inability to supply power when it is needed and increased costs to consumers.
Energy storage can help reduce this strain. However, beyond a threshold level of renewable penetration, current solutions to energy storage, such as batteries, are insufficient to ensure grid reliability. Research from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a national laboratory of the DOE, suggests that this threshold may be around 30% renewable penetration based on its Eastern Renewable Generation Integration Study; which found that the Eastern Interconnection, one of the largest power systems in the world, can accommodate upwards of 30% of wind and solar PV power. In order to maintain system stability and achieve mandated decarbonization goals, longer duration energy storage options must be deployed. We believe Heliogen’s technology will be among a small list of available technologies that will be able to respond to this energy storage need in order to maintain grid reliability.

Woodside Energy (USA) Inc.
In March 2022, we entered into a series of commercial agreements with Woodside Energy (USA) Inc. (“Woodside”) for the commercial-scale demonstration and deployment of our AI-enabled concentrated solar energy technology. We also entered into a collaboration agreement with Woodside to jointly market our technology in Australia (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with the objective to deploy further commercial-scale modules of our HelioHeat, HelioPower and HelioFuel offerings. Under this arrangement, the parties expect to define product offerings that use Heliogen’s modular technology for potential customers (including Woodside) in Australia and are establishing a roadmap to identify and engage with those customers. 
Competition
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, strong competition from a number of alternative providers of energy technology, particularly as the economy increasingly shifts towards low-emission, zero-emission or carbon neutral solutions. As a result, we expect competition to intensify in the future as existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products into our markets.
The traditional energy technology provider market is highly competitive. The declining cost of renewable energy is also contributing to the shift in customer demand as customers seek carbon-free solutions to replace their fossil fuel-based consumption, causing the industry to evolve and expand. The main competitive factors include, but are not limited to:
•Upfront and ongoing cost;
•Safety and reliability;
•Duration;
•Performance and uptime;
•Operational flexibility;
•Asset life length and cyclability;
•Ease of integration;
•Operability in extreme weather conditions;
•Environmental sustainability;
•Historical track record; and
•Field-proven technology.
With the rising demand for clean energy solutions with lower GHG emissions, there has been a transition to renewable energy sources. This industry transformation has created an opportunity for an increased role for thermal energy and long-duration energy storage solutions like what Heliogen will provide. As a pioneer of solar energy technology solutions that are well-suited for long duration applications, we believe we have a significant edge over our competition in this rapidly evolving environment. Our competitors include traditional fossil-fueled alternatives; providers of solutions combining solar PV with battery storage; and other forms of renewable energy. Our competitors may have longer operating histories and greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do and could focus their substantial financial resources to develop a competitive advantage. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources. Although we are small and at an earlier stage of commercial maturity compared to many of our competitors, we believe we are well-positioned to compete successfully in the market — based on our innovative closed loop tracking system, our HelioHeat, HelioPower and HelioFuel solutions, our strategic partnerships and our premier leadership team with a proven track record of success across the energy industry and other industries.

New technologies may enter the market that may have additional or superior advantages to our future offerings. A variety of newer and emerging companies have announced plans to develop heat, power, hydrogen and energy storage products using a variety of technologies, including compressed air, thermal energy and solid-state batteries among others. Although many of these companies are not in commercial production today, they may in the future offer solutions that become competitive with our expected offerings. We intend to continuously improve our product offerings and maintain robust R&D efforts in order to stay ahead of existing and emerging competitors.
Competitive Strengths and Differentiation
As a result of factors described below, we believe that we are positioned to become a market leader in renewable energy technology.
•Significant Head Start with Proprietary Technology and Ongoing Research & Development. We believe we have a first-mover advantage over other industry competitors as we have been committed since our founding in 2013 to the development of solar energy solutions that enable decarbonization of our economy. This is evidenced by our rich portfolio of IP. We have demonstrated capability to concentrate sunlight to produce heat at temperatures ranging from 150 to 1,000 degrees centigrade, made possible by our first-of-a-kind ability to achieve high mirror adjustment accuracy. We have patented the most valuable parts of our technology at each stage of development. Beyond the patents, our journey as a company and the bench of experience across our leadership team has provided and continues to provide invaluable learnings and technical know-how that we believe will be difficult to rival. We continue to develop and maintain our knowledge base, which we believe provides us with a substantial strategic head start and competitive advantage against competition in the concentrated solar energy and energy storage spaces. We also continue to target incremental and transformational improvements across all aspects of our technology in order to reduce costs and improve performance.
•High-Temperature Thermal Energy Enabled by Closed-Loop Tracking System. Fundamental to Heliogen’s offering is our proprietary heliostat design and AI technology. We use proprietary advanced computer vision software technology — a form of AI — to identify and precisely align an array of mirrors to reflect sunlight to a target on the top of a tower, creating high-temperature, carbon-free thermal energy. Our tracking system makes automatic micro-adjustments of the mirrors over the course of the day to account for the movement of the sun in the sky. These automatic adjustments, using a unique closed-loop feedback system, maximize solar concentration and energy capture, resulting in higher temperature heat than what has previously been provided by other approaches to concentrated solar energy technology. This opens up new opportunities to provide industrial process heat across a greater range of temperatures, as well as flexibility for a broader duration range of thermal energy storage. This system also enables the elimination of the expensive slew drive gearbox used in similar applications, eliminates time consuming and costly calibration processes, as well as a host of other benefits.

•Near Always-Available Renewable Energy. At current renewables penetration across the U.S. energy market, most of the energy storage solutions on the market provide two to four-hour energy storage. Without efficient and scalable energy storage that can exceed such two to four-hour energy storage timeframes, renewable energy generation cannot meet continuous power demands of industrial customers and the grid. The peak demand curve is essentially the opposite of the solar peak curve, which leads to curtailment during the middle of the day. Heliogen expects to be able to generate, store and provide renewable energy to match the existing demand curve. Our near-term industrial process steam solution uses a steam accumulator, which is proven technology, to store steam for delivery after the sun sets. In addition, by integrating higher temperature solid media thermal storage, we believe our next generation system will be able to provide near constant energy throughout the day to produce electrical power or green hydrogen with an electrolyzer. Heliogen’s technology is designed to store the energy generated from concentrating the sun’s rays into solid media — such as rocks, sand or ceramic material — in the form of heat. This type of storage is expected to be a lower cost form of storage compared to what other solar energy companies use, and it will be made possible by the high temperatures enabled by Heliogen’s technology. Heliogen will store that energy, and then when it is needed, use a heat exchanger to bring that energy either to an engine, an industrial facility, or to an electrolyzer to make green hydrogen.
•Modular and Scalable Plant Design. Heliogen’s modular and scalable plant design accommodates growth to compete with large scale renewable projects. Depending on application, our modules can be sized to as small as a few hundred kilowatts for thermal applications. For large projects, our modules can be sized to tens of megawatts and can additionally be installed in multiples. As an example of modularity, one of Heliogen’s 5 MW modules can be replicated to meet larger customer demands to supply electricity for the production of hydrogen. Depending on location, we expect to design each 5 MW module to high-capacity factor renewable power, with a future target of achieving less than 5 cents per kW-hour power cost, which would have the ability to ultimately generate over 850,000 kilograms of hydrogen year. The plant’s small footprint allows it to be sited alongside energy-hungry industrial facilities rather than in remote deserts.
This modular system is also designed to utilize mirrors (heliostats) smaller than traditional concentrated solar energy mirrors, enabling our heliostats to be manufactured at scale in a repeatable process. By building modularly and shifting more assembly work from the construction field into the controlled conditions of a manufacturing facility, we expect to be able to scale more quickly and efficiently, while reducing overall costs compared to alternative approaches.
•Competitive Forecast Economics. Historically, concentrated solar energy companies have struggled to compete with PV solar due to high costs. However, while the cost of PV solar has decreased dramatically in the last decade, the issue of intermittency remains unresolved. In addition, PV does not offer an efficient solution for generating heat. As a result, PV solar may be uneconomical for many industrial processes that require heat and/or reliable delivery.
We believe our projected economics will be competitive with other prevalent sources of clean energy that include storage. For example, on a forward-looking basis, our future targets estimate a cost of less than 5 cents per MWh for power and less than $2.00 per kilogram of hydrogen, which is competitive with alternative sources. This analysis assumes subsidized economics with 60% debt at an 8% interest rate and 40% equity at a 12% cost over a 30-year projection period. Additionally, these projections are based on expected cost reductions associated with manufacturing production efficiencies, module-enabled economies of scale and mechanical improvements such as elimination of an expensive slew-drive gearbox that is enabled by the closed-loop tracking system.
•International Expansion. After our initial projects, we forecast international expansion, focusing on capital efficiency enabled by our proprietary applications and agile heliostat manufacturing approach. We are in various stages of discussions with numerous companies in Australia, Chile, Mexico and elsewhere. We also intend to leverage our strategic and commercial relationships with international footprints to cross-sell to foreign markets.

•Highly Experienced Management Team. We have built a world-class team composed of industry leaders with decades of experience from some of the most well-known and highly regarded companies in the energy, solar, technology, manufacturing and construction industries. Our committed, entrepreneurial team has decades of industry leading technical, operational, development and commercial experience which has positioned us to disrupt the current energy industry paradigms.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to protect our material IP is important to our business. We rely upon a combination of foreign, federal, state and common law protections afforded to owners of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks, along with employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions to establish and protect our IP rights. In particular, unpatented trade secrets in the fields of research, development and engineering are an important aspect of our business by ensuring that our technology remains confidential. We also pursue patent protection when we believe we have developed a patentable invention and the benefits of obtaining a patent outweigh the risks of making the invention public through patent filings. 
We hold a strong portfolio of patents and numerous trademarks covering key aspects of our plant and process, including our closed-loop tracking system, tracking based on radiance maps, intensity and polarization tracking, and receiver for capturing solar energy. As of December 31, 2022, we had a portfolio of 8 issued U.S. patents, 6 issued non-U.S. patents, 22 patent applications pending for examination in the U.S. and 14 patent applications pending for examination in other countries as well as numerous trademarks. However, our portfolio of patents is expected to evolve as new patents are issued, older patents expire, and we continue to innovate. Our U.S. issued patents are expected to expire between 2029 and 2040. We regularly review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new inventions, and we are prepared to file additional patent applications when we determine it would benefit our business to do so.
Government, Programs, Incentives and Regulations
We operate in the heavily regulated energy sector, which is subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations and agencies that impact our operations. As a participant in the renewable energy sector specifically, there are additional regulations, tax incentives and support mechanisms in place to promote growth.
On the U.S. federal level, tax credits are currently in place that incentivize the deployment of renewable energy. Projects generating renewable energy are eligible for investment tax credits that, with proper structuring, lower the capital requirements for renewables projects to be developed and open a new source of funding for these projects. The value of the tax credit varies depending on the year in which construction is deemed to begin. Under the current legislative framework, solar projects starting construction in 2023 qualify for a tax credit equal to 22% of the project’s cost. The value of the credit drops to a permanent 10% level for projects that begin construction in 2024 or later. Projects that begin construction before 2024 but are not placed in service until 2026 or later, are also limited to the 10% credit.
The possibility of additional federal incentives and investment from the Biden Administration and Congress has garnered enthusiasm among renewable energy developers. The administration has announced goals of decarbonizing the electricity sector entirely by 2035, a goal that would necessitate billions of dollars in additional investment. Some of this money is likely to be invested in solar, hydrogen and storage technologies, potentially a benefit for a company like Heliogen. For example, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $9.5 billion in funding for clean hydrogen, some of which will be applicable to companies which develop and install technology for clean hydrogen production. 
In addition, in early 2022, the DOE announced funding for innovative R&D projects to accelerate the large-scale development of solar technologies that can deliver high-temperature solar heat on demand due to integration with a thermal energy storage system. 
Table of Contents

State-level incentives have also driven growth in the deployment of renewable energy. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, currently 31 states, Washington, D.C. and two territories have active renewable or clean energy requirements, which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered to customers come from eligible renewal energy resources while an additional three states and one territory have set voluntary renewable energy goals. For example, California’s renewable portfolio standards require that 60% of the state’s electricity must come from renewable sources by 2030 and 100% by 2045. States have created these standards to diversify their energy resources, promote domestic energy production and encourage economic development. Historically, unfavorable utility rate structures have been a barrier to increased deployment of renewable energy technologies. However, some states have recently mandated that a certain portion of that eligible renewable energy must be distributed generation. 
The IRA was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA contains many provisions intended to incentivize domestic clean energy investment, clean energy production and manufacturing of necessary components, specifically: (a) the extension and enhancement of the Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) program, which the IRA extends to thermal energy storage equipment; (b) the addition of Production Tax Credits (“PTC”) up to $3.00 per kilogram for clean hydrogen and a three-year extension and modification of PTCs for facilities that begin construction before December 31, 2024; (c) the creation of the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit that applies to the solar components we plan to manufacture at our facility in Long Beach, California; (d) the creation of a new tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel up to $1.75 per gallon, depending on the lifecycle carbon emissions reduction of the fuel; and (e) the increase in total funds available for the DOE’s Title 17 loan guarantee program by $3.6 billion, bringing the total to $40 billion. The ITC and PTC amount can be increased if certain domestic content requirements are satisfied or if a project is located in (i) an “energy community” or (ii) low-income community, each as defined in the IRA. Heliogen is continuing to evaluate the IRA to understand the full impact of these provisions and additional potential benefits and believes many of these provisions will drive increased demand for its renewable energy technology and related products.
Other Public Policy Considerations
Different public policy mechanisms have been used by governments to accelerate the adoption and use of solar power and energy storage. Examples of customer-focused financial mechanisms include capital cost rebates, performance-based incentives, feed-in tariffs, tax credits and net energy metering. Some of these government mandates and economic incentives are scheduled to be reduced or to expire, or could be eliminated altogether, while others are scheduled to be extended or expanded. Capital cost rebates provide funds to customers based on the cost and size of a customer’s solar power or energy storage system. Performance-based incentives provide funding to a customer based on the energy produced by their solar power system or stored by their energy storage system. Feed-in tariffs pay customers for solar power system generation based on energy produced, at a rate generally guaranteed for a period of time. Tax credits reduce a customer’s taxes at the time the taxes are due. Net energy metering allows customers to deliver to the electric grid any excess electricity produced by their on-site solar power systems, and to be credited for that excess electricity at or near the full retail price of electricity. New market development mechanisms to encourage the use of renewable energy sources continue to emerge.
For more information about how we avail ourselves of the benefits of public policies and the risks related to public policies, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Environmental and Other Regulations
We are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws and regulations to which we are subject govern, among others, vehicle emissions and the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations.
Table of Contents

Environmental standards applicable to us are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses issued to us. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and what we anticipate will be increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial administrative, civil or even criminal fines, penalties and possibly orders to cease any violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits or licenses.
We use, generate and discharge toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes in our R&D and construction activities. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the purchase, storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. We believe that we have all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business and expect to obtain all necessary environmental permits for future activities. We believe that we have properly handled our hazardous materials and wastes and have appropriately remediated any contamination at any of our premises. We are currently not subject to any litigation pertaining to environmental regulations and cost of compliance with applicable regulations is expected to be commensurate with our historical spend and other companies in the industry.
In addition to our existing environmental compliance initiatives, we will also be engaging additional resources to focus on a broader Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) program across our business. As part of our commitment to energy sustainability, we completed an ESG assessment during 2022 to develop a baseline against which to prioritize its ESG strategies.
Finally, we are subject to federal, state and local requirements on health, safety and employment. We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, local wage regulations and rigorous health and safety regulations in the State of California.
Human Capital
We take pride in our innovative technology and consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and continued success. More than 80% of our employees have extensive experience or backgrounds in engineering, energy, or manufacturing. More than half of our employees are involved in product development and manufacturing. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 220 full-time employees, based primarily in Southern California.
Our high-performance culture is based on our commitment to results and our values, which we expect everyone to model in their daily conduct: 
•We are improving the world. We will deliver affordable renewable energy, more economically than fossil fuels, benefiting the entire global community.
•We are bold. We are bold, persistent and challenge the status quo in order to achieve technological breakthroughs and a profitable business.
•We treat everyone respectfully. We are respectful, transparent and collaborative. We maintain a safe environment for the well-being and inclusion of everyone.
•We value diversity. We value and pursue diversity in all its forms, and welcome ideas and input from everyone.
•We welcome feedback. We are committed to feedback, continuous improvement and learning, so everyone can contribute their best work with passion and enjoyment.
We believe that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent, produce more creative solutions and innovative products and services, and foster a work culture that reflects our core values. We have established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion program, with the goal of developing a multi-year action plan to improve the diversity of our team and ensure every employee feels included and valued.

Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, we have elected not use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards, and as such, we are required to adopt new or revised standards at the same time as other public companies. 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of our fiscal year (a) following March 19, 2026, the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering; (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion; or (c) in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer”, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, or (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
