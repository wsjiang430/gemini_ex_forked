Item 1.    Business.
General
We are engaged primarily in two business segments: movie theatres and hotels and resorts.
As of December 29, 2022, our theatre operations included 85 movie theatres with 1,064 screens throughout 17 states (Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia). We also operate a family entertainment center, Funset Boulevard, that is adjacent to one of our theatres in Appleton, Wisconsin. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are the 4th largest theatre circuit in the United States.
As of December 29, 2022, our hotels and resorts operations included seven wholly-owned and operated hotels and resorts in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Nebraska. We also manage nine hotels, resorts and other properties for third parties in Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, Nevada, Nebraska, Illinois, Iowa, and Pennsylvania. As of December 29, 2022, we owned or managed approximately 4,900 hotel and resort rooms.
Both of these business segments are discussed in detail below. For information regarding the revenues, operating income or loss, assets and certain other financial information of these segments for the last three full fiscal years, please see our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Note 14 in Part II below.
Strategic Plans
Please see our discussion under “Current Plans” in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Theatre Operations
At the end of fiscal 2022, we owned or operated 85 movie theatre locations with a total of 1,064 screens in Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. We averaged 12.5 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 and 12.3 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2020. Our 85 company-owned facilities include 50 megaplex theatres (12 or more screens), representing approximately 70% of our total screens, 34 multiplex theatres (two to 11 screens) and one single-screen theatre.
We invested approximately $391 million, excluding acquisitions, to further enhance the movie-going experience and amenities in new and existing theatres over the last nine-plus years. These investments include:
New theatres. In October 2019, we opened the eight-screen Movie Tavern® by Marcus theatre in Brookfield, Wisconsin. This theatre became the first Movie Tavern by Marcus in Wisconsin. It includes eight auditoriums, each with laser projection and comfortable DreamLoungerSM recliner seating, a full-service bar and food and drink center, and a new delivery-to-seat service model that also allows guests to order food and beverage via our mobile phone application or in-theatre kiosk. We will consider additional sites for potential new theatre locations in both new and existing markets in the future. 
Theatre acquisitions. In addition to building new theatres, acquisitions of existing theatres or theatre circuits has also been a viable growth strategy for us. In 2019, we acquired the assets of Movie Tavern®, a New Orleans-based industry leading circuit known for its in-theatre dining concept featuring chef-driven menus, premium quality food and drink and luxury seating. Now branded Movie Tavern by Marcus, the acquired circuit consisted of 208 screens at 22 locations in nine states – Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. The purchase price consisted of $30 million in cash and 2,450,000 shares of our common stock, for a total purchase price of approximately $139.3 million. The acquisition of the Movie Tavern circuit increased our total number of screens at that time by an additional 23%.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the theatre exhibition industry. Following the pandemic, theatre operators continue to face on-going challenges including supply chain disruptions impacting movie production and a post-production backlog that has resulted in delays of movie releases and a reduced number of films available for theatrical release. A number of theatre operators have filed for bankruptcy relief and many others continue to face difficult financial circumstances. Although we will prioritize our own finances, we will continue to consider potential acquisitions as well as consider management agreements which may possibly lead to opportunities to own. The movie theatre industry is very fragmented, with approximately 50% of United States screens owned by the three largest theatre circuits and the other 50% owned by an estimated 800 smaller operators, making it very difficult to predict when acquisition opportunities may arise. We do not believe that we are geographically constrained, and we believe that we may be able to add value to certain theatres through our various proprietary amenities and operating expertise.
DreamLounger recliner additions. These luxurious, state-of-the-art recliners allow guests to go from upright to a full-recline position in seconds. These seat changes require full auditorium remodels to accommodate the necessary 84 inches of legroom, resulting in the loss of approximately 50% of the existing traditional seats in an average auditorium. To date, the addition of DreamLoungers has increased attendance at each of our applicable theatres, outperforming nearby competitive theatres and growing the overall market attendance in most cases. From fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021, we added DreamLounger seating at eight acquired Movie Tavern or Marcus Wehrenberg theatres and one newly built Movie Tavern by Marcus theatre. As of December 29, 2022, we offered all DreamLounger recliner seating in 66 theatres, representing approximately 78% of our theatres. Including our premium, large format (PLF) auditoriums with recliner seating, as of December 29, 2022, we offered our DreamLounger recliner seating in approximately 81% of our screens, a percentage we believe to be the highest among the largest theatre chains in the nation.
UltraScreen DLX® and SuperScreen DLX® (DreamLounger eXperience) conversions. We introduced one of the first PLF presentations to the industry when we rolled out our proprietary UltraScreen® concept over 20 years ago. We later introduced our UltraScreen DLX concept by combining our premium, large-format presentation with DreamLounger recliner seating and Dolby® Atmos™ immersive sound to elevate the movie-going experience for our guests. Most of our PLF screens now include the added feature of heated DreamLounger recliner seats. From fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2022, we converted one existing screen at an acquired theatre to UltraScreen DLX, opened one new UltraScreen DLX at an acquired theatre, converted 35 existing screens at acquired theatres to SuperScreen DLX, and opened one new SuperScreen DLX auditorium at a newly built Movie Tavern by Marcus theatre. As of December 29, 2022, we had 31 UltraScreen DLX auditoriums, one traditional UltraScreen auditorium, 89 SuperScreen DLX auditoriums (a slightly smaller screen than an UltraScreen but with the same DreamLounger seating and Dolby Atmos sound) and three IMAX® PLF screens at 66 of our theatre locations. As of December 29, 2022, we offered at least one PLF screen in approximately 78% of our theatres – once again a percentage we believe to be the highest percentage among the largest theatre chains in the nation. Our PLF screens generally have higher per-screen revenues and draw customers from a larger geographic region compared to our standard screens, and we charge a premium price to our guests for this experience. During fiscal 2022, we converted four existing screens to SuperScreen DLX, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to convert additional existing screens to SuperScreen DLX auditoriums.
Signature cocktail and dining concepts. We have continued to further enhance our food and beverage offerings within our existing theatres. We believe our 50-plus years of food and beverage experience in the hotel and restaurant businesses provides us with a unique advantage and expertise that we can leverage to further grow revenues in our theatres. The concepts we are expanding include:
•Take Five® Lounge, Take Five Express and The Tavern – These full-service bars offer an inviting atmosphere and a chef-inspired dining menu, along with a complete selection of cocktails, locally-brewed beers and wines. We also offer full liquor service through the concession stand at two theatres. We acquired 22 new bars, known as The Tavern, in conjunction with our Movie Tavern acquisition and opened an additional Tavern at our Brookfield, Wisconsin Movie Tavern by Marcus theatre in fiscal 2019. We closed three Movie Tavern by Marcus theatres in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021. We added one Take Five Lounge outlet in fiscal 2021 to a Marcus Wehrenberg theatre that underwent a complete renovation. As of December 29, 2022, we offered bars/full liquor service at 49 theatres, representing approximately 58% of our theatres. We are currently evaluating opportunities to add bar service to additional locations.
•Zaffiro’s® Express – These outlets offer lobby dining that includes appetizers, sandwiches, salads, desserts and our signature Zaffiro’s THINCREDIBLE® handmade thin-crust pizza. In select locations without a Take Five Lounge outlet, we offer beer and wine at the Zaffiro’s Express outlet. We opened one new Zaffiro’s Express outlet during fiscal 2019 at our Movie Tavern by Marcus location in Brookfield, Wisconsin, and our number of theatres with this concept totaled 29 as of December 29, 2022, representing approximately 45% of our theatres (excluding our in-theatre dining Movie Tavern theatres). We also operate three Zaffiro’s® Pizzeria and Bar full-service restaurants.
•Reel Sizzle® – This signature dining concept serves menu items inspired by classic Hollywood and the iconic diners of the 1950s. We offer Americana fare like burgers and chicken sandwiches prepared on a griddle behind the counter, along with chicken tenders, crinkle-cut fries, ice cream and signature shakes. Our Movie Tavern by Marcus in Brookfield, Wisconsin includes a Real Sizzle. We added one Reel Sizzle outlet in fiscal 2021 to a Marcus Wehrenberg theatre that underwent a complete renovation. As of December 29, 2022, we operated nine Reel Sizzle outlets.
•Other in-lobby dining – We also operate one Hollywood Café at an existing theatre, and three of the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres offer in-lobby dining concepts sold through the concession stand. Including these additional concepts, as of December 29, 2022, we offered one or more in-lobby dining concepts in 39 theatres, representing approximately 60% of our theatres (excluding our in-theatre dining Movie Tavern theatres).
•In-theatre dining – As of December 29, 2022, we offered in-theatre dining with a complete menu of drinks and chef-prepared salads, sandwiches, entrées and desserts at 29 theatres and a total of 229 auditoriums, operating under the names Big Screen BistroSM, Big Screen Bistro ExpressSM, BistroPlex® and Movie Tavern by Marcus, representing approximately 34% of our theatres.
We offer a “Value Tuesday” promotion at every theatre in our circuit that includes discounted admission, concessions, food and non-alcoholic beverage to our loyalty program members. We have seen our Tuesday attendance increase dramatically since the introduction of the Tuesday promotion. We believe this promotion has increased movie-going frequency and reached a customer who may have stopped going to the movies because of price. We introduced our Tuesday promotions for loyalty members at our Marcus Wehrenberg theatres immediately upon acquisition in December 2016 and did the same thing in February 2019 with our acquired Movie Tavern theatres. We experienced an increase in Tuesday performance at the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres and Movie Tavern theatres after adding this promotion. We also offer a “Student Thursday” promotion at all of our locations that has been well received by that particular customer segment. In addition, we offer a “Young-at-Heart” program for seniors on Friday afternoons that was also introduced to our Movie Tavern locations during our fiscal 2019 first quarter.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced Marcus Private Cinema (“MPC”) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Under this program, a guest may purchase an entire auditorium for a fixed charge, ranging from $99 to $275 (depending upon the film and number of weeks it has been in theatres). Early on, sales attributable to our MPC program exceeded expectations, offsetting reduced traditional attendance at that time. As new film content became available and as vaccines were rolled out and theatre comfort level improved, the demand for these dedicated shows has slowed. At its peak during the majority of the weeks during our fiscal 2021 first quarter, we averaged over 1,500 MPC events per week, accounting for approximately 21% of our admission revenues during those weeks. While we have continued to offer the MPC program as a strategy to supplement non-peak business periods, as the pandemic has subsided it is no longer significant to our admission revenues.
We offer what we believe to be a best-in-class customer loyalty program called Magical Movie RewardsSM. We currently have approximately 5.1 million members enrolled in the program. Approximately 45% of all box office transactions and 40% of total transactions in our theatres during fiscal 2022 were completed by registered members of the loyalty program. The program allows members to earn points for each dollar spent and access special offers available only to members. The rewards are redeemable at the box office, concession stand or at the many Marcus Theatres® food and beverage venues. In addition, we have partnered with Movio, a global leader in data analysis for the cinema industry, to allow more targeted communication with our loyalty members. The software provides us with insight into customer preferences, attendance habits and general demographics, which we believe will help us deliver customized communication to our members. In turn, members of this program can enjoy and plan for a more personalized movie-going experience. The program also gives us the ability to cost effectively promote non-traditional programming and special events, particularly during non-peak time periods. We believe that this will result in increased movie-going frequency, more frequent visits to the concession stand, increased loyalty to Marcus Theatres and ultimately, improved operating results.
We continue to enhance our mobile ticketing capabilities, our downloadable Marcus Theatres mobile application, and our marcustheatres.com website. We added food and beverage ordering capabilities to our mobile application at all of our theatres in fiscal 2020. We have continued to install additional theatre-level technology, such as new ticketing kiosks, digital menu boards and concession advertising monitors. Each of these enhancements is designed to improve customer interactions, both at the theatre and through mobile platforms and other electronic devices.
The addition of digital technology throughout our circuit (we offer digital cinema projection on 100% of our screens) has provided us with additional opportunities to obtain non-motion picture alternative content programming from other new and existing content providers, including live and pre-recorded performances of the Metropolitan Opera, as well as sports, concerts and other events, at many of our locations. We offer weekday and weekend alternative content programming at many of our theatres across our circuit. This special programming includes classic movies, live performances, comedy shows and children’s performances. We believe this type of programming is more impactful when presented on the big screen and provides an opportunity to continue to expand our audience base beyond traditional moviegoers.
Revenues for the theatre business, and the motion picture industry in general, are heavily dependent on the general audience appeal of available films, together with studio marketing, advertising and support campaigns, factors over which we have no control. Blockbusters have historically accounted for a significant portion of our total admission revenues – in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, our top 15 performing films accounted for 48% of our fiscal 2019 total admission revenues and 42% of our fiscal 2018 total admission revenues. With fewer films released in recent years due to the pandemic, our top 15 films accounted for 55% and 63% of our fiscal 2021 and 2022 total admission revenues, respectively.
We obtain our films from several national motion picture production and distribution companies, and we are not dependent on any single motion picture supplier. Our booking, advertising, concession purchases and promotional activities are handled centrally by our administrative staff.
We strive to provide our movie patrons with high-quality picture and sound presentation in clean, comfortable, safe, attractive and contemporary theatre environments. All of our movie theatre complexes feature digital cinema technology; either digital sound, Dolby Atmos or other stereo sound systems; acoustical ceilings; side wall insulation; engineered drapery folds to eliminate sound imbalance, reverberation and distortion; tiled floors; cup-holder chair-arms; and computer-controlled heating, air conditioning and ventilation. We offer stadium seating, a tiered seating system that permits unobstructed viewing, at substantially all of our screens. Computerized box offices permit all of our movie theatres to sell tickets in advance and all of our theatres offer reserved seating. Our theatres are accessible to persons with disabilities and provide wireless headphones for hearing-impaired moviegoers. Other amenities at certain theatres include touch-screen, computerized, self-service ticket kiosks, which simplify advance ticket purchases. We have an agreement to allow moviegoers to buy tickets on Fandango, the largest online ticket-seller, or directly through our website or app.
Our goals from digital cinema included delivering an improved film presentation to our guests, increasing scheduling flexibility, providing a platform for additional 3D presentations as needed, as well as maximizing the opportunities for alternate programming that may be available with this technology. As of December 29, 2022, we had the ability to offer digital 3D presentations in 360, or approximately 34%, of our screens, including the vast majority of our UltraScreens. We have the ability to increase the number of digital 3D capable screens we offer to our guests in the future as needed, based on the number of digital 3D films anticipated to be released during future periods and our customers’ response to these 3D releases.
We sell food and beverage concessions in all of our movie theatres. We believe that a wide variety of food and beverage items, properly merchandised, increases concession revenue per patron. Although popcorn and soda remain the traditional favorites with moviegoers, we continue to upgrade our available concessions by offering varied choices. For example, some of our theatres offer hot dogs, pizza, ice cream, pretzel bites, frozen yogurt, coffee, mineral water and juices. We have also added self-serve soft drink dispensers and grab-and-go candy, frozen treat and bottled drink kiosks to many of our theatres. In recent years, we have added signature cocktail and dining concepts as described above. The response to our new food and beverage offerings has been very positive, and we have plans to continue to expand these food and beverage concepts at additional locations in the future.
We have a variety of ancillary revenue sources in our theatres, with the largest related to the sale of pre-show and lobby advertising (through our current advertising providers, Screenvision and National CineMedia). We also obtain ancillary revenues from corporate and group meeting sales, sponsorships, internet surcharge fees and alternate auditorium uses. We continue to pursue additional strategies to increase our ancillary revenue sources, including the addition of a post transaction click-through advertising agreement with Rokt during fiscal 2021.
We also own a family entertainment center, Funset Boulevard, adjacent to our 14-screen movie theatre in Appleton, Wisconsin. Funset Boulevard features a 40,000 square foot Hollywood-themed indoor amusement facility that includes a restaurant, party room, laser tag center, virtual reality games, arcade, outdoor miniature golf course and batting cages.

We own two SafeHouse restaurants in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Chicago, Illinois. SafeHouse is an iconic, spy-themed restaurant and bar that has operated in Milwaukee for over 56 years and has been owned by us for approximately seven years. The SafeHouse in Chicago, Illinois was opened in 2017.
Our Wisconsin Hospitality Linen Service (WHLS) business unit provides commercial laundry services for our hotel and resort properties in Wisconsin and for other unaffiliated hotels in the Midwest. WHLS processed nearly 16 million pounds of linen each year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and over 14 million pounds of linen in 2022. WHLS has been a leader in commercial laundry services for the hospitality industry in the Midwest for over 25 years.
We operate many award-winning restaurants and lounges within our hotel portfolio that have earned distinctions such as the TripAdvisor® Travelers’ Choice and the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence.
Competition
Both of our businesses experience intense competition from national, regional and local chain and franchise operations, some of which have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Most of our facilities are located in close proximity to competing facilities.
Our movie theatres compete with large national movie theatre operators, such as AMC Entertainment, Cinemark and Regal Cinemas, as well as with a wide array of smaller first-run exhibitors. Movie exhibitors also face competition from a number of other movie exhibition delivery systems, such as streaming services, premium video-on-demand (PVOD), digital downloads, video-on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs and network and syndicated television. We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the public’s leisure time and disposable income including, but not limited to, sporting events, live performance arts, and concerts.
Our hotels and resorts compete with the hotels and resorts operated and/or franchised by Hyatt Corporation, Marriott Corporation, Hilton Worldwide and others, along with other regional and local hotels and resorts. Increasingly, we also face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry, such as peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms, such as Airbnb, Vrbo and HomeAway. We compete for hotel management agreements with a wide variety of national, regional and local management companies based upon many factors, including the value and quality of our management services, our reputation, our ability and willingness to invest our capital in joint venture projects, the level of our management fees and our relationships with property owners and investors.
We believe that the principal factors of competition in both of our businesses, in varying degrees, are the price and quality of the product, quality and location of our facilities and customer service. We believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of these factors.
Seasonality
Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our first fiscal quarter typically produces the weakest operating results in our hotels and resorts division due primarily to the effects of reduced travel during the winter months. Our second and third fiscal quarters often produce our strongest operating results because these periods coincide with the typical summer seasonality of the movie theatre industry and the summer strength of the lodging business. Due to the fact that the week between Christmas and New Year’s Eve is historically one of the strongest weeks of the year for our theatre division, the specific timing of the last Thursday in December has an impact on the results of our fiscal first and fourth quarters in that division, particularly when we have a 53-week year.
Environmental Regulation
Federal, state and local environmental legislation has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, our activities in acquiring and selling real estate for business development purposes have been complicated by the continued emphasis that our personnel must place on properly analyzing real estate sites for potential environmental problems. This circumstance has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, greater time and increased costs involved in acquiring and selling properties associated with our various businesses.
Additionally, in connection with our ownership, management, and development of properties, we are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under some of these laws, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous or toxic substances or wastes on, under, or in such real property, as well as third-party sites where the owner or operator sent wastes for disposal. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew, or was at fault in connection with, the presence or release of such hazardous substances or wastes. Although we are not aware of any current material obligations for investigating or remediating hazardous substances or wastes at our owned properties, the future discovery of substances or wastes at any of our owned properties, or the failure to remediate such contaminated property properly, could adversely affect our ability to develop or sell such real estate, or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In addition, the costs of investigating or remediating contamination at our properties or at properties where we sent substances or wastes for disposal, may be substantial.
We are also subject to various requirements, including those contained in environmental permits required for our operations, governing air emissions, effluent discharges, the use, management, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and health and safety. From time to time, we may be required to manage, abate, or remove mold, lead, or asbestos-containing materials at our properties. We believe our properties and operations are in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state, and local environmental laws and ordinances. However, additional operating costs and capital expenditures could be incurred if additional or more stringent requirements are enacted in the future.
Human Capital and Corporate Responsibility
Our focus on “People Pleasing People” is at the heart of how we care for our guests, customers and employees. We recognize that our success is dependent on our employees’ commitment to delivering quality service to our guests and customers. Therefore, our strategic priorities include continuing to develop a committed team dedicated to service and fostering a diverse and inclusive culture that prioritizes wellbeing and emphasizes development and growth for all employees. 
Employees
As of December 29, 2022, we had approximately 8,050 employees, approximately 61% of whom were employed on a variable or part-time basis. A number of our employees at The Pfister Hotel and the Hilton Milwaukee City Center are covered by collective bargaining agreements which will expire on June 30, 2024, February 15, 2025, December 31, 2025 and May 31, 2028. A number of our employees at the AC Chicago Hotel are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which expires December 23, 2024. As of the end of fiscal 2022, approximately 5% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, none of which were covered by an agreement that will expire before December 28, 2023.
Employee Wellbeing and Retention
We believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations, and our management team routinely reviews employee turnover rates at various levels of the organization. Management also reviews employee engagement and satisfaction surveys to monitor employee morale and receive feedback on a variety of issues. We pay our employees competitively and offer a broad range of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive with others in our industry. Both of our operating divisions are experiencing challenges related to a labor shortage that has arisen as the country emerges from the pandemic. Difficulties in hiring new associates has impacted our ability to service our increasing customer counts in both theatres and hotels and increased labor costs. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our management teams and all of our employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required annual training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination.
