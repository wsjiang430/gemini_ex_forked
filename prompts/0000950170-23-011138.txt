 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 SCYNEXIS, Inc. is pioneering innovative medicines to potentially help millions of patients worldwide in need of new options to overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat and drug-resistant infections. We are developing our lead product candidate, ibrexafungerp, as a broad-spectrum, intravenous (IV)/oral agent for multiple fungal indications in both the community and hospital settings. In June 2021 and December 2022, we announced that the FDA approved BREXAFEMME (ibrexafungerp tablets) for treatment of patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), also known as vaginal yeast infection, and for the reduction in the incidence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), respectively. In October 2022, we announced that we were actively pursuing a U.S. commercialization partner to out-license BREXAFEMME in order to refocus our resources on the further clinical development of ibrexafungerp for severe, hospital-based indications, while keeping BREXAFEMME on the market and available to patients, and have ceased actively promoting BREXAFEMME.
On March 30, 2023, we entered into a license agreement (the License Agreement) with GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property (No. 3) Limited (GSK). Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, we granted GSK an exclusive (even as to us and our affiliates), royalty-bearing, sublicensable license for the development, manufacture, and commercialization of ibrexafungerp, including the approved product BREXAFEMME, for all indications, in all countries other than Greater China and certain other countries already licensed to third parties (the GSK Territory). If the existing licenses granted to or agreements with third parties are terminated with respect to any country, GSK will have an exclusive first right to negotiate with us to add those additional countries to the GSK Territory. We retain rights to all other assets, with GSK receiving a right of first negotiation (ROFN) to any other enfumafungin-derived compounds or products that we may control. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we are responsible for the execution and costs of the on-going clinical studies of ibrexafungerp for multiple indications, including the treatment of life-threatening invasive fungal infections caused primarily by Candida spp. (including C. auris) and Aspergillus spp. in hospitalized patients, and we have the potential to receive success-based milestones to offset those costs. The consummation of the transactions under the License Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the HSR Act); provided, that either we or GSK may terminate the License Agreement if expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act has not occurred within nine months of the signing of the License Agreement. The parties expect the transactions contemplated by the License Agreement to close in the second quarter of 2023 (such closing, the GSK Closing).
Under the terms of the License Agreement, we will receive an upfront payment of $90 million. We are also eligible to receive potential:
•regulatory approval milestone payments of up to $70 million;


•commercial milestone payments of up to $115 million based on first commercial sale in invasive candidiasis (U.S./EU); 
 •and sales milestone payments of up to $242.5 million based on annual net sales, with a total of $77.5 million to be paid upon achievement of multiple thresholds up through $200 million; a total of $65 million to be paid upon achievement of multiple thresholds between $300 million and $500 million; and $50 million to be paid at each threshold of $750 million and $1 billion.
 We will be responsible for the execution and costs of the ongoing clinical studies of ibrexafungerp but will have the potential to receive up to $75.5 million in success-based development milestones, which are comprised of up to $65 million for the achievement of three interim milestones associated with our continued performance of the ongoing MARIO Study and $10.5 million for the successful completion of the MARIO Study. See further details of the License Agreement as described in “Collaborations and Licensing Agreements Associated with Our Core Drug Development Operations - GSK” below.
 We, Hercules Capital, Inc. (Hercules Capital) and Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A. (SVB) are party to a Loan and Security Agreement dated as of May 13, 2021 (the Loan Agreement), pursuant to which Hercules Capital, SVB and each of the other lenders from time-to-time party to the Loan and Security Agreement (collectively, the Lenders) loaned to us $35 million. In connection with the entering into of the License Agreement, we entered into a First Amendment and Consent to Loan and Security Agreement with the Lenders pursuant to which the Lenders consented to us entering into the License Agreement and we agreed to pay to the Lenders an amount equal to the sum of (i) all outstanding principal plus all accrued and unpaid interest with respect to the amounts loaned under the Loan Agreement (approximately $35.4 million), (ii) the prepayment fee payable under Loan Agreement ($262,500), (iii) the final payment payable under Loan Agreement ($1,382,500), and (iv) all other sums, if any, that shall have become due and payable with respect to loan advances under the Loan Agreement. These payments by us will become due upon the earliest of (A) one business day following receipt by us of the $90 million upfront payment payable to us under the License Agreement, (B) June 1, 2023, or (C) the termination of the License Agreement.
 Ibrexafungerp, the first representative of a novel class of antifungal agents called triterpenoids, is a structurally distinct glucan synthase inhibitor and has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against a broad range of human fungal pathogens such as Candida and Aspergillus genera, including multidrug-resistant strains, as well as Pneumocystis, Coccidioides, Histoplasma and Blastomyces genera. Candida and Aspergillus genera are the fungi responsible for approximately 85% of all invasive fungal infections in the United States (U.S.) and Europe. To date, we have characterized the antifungal activity, pharmacokinetics, and safety profile of the oral and IV formulations of ibrexafungerp in multiple in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. The FDA has granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations to ibrexafungerp for the indications of VVC (including the prevention of recurrent VVC), invasive candidiasis (IC) (including candidemia), and invasive aspergillosis (IA), and has granted Orphan Drug designations for the IC and IA indications. The European Medicines Agency has granted Orphan Medicinal Product designation to ibrexafungerp for IC and the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency has granted ibrexafungerp the Innovation Passport designation for the treatment of IC. These designations may provide us (or GSK following the GSK Closing) with additional market exclusivity and/or expedited regulatory paths.
 BREXAFEMME
In June 2021, the FDA approved BREXAFEMME for use in patients with VVC. This approval was based on positive results from two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies (VANISH-303 and VANISH-306), in which oral ibrexafungerp demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo and a favorable tolerability profile in women with VVC. The FDA granted BREXAFEMME five years of exclusivity extension under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act, which is added to five years of new chemical entity (NCE) exclusivity, for a combined ten-year period of regulatory exclusivity. BREXAFEMME also is protected by multiple patents, including a composition-of-matter patent covering the ibrexafungerp molecule. With patent term extension, this patent is expected to expire in 2035, providing an expected 13 years of protection from generic competitors in the U.S. In December 2022, we announced that the FDA approved a second indication for BREXAFEMME for the reduction in the incidence of RVVC. This approval was based on positive results from the pivotal Phase 3 CANDLE study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of monthly dosing of ibrexafungerp to reduce the incidence of RVVC.
 In October 2022, we announced that we were actively pursuing a U.S. commercialization partner to out-license BREXAFEMME in order to refocus our resources on the further clinical development of ibrexafungerp for severe, hospital-based indications, while keeping BREXAFEMME on the market and available to patients, and have ceased actively promoting BREXAFEMME. As a result, we wound down our promotional activities associated with BREXAFEMME and we concluded the partnership with our contracted commercial sales partner, Amplity Health (Amplity), on November 30, 2022. On March 30, 2023, we entered into the License Agreement with GSK. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, we granted GSK an exclusive (even as to us and our affiliates), royalty-bearing, sublicensable license for the development, manufacture, and commercialization of ibrexafungerp, including the approved product BREXAFEMME, for all indications, in the GSK Territory.


Our Platform of Indications
Ibrexafungerp Hospital and Community Clinical Programs
 We continue to actively advance our clinical programs, leveraging the potential of ibrexafungerp to be a suitable treatment for multiple indications with significant unmet medical needs and considerable commercial opportunities. The following illustration summarizes the status of the indications for ibrexafungerp currently being pursued in the hospital and community settings, as well as our current expectations regarding the time of reporting data and, if the data supports it, the potential filing of an NDA and FDA approval (or, following the GSK Closing, if consistent with GSK’s strategy, the potential filing of an NDA by GSK and, if GSK submits an NDA at such time, the potential FDA approval):
Invasive Candidiasis and/or Candidemia
 Enrollment is continuing in our prospective, randomized, double-blind, global Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral ibrexafungerp as a step-down therapy for patients with IC including candidemia following IV echinocandin therapy in the hospital compared to currently available therapies (the MARIO study). Eligible patients with IC will receive treatment with IV echinocandin and will then be switched to either oral ibrexafungerp or a standard of care option, either oral fluconazole or best available therapy (BAT) for subjects with infections caused by fluconazole non-susceptible strains, once step-down criteria are met. Approximately 220 patients will be enrolled and randomized in the study, and we expect topline results in the first half of 2024 and a potential approval by the end of 2024.
 The primary objective of the study is to determine whether treatment of IC with IV echinocandins followed by oral ibrexafungerp is as effective as treatment with IV echinocandins followed by oral fluconazole (or BAT), the current standard of care. The primary end point of the study will be all-cause mortality at 30 days after initiation of antifungal therapy.
Refractory Invasive Fungal Infections (rIFI)
We achieved a target enrollment of 200 patients in our Phase 3 FURI study as well as the target enrollment of 30 patients in our Phase 3 CARES study. We anticipate study completion activities for both studies in the first half of 2023 follow by a Data Review Committee review and topline data in the first half of 2024. The data from the MARIO study along with data from FURI and CARES studies are intended to be supportive of an NDA submission in 2024 with an anticipated first approval for an indication in the hospital setting later in 2024.
 The FURI study is evaluating oral ibrexafungerp as a salvage treatment in patients with a variety of difficult-to-treat mucocutaneous and invasive fungal infections that are refractory to or intolerant of current standards of care, or require a non-azole oral step-down therapy for treatment of azole-resistant species. The CARES study is focused on hospitalized patients with invasive candidiasis caused by the multidrug-resistant Candida auris organism, which is associated with high mortality, and the

interim analysis was the first clinical trial data of an investigational treatment against infections caused by Candida auris. Candida auris has been recently declared an “Urgent Threat” to public health by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in its report, Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019, as it can be multidrug-resistant, has resulted in high mortality rates (up to 60%), and can be spread from patients (and surfaces) to patients, resulting in hospital outbreaks. The CARES study is intended to provide rapid access to oral ibrexafungerp for patients suffering from this life-threatening infection.
The open-label designs of the FURI and CARES studies permit evaluation of the data on an interim basis to further inform subsequent regulatory steps of the development program. We believe that compelling data from the FURI and/or CARES studies could allow ibrexafungerp to become eligible for the regulatory LPAD, potentially enabling an NDA submission (which would be by GSK following the GSK Closing) based on streamlined development. The LPAD was established under the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016, and FDA draft guidance issued in June 2019 suggests smaller, shorter or fewer clinical trials may be appropriate to support approval to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population with unmet needs. Positive clinical findings from these the FURI and CARES studies have so far reinforced the potential role of oral ibrexafungerp as a novel therapy to combat severe and difficult-to-treat fungal infections, including multidrug-resistant Candida auris.
 Invasive Aspergillosis
Based on promising pre-clinical data from combination use of ibrexafungerp with voriconazole, the current standard of care, vs. Aspergillus spp., we are conducting a Phase 2 study (SCYNERGIA study) of oral ibrexafungerp in combination with voriconazole in patients with IA. This study is a randomized, double-blind trial with the objective of assessing the safety and efficacy of oral ibrexafungerp in combination with voriconazole, compared to voriconazole alone. We believe that ibrexafungerp’s broad activity against Aspergillus spp., including azole-resistant strains, along with its minimal drug-drug interactions, high tissue penetration into the lungs, and oral formulation allowing for long-term administration, may make it an ideal candidate for use as combination therapy to provide improved outcomes vs. standard of care.
We have completed the enrollment of SCYNERGIA, although the number of patients is smaller than initially projected. The prioritization of hospital resources toward addressing COVID-19 has impacted the ability of many institutions to focus on screening and enrolling patients into some clinical trials, including SCYNERGIA. We expect to provide topline data for SCYNERGIA in the first half of 2023.
IV Ibrexafungerp Development Program
We have completed a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single and multiple ascending dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the liposomal IV formulation of ibrexafungerp in 64 healthy subjects with treatment durations of up to seven days. The liposomal IV formulation of ibrexafungerp was designed to optimize tolerability and address dose-limiting infusion site irritation adverse events observed with previous formulations. The study was conducted in South Africa and dosing began in March 2021 and the last cohort was completed in October 2021. The liposomal IV formulation of ibrexafungerp was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. The most common adverse events were mostly mild (a few moderate) reactions at the infusion site. The dosing was successfully progressed until the target exposure was achieved (i.e., exposure associated with efficacy from animal models). Should the GSK Closing not occur, we are planning to begin a Phase 2 study of the liposomal IV formulation in 2023.
 Treatment of VVC
 In the second quarter of 2022, enrollment began in a new Phase 3b, open-label, multicenter study (VANQUISH) to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral ibrexafungerp as a treatment for complicated VVC in patients who have failed treatment with fluconazole, based on mycological and clinical outcomes. The VANQUISH study will enroll approximately 150 complicated VVC patients who will receive 600 mg of oral ibrexafungerp for one, three or seven consecutive days determined by their underlying complicating condition, including immunocompromised state. Complicated patients include patients with recurrent VVC, those with VVC caused by non-albicans Candida species and those with diabetes, immunocompromising conditions (e.g., HIV), or immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., corticosteroids). The VANQUISH study will be conducted in approximately 25 centers in the U.S. and we are targeting to have data from this study in the first half of 2024.
 Preclinical Developments
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, we announced that a $3.0 million National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant was awarded to Case Western Reserve University researchers to study our second generation fungerp (SCY-247). SCY-247 is a broad-spectrum, antifungal under development by us and has as a potential oral and IV systemic therapeutic option for multiple drug-resistant pathogens. The grant is intended the further characterize the potential of SCY-247 to fight Candida auris, a multidrug-resistant pathogen named as an “urgent threat” by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and included in the “critical priority group” on the World Health Organization (WHO) fungal priority pathogens list (FPPL). Previous preclinical investigations

with SCY-247 have reported potent antifungal activity in in vitro studies, favorable pharmacokinetic profile and promising efficacy in mice models of invasive candidiasis. We plan to continue progressing the development of SCY-247 as a next generation fungerp in the fight against life-threatening fungal diseases.
Key Development Milestones
 We are seeking to achieve the following key milestones in the next 12 months:
 •close the transactions contemplated by the License Agreement with GSK in the second quarter of 2023; 
 •continue to advance enrollment of the MARIO study, a global Phase 3 study to evaluate ibrexafungerp as an oral step-down treatment for IC in the hospital setting;
 •provide topline data for the FURI and CARES studies in first half of 2024;
 •should the GSK Closing not occur, initiate a Phase 2 study of the liposomal IV formulation of ibrexafungerp in 2023; and
 •provide topline data for the Phase 2 SCYNERGIA study in the first half of 2023.
 Our Strategy
Key elements of our strategy include:
•to close the transactions contemplated by the License Agreement with GSK in the second quarter of 2023;
 •to further develop ibrexafungerp and obtain regulatory approval in major commercial markets for our key indications: invasive candidiasis, refractory invasive fungal infections, and invasive aspergillosis;
 •should the GSK Closing not occur, to contract with commercial partners to develop and commercialize ibrexafungerp outside of the U.S.; 
 •to leverage our strong scientific team to pursue the development of other internal proprietary compounds; and
 •to assess external opportunities for in-licensing to expand our development pipeline and add products for commercialization.
 Ibrexafungerp Target Product Profile
 Ibrexafungerp, the first agent in a novel antifungal class, acts through the inhibition of the glucan synthase complex, an established target in antifungal therapeutics. Ibrexafungerp is being developed as oral and IV formulations and has demonstrated potent activity against a large collection of medically relevant strains of Candida and Aspergillus genera, including multidrug-resistant strains, as well as Pneumocystis, Coccidioides, Histoplasma and Blastomyces genera. Additionally, ibrexafungerp has shown in vitro, in vivo and clinical activity against multidrug-resistant organisms such as Candida auris and synergistic/additive activity in combination with isavuconazole against Aspergillus strains and in

combination with amphotericin B against fungi causing mucormycosis. Ibrexafungerp has unique attributes that define its potential to address significant unmet medical needs and provide considerable commercial opportunities, including:
•oral bioavailability, unlike other glucan synthase inhibitors, allowing for convenient long-term outpatient use;
 •broad activity against Candida, Aspergillus, Pneumocystis, Coccidioides, Histoplasma and Blastomyces strains;
 •distinct chemical structure from other glucan synthase inhibitors, providing a unique spectrum of activity and pharmacokinetic profile;
 •activity against azole-resistant and most echinocandin-resistant Candida strains, including Candida auris and multidrug-resistant strains;
 •activity against azole-resistant Aspergillus strains;
 •fungicidal (i.e., killing the fungi) capabilities against the Candida genus compared to azoles, which are fungistatic (i.e., only inhibiting the growth of fungi); 
 •high tissue penetration, allowing high concentrations in the organs commonly affected by fungal infections;
 •generally well tolerated with over 1,600 subjects and patients exposed; and
 •20-hour half-life with a low risk of drug-drug interactions.
 We believe that ibrexafungerp, if approved, has the potential to address significant gaps with commercially available therapies in the following indications:
 •invasive candidiasis (including resistant infections);
 •invasive aspergillosis (including resistant infections); and
 •refractory invasive fungal infections.
 In the future, we (or our licensee GSK following the GSK Closing) may also consider other indications for ibrexafungerp for which longer oral antifungal regimens are typically needed and would benefit from the broad-spectrum activity, favorable safety profile and low potential for drug-drug interactions, including for the treatment of chronic fungal infections and for prophylaxis.
 For the treatment of invasive fungal infections, we expect that prescribing physicians will be located at major medical centers, where physicians specializing in critical care, infectious disease specialists, and physicians treating immune compromised or immuno-suppressed patients, such as oncologists and those performing solid organ transplants and stem cell transplants, are likely to be found.
 Market Opportunity
 Vaginal Yeast Infections
 VVC, commonly known as a vaginal yeast infection due to Candida, is the second most common cause of vaginitis. Although these infections are frequently caused by Candida albicans, infections caused by fluconazole-resistant and non-albicans Candida strains, such as Candida glabrata, have been reported to be on the rise. An estimated 70-75% of women worldwide will have at least one episode of VVC in their lifetime, and 40-50% of them will experience multiple episodes. VVC can be associated with substantial morbidity, including significant genital discomfort (pain, itching, burning), reduced sexual pleasure and activity, psychological distress (stress, depression, anxiety), embarrassment, reduced physical activity, and loss of productivity. Typical VVC symptoms include pruritus, vaginal soreness, irritation, excoriation of vaginal mucosa and abnormal vaginal discharge.
Current treatments for VVC include several topical azole antifungals and oral fluconazole, which is the only (other than BREXAFEMME) orally administered antifungal currently approved for the treatment of VVC in the U.S. and which accounts for over 90% of the prescriptions for VVC written each year, primarily by obstetrician and gynecologist (OGBYN) offices. Fluconazole reported a 55% therapeutic cure rate in its label, which now also includes warnings of potential fetal harm, illustrating the need for new oral alternatives. In addition, there are many women with persistent (chronic) infections, recurrent infections (four or more recurrences in a 12-month period), non-albicans / azole-resistant Candida strains (e.g., Candida glabrata), diabetic patients, especially with poorly controlled glycemia, and obese patients that could potentially benefit from a non-azole treatment. Except for BREXAFEMME, there are only azole class treatments available for women suffering from VVC with no other approved alternative class in the U.S. When a patient fails fluconazole therapy, patients typically are treated with more fluconazole or a topical azole. Women with VVC could benefit from a non-azole, and preferably oral, treatment option.

We believe BREXAFEMME has the potential to address vaginal yeast infections across a broad range of patients and could be an ideal treatment option for many patients for whom current treatment options are suboptimal. Despite yeast infections being so common and prevalent, with millions of women suffering from it every year, it is still an under-appreciated, under-reported, and under-served women’s health condition. Treatments for VVC have historically included several topical azole antifungals and oral fluconazole. Approximately 80% of VVC sufferers will have more than one yeast infection and over a third of women may have six yeast infections or more in a lifetime. There are over 17 million prescriptions written for VVC in the U.S. annually, all of which (prior to BREXAFEMME) belonged to a single drug class, the azoles. There had been no new oral treatment for VVC in over 25 years other than BREXAFEMME, and we believe health care providers are eager for a novel oral alternative to treat their patients.
 BREXAFEMME is the first and only approved oral, non-azole treatment for vaginal yeast infections. We believe that BREXAFEMME’s unique combination of features, including being from a novel class with a different mechanism of action, single-day oral dosing, broad spectrum, and fungicidal activity in all Candida species (albicans and non-albicans) including fluconazole-resistant strains, differentiates it from competing products.
 Invasive Candidiasis / rIFI
 Treatment options for invasive candidiasis are limited to three main drug classes: echinocandins, azoles, and amphotericin B. The echinocandins are considered the first line recommended therapy in most invasive candidiasis settings. Because the echinocandins can be administered only intravenously, orally administered azoles are often used as step-down agents after initial IV echinocandin therapy. However, antifungal treatment duration for invasive candidiasis typically extends for several weeks and patients for whom the azoles are not a suitable therapy due to resistance, intolerance, or risk of drug-to-drug interaction are restricted to use IV therapy for several weeks. Amphotericin B is also only available via IV administration and is associated with a significant risk of renal toxicity and infusion reactions, making it an unsuitable option in settings where there is underlying, or high risk of, renal impairment. Due to significant monitoring issues, Amphotericin B is also less desirable for outpatient parenteral administration. The echinocandins are typically well tolerated but clinical resistance is rising in many centers, due to development of mutations in the fks genes leading to echinocandin resistance and shift species with natural resistance as well as the rise of novel drug resistant species, such as Candida auris. When resistance develops, the available treatment options may be less efficacious or more toxic. The phenomenon of multi-drug resistance is also reported among isolates of different species of Candida, making the management of patients suffering from these infections extraordinarily challenging, considering the very limited treatment options available. Specifically, 90% of Candida auris isolates have been reported to be resistant to at least one antifungal agent and 30% isolates resistant to at least two antifungals.
There is a clear need for new antifungal treatment options for patients with invasive candidiasis that are refractory or intolerant to available therapies as well as for those who would benefit from oral therapy. We believe ibrexafungerp has the potential to address many of these unmet needs by providing a well-tolerated oral antifungal agent, with low risk for drug-drug interactions that has activity against azole-resistant and most echinocandin-resistant strains.
Invasive Aspergillosis
 Current treatment guidelines for IA in the U.S. and in Europe recommend the use of azoles (itraconazole, voriconazole or isavuconazole) as the initial first-line therapy. However, patients face unsatisfactory clinical outcomes with mortality rates ranging from 30% to 80% (depending on the stage of infection and the host underlying disease) and long treatment durations. Additionally, current azole therapies often exhibit drug-drug interactions, and the recent emergence of A. fumigatus azole-resistance is increasingly becoming of clinical concern worldwide.
Due to the significant rate of resistance in some countries, combination antifungal therapy as first-line treatment for patients suspected of IA is recommended. The combination of voriconazole or isavuconazole with a glucan synthesis inhibitor agent (IV echinocandin) is recommended at least until results of resistance testing are obtained. A previous study, by Marr et al. in IA patients demonstrated that the combination of an IV echinocandin and an IV/oral azole for two weeks followed by an oral azole alone for four additional weeks improved outcomes in certain patient subgroups. In this study, the combination regimen was given for only two weeks because of the limitations of using an IV echinocandin long-term in the outpatient setting. We believe that oral ibrexafungerp, if approved in combination with standard of care for the treatment of IA, would allow patients to receive the desired combination treatment of two agents with different mechanisms of action for the full six to twelve weeks of therapy, potentially leading to better outcomes.
Competition for Ibrexafungerp
 Our competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. The leading antifungal drugs representing each main class are as follows:
 Azoles. Noxafil® (posaconazole) marketed by Merck and Cresemba® (isavuconazole), approved in the U.S. and other global markets and marketed by Astellas in the U.S.; Diflucan® (fluconazole), Pfizer, off-patent with multiple generics,

Terazol (terconazole), Jannsen, off-patent with multiple generics, Gynazole (butoconazole), Perrigo, off patent with multiple generics;
 Echinocandins. Cancidas® (caspofungin), a product that became generic in March 2017, and Mycamine® (micafungin), a generic product. Pfizer markets the echinocandin Eraxis® (anidulafungin); and
 Polyenes. AmBisome® (liposomal amphotericin B), a product sold by Gilead in Europe, by Astellas in the U.S. and by Dainippon-Sumitomo in Japan.
 Pfizer, Merck, Astellas, and Gilead are all large pharmaceutical companies with significant experience and financial resources in the marketing and sale of specialty pharmaceuticals. Various other producers market and sell generic oral voriconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole.
 The VVC market has three generic prescription agents, fluconazole (oral), terconazole and butoconazole (topical), manufactured by multiple generic companies. There is limited to no marketing to support these generic products. In 2022, oral oteseconazole (brand name Vivjoa), developed and marketed by Mycovia Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was approved for the reduction in the incidence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in women who are not of reproductive potential. Recently, in March 2023, the long-acting IV echinocandin Rezafungin (brand name Rezzayo) being developed by Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.and marketed by Melinta Therapeutics, was approved for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults with limited or no alternative treatment options. Other antifungals in development include Fosmanogepix (APX-001) being developed by Amplyx Pharmaceuticals Inc., the polyene amphotericin B oral formulation MAT2203 being developed by Matinas BioPharma Holdings Inc., and Olorofim (F901318) being developed by F2G Limited. These companies may have greater resources than ours.
 We believe that ibrexafungerp has the ability to perform well in the future fungal infection market given the limited competitive marketplace, the unmet medical need, and the often high mortality rate of many of these infections. The key competitive factors affecting the success of ibrexafungerp, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, use in outpatient settings, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. If approved, we believe that ibrexafungerp’s unique features, including being from a novel antifungal class, broad-spectrum of activity including resistant strains, IV and oral formulations, fungicidal activity versus Candida, high tissue penetration, and favorable safety profile, will differentiate it from competing products and allow premium pricing to generics and other competing products.
 The commercial opportunity for ibrexafungerp could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we or GSK may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA, or other regulatory, approval for their products more rapidly than we or GSK obtains approval for our ibrexafungerp products. In addition, the commercial success of ibrexafungerp may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. In the azole class, fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and oral voriconazole are generic. Caspofungin, the largest selling echinocandin, is now available on a generic basis. If approved, we believe ibrexafungerp will be capable of delivering value supportive of premium pricing over competitive generic products.
 Manufacturing and Supply of Ibrexafungerp
 We have agreements with external vendors that are capable of supplying drug substance and of producing drug product to support ongoing and planned clinical trials, as well as for commercial product. However, we do not own or operate and do not intend to own or operate facilities for manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing of drug substance or drug product. We have relied on third-party contract manufacturers for synthesis of our clinical compounds and manufacture of drug product. We expect to continue to rely on either existing or alternative third-party manufacturers to supply ibrexafungerp for our performance of clinical trials and for supplying GSK needs for clinical and commercial product until it obtains its own source of supply.
 Ibrexafungerp is a semi-synthetic compound. Thus, the manufacturing process for ibrexafungerp involves fermentation and synthetic chemical steps. The synthetic process does not require any specialized equipment and uses readily sourced intermediates. At commercial scale, we expect cost of goods for ibrexafungerp to be similar to that of other small molecule drugs. We have negotiated agreements with our primary contract manufacturers to produce both drug product and drug substance for our current clinical trials and for GSK’s clinical and commercial needs.
We estimate our supplies on hand as well as those we plan to produce for the oral formulation of ibrexafungerp are sufficient to supply our ongoing clinical trials as well as to support GSK’s clinical and commercial needs. Additional batches of both oral and IV ibrexafungerp drug product will be manufactured as needed to support the subsequent stages of clinical development plan and commercial supply requirements.


A drug manufacturing program subject to extensive governmental regulations requires robust quality assurance systems and experienced personnel with the relevant technical and regulatory expertise as well as strong project management skills. We believe we have a team that is capable of managing these activities until GSK assumes responsibility for them pursuant to the License Agreement.
The primary third-party vendors with which we have agreements in place to support manufacturing and supply both for clinical development and commercial needs have the required capabilities with respect to facilities, equipment and technical expertise, quality systems that meet global regulatory and compliance requirements, satisfactory regulatory inspection history from relevant health authorities and proven track records in supplying drug substance and drug product for late-stage clinical and commercial use.
 Collaborations and Licensing Agreements Associated with Our Core Drug Development Operations
 We have a number of licensing and collaboration agreements associated with our core drug development operations, including the following:
 GSK
 On March 30, 2023 we entered into a License Agreement with GSK. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, we granted GSK an exclusive (even as to us and our affiliates), royalty-bearing, sublicensable license for the development, manufacture, and commercialization of ibrexafungerp, including the approved product BREXAFEMME, for all indications, in the GSK Territory. If the existing licenses granted to or agreements with third parties are terminated with respect to any country, GSK will have an exclusive first right to negotiate with us to add those additional countries to the GSK Territory. We retain rights to all other assets, with GSK receiving a ROFN to any other enfumafungin-derived compounds or products that we may control.
 Under the terms of the License Agreement, we will receive an upfront payment of $90 million. We are also eligible to receive potential:
•regulatory approval milestone payments of up to $70 million;
 •commercial milestone payments of up to $115 million based on first commercial sale in invasive candidiasis (U.S./EU); 
 •and sales milestone payments of up to $242.5 million based on annual net sales, with a total of $77.5 million to be paid upon achievement of multiple thresholds up through $200 million; a total of $65 million to be paid upon achievement of multiple thresholds between $300 million and $500 million; and $50 million to be paid at each threshold of $750 million and $1 billion.
 We will be responsible for the execution and costs of the ongoing clinical studies of ibrexafungerp but will have the potential to receive up to $75.5 million in success-based development milestones, which are comprised of up to $65 million for the achievement of three interim milestones associated with our continued performance of the ongoing MARIO Study and $10.5 million for the successful completion of the MARIO Study.
 In the case of each of the above milestones, such milestone events are defined in the License Agreement. GSK will also pay royalties based on cumulative annual sales to us in the mid-single digit to mid-teen range. These royalty rates are subject to reduction, including in the event of third-party licenses, entry of a generic product, or the expiration of licensed patents. A joint development committee will be established between GSK and us to coordinate and review ongoing development activities of ibrexafungerp. Unless earlier terminated, the License Agreement will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis at the end of the royalty term for such product in such country.
We have the right to terminate the License Agreement upon an uncured material breach by, or bankruptcy of, GSK. GSK has the right to terminate the License Agreement at any time for convenience in its entirety or on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, upon an uncured material breach by, or bankruptcy of, us, or for safety reasons.
 The consummation of the transactions under the License Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act”); provided, that either we or GSK may terminate the License Agreement if expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act has not occurred within nine months of the signing of the License Agreement. The parties expect the transactions contemplated by the License Agreement to close in the second quarter of 2023.
 Merck
 We initially discovered and developed ibrexafungerp through a research collaboration with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (Merck), a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. In May 2013, Merck transferred to us all development and commercialization rights for ibrexafungerp (also known as MK-3118). This decision was made following a review and prioritization of Merck’s

infectious disease portfolio. Under the terms of the agreement, we received all human health rights to ibrexafungerp, including all related technical documents, preclinical data, data from the seven Phase 1 trials conducted by Merck, and drug product and drug substance. The agreement continues until expiration of all royalty obligations. The agreement may be terminated if either party is in material breach and fails to remedy the breach after receiving written notice. In January 2014, Merck assigned the patents to us related to ibrexafungerp that it had exclusively licensed to us. Under the terms of the patent assignment, Merck no longer has responsibility to maintain the patents. Merck was originally eligible to receive milestones upon initiation of a Phase 2 clinical study, NDA submission and marketing approvals in each of the U.S., major European markets and Japan that could total up to $19 million. In addition, Merck will receive tiered royalties based on worldwide sales of ibrexafungerp. The aggregate royalties are mid- to high-single digits of net sales, and we expect to pay royalties on net sales of ibrexafungerp to Merck for no more than ten years from first commercial launch, on a country-by-country basis.
 In December 2014, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement with Merck that defers the remittance of a milestone payment due to Merck, such that no amount will be due upon initiation of the first phase 2 clinical trial of a product containing the ibrexafungerp compound (the Deferred Milestone). The amendment also increased, in an amount equal to the Deferred Milestone, the milestone payment that will be due upon initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a product containing the ibrexafungerp compound. In December 2016 and January 2019, we entered into second and third amendments to the license agreement with Merck which clarified what would constitute the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial for the purpose of a milestone payment. In January 2019, a milestone payment became due to Merck as a result of the initiation of the VANISH Phase 3 VVC program and it was paid in March 2019.
On December 2, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to the license agreement with Merck. The amendment eliminates two cash milestone payments that we would have paid to Merck upon the first filing of a NDA, triggered by the FDA acceptance for filing of our NDA for ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC, and first marketing approval in the U.S. in June 2021 for our NDA for ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC. These cash milestone payments would have been creditable against future royalties owed to Merck on net sales of ibrexafungerp. With the amendment, these milestones will not be paid in cash and, accordingly, credits will not accrue. Pursuant to the amendment, we will also forfeit the credits against future royalties that had accrued from a prior milestone payment already paid to Merck. All other key terms of the license agreement are unchanged.
Hansoh
 In February 2021, we entered into an Exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement (the Agreement) with Hansoh (Shanghai) Health Technology Co., Ltd., and Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Company Limited (collectively, Hansoh), pursuant to which we granted to Hansoh an exclusive license to research, develop and commercialize ibrexafungerp in the Greater China region, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Under the terms of the Agreement, Hansoh shall be responsible for the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of ibrexafungerp in Greater China. We received a $10.0 million upfront payment and will also be eligible to receive up to $112.0 million in development and commercial milestones, plus low double-digit royalties on net product sales. The obligation to pay royalties with respect to sales in a specified region will continue until the later of the date of expiration of all intellectual property and regulatory exclusivity for the product in the region and ten years from the first commercial sale, unless earlier terminated by Hansoh with advanced notice for convenience or under other specified circumstances.
 R-Pharm
 In August 2013, we entered into an agreement with R-Pharm, CJSC (R-Pharm), a leading supplier of hospital drugs in Russia, granting them exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ibrexafungerp in the field of human health in Russia, Turkey, and certain Balkan, Central Asian, Middle Eastern and North African countries. We retained the right to commercialize ibrexafungerp in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. In November 2014, we entered into a supplemental arrangement with R-Pharm, whereby R-Pharm was informed of the modified IV formulation development plan and R-Pharm agreed to reimburse us for specifically identified IV formulation development and manufacturing costs incurred by us. We received a non-refundable upfront payment of $1.5 million from R-Pharm in August 2013 which was recognized over a period of 70 months and is fully amortized.
 Government Regulation
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug Approval Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recall requests, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND) which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication, subject to on-going IRB review;
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations and guidance, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application.
 Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which in some cases may overlap or be combined:


Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
 Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population with the target disease to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population with the target disease, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials sometimes cannot be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.
 In some circumstances, the FDA may also order a sponsor to conduct post-approval clinical trials if new safety information arises raising questions about the drug’s risk-benefit profile. Those clinical trials are typically referred to as Post-Marketing Requirements (PMRs).
 GAIN Act
 The FDA has various expedited development programs, including break-through therapy, fast track designation and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that meet certain qualifications. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 The GAIN Act is intended to encourage development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections by providing certain benefits to sponsors, including extended exclusivity periods, fast track and priority review. To be eligible for these benefits a product in development must seek and be awarded designation as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP).
 To qualify as a QIDP according to the criteria established in the GAIN Act, a product must be an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including, those:
 •caused by an antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens; or
 •qualifying pathogens listed by the FDA in accordance with the GAIN Act.
 Fast Track Designation
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor's request.
 If a drug candidate is granted Fast Track designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may review sections of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA's time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.


Post Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post‑approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑marketing studies or surveillance programs.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications. However, pharmaceutical companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting their promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative liability.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Pediatric Exclusivity
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of regulatory protection to the term of any existing exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity periods described above, and to the regulatory term of any patent that has been submitted to FDA for the approved drug product. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study or studies in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study or studies.
Qualified Infectious Disease Product Exclusivity
 If the NDA for a QIDP is approved by the FDA, the FDA will extend by an additional five years any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded, such as a five-year exclusivity period awarded for a new chemical entity. This extension is in addition to any pediatric exclusivity extension awarded. Eligibility for the extension will be denied if the product is approved for uses that would not meet the definition of a QIDP.
Data Privacy and Security
 In the ordinary course of our business, we may process confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information, including personal data. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy and security. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (EU GDPR), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (UK) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (UK GDPR), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy and

security laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act. Additionally, we are, or may become, subject to various U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws which require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data.
 The CCPA and EU GDPR are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal data processing that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA), effective January 1, 2023, expanded the CCPA by, among other things, giving California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establishing restrictions on personal data retention, expanding the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establishing a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law.
 Foreign data privacy and security laws (including but not limited to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. As one example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances.
 See the section titled “Risk Factors” for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States our activities are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, such as the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. These laws include the following:
 •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;
 •the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
 •the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;


•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates,” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, as well as analogous state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and
 •analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
 For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and payment transparency laws.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, and contractual damages.
 Foreign Regulation
 To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Our ability to commercialize BREXAFEMME and any of our product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which the United States and foreign governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors establish appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for our product candidates and related treatments. In many of the markets where we would commercialize a product following regulatory approval, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls (by law) and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. One third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product candidate. As a result, the coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly.
 Increasingly, third party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. The Company may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of its products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require the Company to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of its products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Additionally, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies when a competing generic product is available. Under Medicare, hospitals are reimbursed under an inpatient prospective payment system. This pricing methodology provides a single payment

amount to hospitals based on a given diagnosis-related group. As a result, with respect to Medicare reimbursement for services in the hospital inpatient setting, hospitals could have a financial incentive to use the least expensive drugs for the treatment of invasive fungal infections, particularly the IV formulations of these drugs, as they are typically administered in the hospital. Further, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
Public and private health care payors control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payors also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. In particular, many public and private health care payors limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA or that are supported by other appropriate evidence (for example, published medical literature) and appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed reforms of the healthcare system to contain costs, improve quality, and expand access to care. For example, in the United States the Affordable Care Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. There have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the "donut hole" under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is also unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act and the Company's business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will stay in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken.. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for the Company's drugs, if approved, and accordingly, the Company's financial operations.
  There also has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, Presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example. in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. Further, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Additionally, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Intellectual Property


We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, and their methods of use and other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 As of March 1, 2023, we are the owner of more than ten issued U.S. patents and more than 125 issued non-U.S. patents with claims to novel compounds, compositions containing them, processes for their preparation, and their uses as pharmaceutical agents, with terms expiring between 2027 and 2038. Of these patents, six U.S. patents relate to ibrexafungerp. We are actively pursuing several U.S. patent applications and many non-U.S. patent applications in multiple jurisdictions worldwide.
 Ibrexafungerp is protected in the United States by an issued composition of matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 8,188,085); three issued patents related to ibrexafungerp salts and polymorphs, including the citrate salt used in BREXAFEMME and our ongoing clinical trials; and two patents covering uses of ibrexafungerp in treatment or prevention of fungal infections. The ‘085 patent is currently set to expire in 2030. We have applied for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) and believe that the term of the ‘085 patent will be extended into 2035. The three patents covering the citrate salt of ibrexafungerp expire in 2035. The two patents covering uses of ibrexafungerp expire in 2038. The ibrexafungerp composition of matter is covered by a patent in more than 60 jurisdictions worldwide, with several more patent applications pending. Additional patent applications related to ibrexafungerp’s formulations and use as an antifungal agent have been filed and are currently pending. If granted, the new patent families could extend the patent protection for certain ibrexafungerp formulations or uses up to 2040. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology and processes, please see the section on “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
