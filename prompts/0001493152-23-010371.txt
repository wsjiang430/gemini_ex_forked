Item 1. Description of Business.
Overview
 
Transportation and Logistics Systems, Inc. (“TLSS” or the “Company”) is a publicly-traded holding company. Its active wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, Cougar Express, Freight Connections, JFK Cartage, and Severance Trucking Co., Inc. (acquired in 2023, along with Severance Warehousing, Inc. and McGrath Leasing, Inc., together Severance Trucking), together provide a full suite of logistics and transportation services, specializing in ecommerce fulfillment, last mile deliveries, two-person home delivery, mid-mile, and long-haul services. Such entities operate several warehouse locations located in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Inactive subsidiaries include: TLSSA, Shyp CX, Shyp FX, TLSS-FC, TLSS-STI.
 
We are primarily an asset-based point-to-point delivery company. An asset-based delivery company, as compared to a non-asset-based delivery company, owns its own transportation equipment and employs its own drivers. As of December 31, 2022, through our active subsidiaries, we owned approximately 32 vehicles consisting of trucks, box trucks and vans, 14 trailers, and 15 forklifts, while employing approximately 23 drivers.
 
In addition, our operations utilize the services of independent contractors, who generally use their own vehicles, on an as needed basis.
 
Since exiting the Amazon business (see below), we have pursued a growth by acquisitions strategy as set forth below and, as such, continue to pursue potential acquisition opportunities.
 
On November 13, 2020, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Shyp FX, under the laws of the State of New Jersey. On January 15, 2021, through Shyp FX, we simultaneously executed an asset purchase agreement and closed a transaction to acquire substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of Double D Trucking, Inc., a northern New Jersey-based logistics provider specializing in servicing Federal Express over the past 25 years (“DDTI”). On June 21, 2022, we sold substantially all the assets of Shyp FX in an all-cash transaction. See details below under “Acquisitions”.
 
On November 16, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, TLSSA, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. On March 24, 2021, TLSSA, acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Cougar Express, a New York-based full-service logistics provider specializing in pickup, warehousing, and delivery services in the New York City tri-state area. See details below under “Acquisitions”.
 
On February 21, 2021, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp CX, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. Shyp CX does not engage in any revenue-generating operations and is currently inactive.
 
On August 4, 2022, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cougar Express, closed on its acquisition of all outstanding stock of JFK Cartage., a New York-based full-service logistics provider specializing in pickup, warehousing and delivery services in the tri-state area. See details below under “Acquisitions”.
 
Effective September 16, 2022, our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, TLSS-FC, closed on an acquisition of all outstanding stock of Freight Connections, a New Jersey-based company offering an array of transportation, warehousing, consolidating, distribution, and local cartage services throughout the New York tri-state area. See details below under “Acquisitions”.
 
Effective February 3, 2023, our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, TLSS-STI, closed on an acquisition of all outstanding stock of Severance Trucking, which offers less-than-truckload (LTL) trucking services throughout New England, with an effective date as of the close of business on January 31 2023. See details below under “Acquisitions”.
 One of the Sellers also entered into a consulting agreement, including non-competition and non-solicitation provisions, to continue with Severance after the acquisition for a period of no less than three (3) months and no more than one (1) year.
 
We have a highly experienced and dedicated senior management team, which is currently evaluating various opportunities, whether by acquisition or otherwise, for the Company to augment its current business and/or enter into new line(s) of business. While the Company is hopeful that it will be able to announce a plan in this regard shortly, there can be no assurance that we will in fact be able to augment our current business and/or enter into new line(s) of business or to do so profitably.
 
Corporate History
 
TLSS was incorporated under the name “PetroTerra Corp.” in the State of Nevada on July 25, 2008. Prior to March 2017, TLSS was an independent oil or gas exploration and development company focused on the acquisition or lease of properties that potentially contained extractable oil or gas. However, at that time, we had not generated any revenues and, due to a decline of the oil and gas markets, elected to seek other business opportunities.
 
On March 30, 2017, TLSS entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, dated as of the same date, with Save on Transport Inc., a Florida-based non-asset provider of integrated transportation management solutions, including brokerage and logistics services related to the transportation of automobiles and other freight (“Save on Transport”), pursuant to which we acquired Save on Transport as a wholly owned subsidiary. TLSS’s acquisition of Save on Transport was treated as a reverse merger and recapitalization of Save on Transport for financial reporting purposes because the Save on Transport shareholders retained an approximate 80% controlling interest in our consolidated company. Save on Transport was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, and our historical financial statements before the acquisition transaction were replaced with the historical financial statements of Save on Transport before such acquisition. The balance sheets at their historical cost basis of both entities were combined at the acquisition date and the results of operations from the acquisition date forward included the historical results of Save on Transport and our combined results of operations from the acquisition date forward. On May 1, 2019, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Save On and Steven Yariv, whereby the Company returned all of the stock of Save On to Steven Yariv in exchange for Mr. Yariv conveying 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company back to the Company.

On June 18, 2018, TLSS completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Prime EFS from its members pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Stock Purchase Agreement entered into among the Company and the Prime EFS members on the Acquisition Date.
 
On July 24, 2018, TLSS formed Shypdirect LLC, a company organized under the laws of New Jersey. Since its inception, Shypdirect generated substantially all of its revenues from Amazon.
 
Between June 18, 2018 and September 30, 2020, we operated through Prime EFS and Shypdirect. The great bulk of Prime EFS’s business prior to September 30, 2020 was conducted pursuant to the Delivery Service Provider program (the “Prime EFS DSP Program”) of Amazon Logistics, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”). In June 2020, Amazon gave notice to Prime EFS that Amazon would not be renewing the Prime EFS DSP Program agreement when that agreement terminated effective September 30, 2020. Prime EFS ceased operations on September 30, 2020 due to Amazon’s non-renewal of the Prime EFS DSP Program. Shypdirect conducted its business as a carrier under a relay program service agreement with Amazon (the “Program Agreement”). On July 17, 2020, Amazon notified Shypdirect that Amazon had elected to terminate the Program Agreement, effective as of November 14, 2020 (the “Shypdirect Termination Notice”). On August 3, 2020, Amazon offered to withdraw the Shypdirect Termination Notice and extend the term of the Program Agreement to and including May 14, 2021 (the “Aug. 3 Proposal”). On August 4, 2020, the Company, Prime EFS and Shypdirect accepted the Aug. 3 Proposal. The Program Agreement expired on May 14, 2021. In June 2021, Shypdirect ceased its tractor trailer and box truck delivery services to Amazon, and in July 2021, Shypdirect ceased all operations.
 
Approximately 28.5% of our revenue of $5,495,146 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to Shypdirect’s now terminated mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon. The termination of the Prime EFS last-mile business with Amazon on September 30, 2020 had a material adverse impact on the operations of Prime EFS beginning in the 4th fiscal quarter of 2020 and the termination of Shypdirect’s Amazon mid-mile and long-haul business, which was effective on or about May 14, 2021, had a material adverse impact on operations of Shypdirect beginning in the 2nd fiscal quarter of 2021. This impact caused Prime EFS and Shypdirect to become insolvent and to cease operations.
 
On August 16, 2021, Prime EFS and Shypdirect executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors in the State of New Jersey pursuant to N.J.S.A. §2A:19-1, et seq. (the “ABC Statute”), assigning all Prime EFS and Shypdirect assets to Terri Jane Freedman as Assignee for the Benefit of Creditors (the “Assignee”) and filing for dissolution. An “Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors,” “general assignment” or “ABC” in New Jersey is a state-law, voluntary, judicially-supervised corporate liquidation and unwinding similar to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy process found in the United States Bankruptcy Code. In an ABC, debtor companies, here Prime EFS and Shypdirect, together referred to as the “Assignors”, executed Deeds of Assignment, assigning all their assets to the Assignee chosen by the Company, who acts as a fiduciary similar to a Chapter 7 trustee in bankruptcy. On September 7, 2021, the ABCs were filed with the Bergen County Clerk in Bergen County, New Jersey and filed with the Surrogate Court, Bergen County, initiating judicial proceedings. The Assignee has been charged with liquidating the assets for the benefit of the Prime EFS and Shypdirect creditors pursuant to the provisions of the ABC Statute.
 
As a result of Prime EFS and Shypdirect’s filing of the executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors on September 7, 2021, the Assignee assumed all authority to manage Prime EFS or Shypdirect. Additionally, Prime EFS and Shypdirect no longer conduct any business and are not permitted by the Assignee and ABC Statute to conduct any business. For these reasons, effective September 7, 2021, we relinquished control of Prime EFS and Shypdirect. Further, on October 13, 2021, Prime EFS and Shypdirect filed for dissolution with the Secretary of State of New Jersey. Therefore, we deconsolidated Prime EFS and Shypdirect effective with the filing of executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors in September 2021. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 include the results of Prime EFS and Shypdirect prior to the September 7, 2021 filing of the executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors with the State of New Jersey.
 
On November 13, 2020, TLSS formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Shyp FX, under the laws of the State of New Jersey. On January 15, 2021, through Shyp FX, we executed an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) and closed a transaction to acquire substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of DDTI. On April 28, 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement” with an unrelated third party. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Shyp FX sold substantially all its asset and specific liabilities. The Asset Purchase Agreement closed in June 2022
 
On November 16, 2020, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TLSSA, under the laws of the State of Delaware. On March 24, 2021, TLSSA acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Cougar Express.
 
On February 21, 2021, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Shyp CX, under the laws of the State of New York. Shyp CX does not engage in any revenue-generating operations and is currently inactive.
 
On August 17, 2022, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TLSS-FC, under the laws of the State of Delaware. On September 16, 2022, TLSS-FC acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Freight Connections. TLSS-FC does not engage in any revenue-generating operations and is currently inactive.
 
On January 27, 2023, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TLSS-STI, under the laws of the State of Delaware. On January 31, 2023, TLSS-STI acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Severance Trucking. TLSS-STI does not engage in any revenue-generating operations and is currently inactive.
 
Our principal executive offices are located in the United States at 5500 Military Trail, Suite 22-357, Jupiter, Florida 33458, and our telephone number is (833) 764-1443. The Company’s website is www.tlss-inc.com.
 
Company Overview
 
E-Commerce Fulfillment Solutions
 
The rapid growth of e-commerce and the online retailing segment of e-commerce is well documented. Online retail companies have logistics needs that differ from those of traditional businesses. Unlike traditional inventory management, e-commerce companies need to ship items directly to customers, who expect their orders to arrive on time and as described. We have built our delivery services to perform effectively in the “on demand” shipping environment that is part of the e-commerce fulfillment solutions system. We are currently looking to offer the expertise and knowledge we have in this area to new customers.

Our Strategy and Competitive Strengths
 
As a result of the termination of Prime EFS’s involvement with Amazon’s DSP Program and the termination of Shypdirect’s involvement with Amazon’s Relay Carrier Terms of Service, we began the process of diversifying our business primarily starting with the acquisition of Cougar Express and the assets of DDTI. In 2022, we acquired the businesses of JFK Cartage and Freight Connections. Most recently, in 2023, we acquired Severance Trucking. Our strategy is to be a leader in the transportation industry by providing on-time, high-quality pick-up, transportation, and long-haul, mid-mile and last-mile delivery services.
 
Market Knowledge and Understanding. While we have been operating our current business for only a few years, our senior management personnel collectively have more than 40 years of experience in the transportation industry and broad knowledge in providing transportation services. These solutions are in high demand, and we hope to grow our business more profitably than was experienced in prior periods. Members of our senior management team have operational experience both within and without the transportation and logistics industry together with extensive experience in business growth and acquisitions. We believe we understand the various segments of the end-to-end solutions required to deliver goods rapidly and accurately between the various pick-up and delivery points in the delivery chain.
 
Unwavering Focus on Relationships and Superior Service. We aim to be the premier platform and partner of choice for our customers. We believe we offer superior services and solutions due to our company-wide commitment to customer service.
 
Experienced and Proven Management Team. We believe our management team is among the most experienced in the industry. Our senior management team brings experience in transportation and logistics, mergers and acquisitions, information technology, e-commerce retailing and fulfillment.
 
We hope to leverage our competitive strengths to increase shareholder value through the following core strategies.
 
Pursue Value-Enhancing Strategic Acquisitions. We intend to pursue strategic acquisitions as a means of adding new markets in the United States, expanding our transportation and logistics service offerings, adding talented management and operational employees, expanding, and upgrading our technology platform and developing operational best practices. We are currently at various stages of reviewing several potential acquisition targets and believe we have significant opportunities to grow our business through our knowledge of our industry and possible acquisition targets.
 
Build Upon Strong Customer Relationships to Expand Organically. We intend to utilize our strategic acquisitions to facilitate organic growth through leveraging our product and service capabilities, expanding the size of our service area, and adding higher margin services to our service offerings.
 
Expand Our Operations to Other Regions of the U.S. Our mid-mile and long-haul delivery services are currently provided in the eastern United States. As we continue to expand our marketing and customer relationships, we anticipate expanding our geographic footprint to provide such services, and to capture market share, in other regions of the U.S. by opening our own operations centers and warehouses, acquiring existing regional transportation and logistics companies operating in other areas and partnering with local operators in other regions. We believe the expansion of our business in other regions of the U.S. will also allow us to expand our relationships with existing customers who operate in those regions.
 
Enhance Our Operating Margins. We hope to enhance our operating margins through a combination of increased operational efficiencies, leveraging our existing assets and distribution facilities and increasing our usage of technology to help us better plan, execute and monitor the performance of our services and transportation assets.
 
Technology
 
An integral part of our operating philosophy is the utilization of technology to support our transportation services and provide our employees with real time information on the status of our operations. We believe our focus on technology as a support to our operations allows our employees to focus on performing at high levels for the benefit of our customers.
 
We are also exploring technology-based acquisition opportunities that can provide higher margin solution-based products and services.
 
Customers and Markets
 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers accounted for 22.8% of the Company’s total net revenues (11.9% and 10.9%, respectively). For the year ended December 31, 2021, four customers represented 74.5% of the Company’s total net revenues (28.5%, 21.6%, 12.5% and 11.9%, respectively).
 
Accordingly, we continue to have customer concentration risk, which we hope to address by expanding our organic growth through the addition of new customers and through the acquisition of businesses that provide transportation services for new customer bases.
 
Acquisitions
 
On January 15, 2021, through Shyp FX, we simultaneously executed an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) and closed a transaction to acquire substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of DDTI. DDTI’s annual revenues in 2020 exceeded $1 million. The purchase price under the APA was $100,000 of cash and a promissory note of $400,000. The principal assets involved in the acquisition were vehicles for cargo transport, system equipment for vehicle tracking and navigation of vehicles, and delivery route rights together with assumption of associated customer relationships. The acquisition of DDTI made the Company an approved contracted service provider of FedEx, which, we believe, fits in well with our current geographic coverage area and may lead to additional expansion opportunities within the FedEx network. On June 21, 2022, we sold substantially all the assets of Shyp FX in an all-cash transaction. The purchaser was Farhoud Logistics Inc., a New Jersey corporation, an unrelated party. Under the terms of the sale, The Company sold the assets of Shyp FX consisting of transportation equipment and other equipment and the business of Shyp FX for $825,000. We received net proceeds of $748,500 which is net of a broker commission of $75,000 and other expenses of $4,214. $25,000 was held in escrow, pending bulk sale tax clearance from the State of New Jersey and to cover the estimated cost of a vehicle repair. We received the escrowed funds during the fourth quarter of 2022. In connection with the sale of these assets, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a gain on the sale of $293,975.

On November 11 2020, our wholly owned subsidiary, TLSSA, entered into an asset purchase agreement dated as of November 6, 2020 (“APA”), to acquire substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of Cougar Express. Cougar Express was a family-owned full-service transportation business that has been in operation for more than 30 years providing one-to-four person deliveries and offering white glove services. It utilizes its own fleet of trucks, warehouse/driver/office personnel and on-call subcontractors from its convenient and secure New York JFK airport area location, allowing it to pick-up and deliver throughout the New York tri-state area. Cougar Express serves a diverse base of 50 commercial accounts, which are freight forwarders that work with some of the most notable retail businesses in the country. Some of Cougar Express’s accounts have been customers of Cougar Express for more than 20 years. On March 24, 2021, TLSS Acquisition acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Cougar Express. The purchase price was $2,000,000 of cash plus cash for the acquisition of security deposits, a cash payment equal to 50% of the difference between cash and accounts receivable acquired and accounts payable assumed, less the assumption of truck loans and leases, and a promissory note of $350,000. The previous owner of Cougar Express is barred from competing with the Cougar Express business through March 24, 2026.
 
On August 4, 2022, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Cougar Express, closed on its acquisition of all outstanding stock of JFK Cartage, a New York-based full-service logistics provider specializing in pickup, warehousing and delivery services in the tri-state area. Ms. Joan Ton, the sole shareholder of JFK Cartage, from whom the shares were acquired, is an unrelated party (the “JFK Cartage Seller”). The effective date of the acquisition was July 31, 2022. JFK Cartage operates from a 30,000 square foot warehouse with ten drive-in doors and is strategically located approximately six miles from JFK International Airport. JFK Cartage has been in business since 2008 and has been providing warehousing, cross-dock services, pickup and deliveries, and general trucking, handling airfreight, trade show freight, expedited and hotshot demand work, LTL/cartage as well as FTL, reverse logistics, white glove and residential delivery services to a broad base of over 95 commercial accounts and residential customers. JFK Cartage operates a wide-ranging fleet of specialty vehicles, from its Sprinter vans to full 53-ft. tractor trailers. JFK Cartage, with its assets, fleet and warehouse is believed to be one of the largest leading cartage agents serving the New York Tri-State area. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement with Cougar Express and JFK Cartage dated May 24, 2022, the purchase price was $1,700,000, subject to certain adjustments. The Company: (i) paid $405,712 in cash at closing; and (ii) JFK Cartage entered into a $696,935 promissory note with the JFK Cartage Seller, $98,448 of which was payable weekly, in the amount of 25% of accounts receivable collected, but in any event, no later than October 4, 2022, with the remaining balance of $598,487, payable in three annual installments of $199,496, with interest at 5.0% percent per annum on July 31, 2023, July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2025, respectively. Additionally, Cougar Express agreed to pay the $503,065 Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loan that existed on the books of JFK Cartage, which was paid in August 2022; and (iv) agreed to pay certain accrued liabilities and other notes payable that existed on the books of JFK Cartage. For accounting purposes, the total purchase consideration paid, after closing adjustments, was deemed to be $1,102,647, which includes cash of $405,712 plus the $696,935 promissory note that is in the name of JFK Cartage. The purchase consideration amount did not include the SBA loan of $503,065, and accrued liabilities and other notes payable, which were treated as assumed liabilities in the purchase price allocation.
 
Effective September 16, 2022, the Company’s newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, TLSS-FC, closed on an acquisition of all outstanding stock of Freight Connections, a company offering an array of transportation, warehousing, consolidating, distribution, and local cartage services throughout the New York tri-state area. Joseph Corbisiero, the sole shareholder of Freight Connections, from whom the shares were acquired (the “Freight Connections Seller”), is an unrelated party. Freight Connections was founded in 2016 and is a transportation and logistics carrier headquartered in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey. Freight Connections currently operates with 30 power units and 50 trailers, including dry vans, pups, flatbeds, step decks, and double drop trailers, out of three buildings in the area with 200,000 square feet of warehouse and cross dock space, strategically located within one mile of each other. Freight Connections offers customers an array of services including truckload, LTL, and consolidating of cartage, construction-trade, air, and rail freight, as well as warehousing and distribution services. Prior to the closing, the Company, TLSSA and Freight Connections Seller entered into an amendment to their Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of May 23, 2022 (the “Amended SPA”), and TLSS Acquisition assigned its interest in the Amended SPA to TLSS-FC. Pursuant to the Amended SPA, the total purchase price was $9,365,000, subject to certain adjustment. TLSS-FC: (i) paid $1,525,000 in cash at closing, (ii) Freight Connections entered into a $4,544,671 secured promissory note with the Freight Connections Seller, with interest accruing at the rate of 5% per annum and then 10% per annum as of March 1, 2023 (The entire unpaid principal under the note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts payable thereunder, shall be due and payable in one balloon payment on December 31, 2023, unless paid sooner. The promissory note is secured solely by the assets of Freight Connections), and (iii) assumed certain debt. The Company issued to the Freight Connections Seller 178,911,844 shares of the Company’s common stock and 32,374 shares of the Company’s Series H preferred stock, which is convertible into an aggregate of 323,740,000 shares of the Company’s common stock based on a conversion of 10,000 shares of common stock for each share of Series H preferred stock outstanding. The common stock and the as if converted number of Series H preferred stock were valued at $0.0059 per share based on the quoted closing price of the Company’s common stock on the measurement date, for an aggregate fair value of $2,965,646. The number of shares was calculated as follows: (a) shares of common stock of the Company equal to no more than 4.99% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such issuance, and (b) the balance of the shares in Series H Convertible Preferred Stock, a new series of non-voting, convertible preferred stock issuable to sellers in connection with acquisitions or strategic transactions approved by a majority of the directors of the Company. TLSS-FC agreed to pay certain accrued liabilities and other notes payable that existed on the books of Freight Connections and agreed to pay the $4,544,671 secured promissory note, which was assumed by Freight Connections. For accounting purposes, the total purchase consideration paid, after closing adjustments, was deemed to be $9,035,317, which includes (i) cash paid of $1,525,000, (ii) the aggregate fair value of common shares and Series H preferred shares issued to Freight Connections Seller of $2,965,646, and (iii) the $4,544,671 secured promissory note in the name of Freight Connections. The purchase consideration amount does not include accrued liabilities and other notes payable, which were treated as assumed liabilities in the purchase price allocation.
 
Effective February 3, 2023, our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, TLSS-STI, closed on an acquisition of all outstanding stock of Severance Trucking Co., Inc., Severance Warehousing, Inc. and McGrath Trailer Leasing, Inc., which together offer LTL trucking services throughout New England (collectively, “Severance Trucking”), with an effective date as of the close of business on January 31, 2023. The sellers of the stock of each entity were Kathryn Boyd, Clyde Severance, and Robert Severance, all individuals (the “Sellers”). None of the Sellers is affiliated with the Company or its affiliates. Severance is a privately-owned full-service transportation carrier and logistics business that has been in operation for over 100 years specializing in LTL trucking that provides next day service to major cities in New England and New York, with cartage and interline agreements with respected carriers that ensure reliable deliveries anywhere in the United States and Canada. With annual revenues of over $13.0 million in 2022, Severance currently operates with over 120 power units and trailers and has two locations, comprising approximately 18,000 square feet of warehouse and cross dock space, 9,000 square feet of office and 5,750 square feet of repair facilities located in Dracut, Massachusetts and approximately 16,000 square feet of warehouse space in North Haven, Connecticut. The total purchase price was $2,250,000. TLSS-STI: (i) paid $365,613 in cash at closing and paid closing expenses of $158,700; (ii) assumed and paid off $152,748 in vehicle debt; and (iii) entered into a $1,572,939 secured promissory note with the Sellers, with interest accruing at the rate of 12% per annum. The entire unpaid principal under the note, shall be due and payable in three (3) equal payments on August 1, 2023, February 1, 2024, and August 1, 2024, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder, unless paid sooner. The promissory note is secured solely by the assets of Severance and a corporate guaranty from TLSS. The purchase price is subject to a post-closing adjustment, up or down, determined by the amount by which Severance working capital as of the close of business on January 31, 2023, exceeds or falls short of the target working capital, as of September 30, 2022, on which the purchase price was calculated.
 
One of the Sellers also entered into a consulting agreement, including non-competition and non-solicitation provisions, to continue with Severance after the acquisition for a period of no less than three (3) months and no more than one (1) year.

Consistent with our primary strategy to become a leader in the transportation industry in providing on-time, high-quality pick-up, transportation and delivery services, we expect to accomplish this goal, in part, by pursuing strategic acquisitions as a means of adding new markets in the United States, expanding our transportation and logistics service offerings, adding talented management and operational employees, expanding and upgrading our technology platform and developing operational best practices. Moreover, one factor in assessing acquisition opportunities is the potential for subsequent organic growth post-acquisition.
 
We believe that the acquisitions of Cougar Express, JFK Cartage, Freight Connections, and Severance Trucking fits our current business plan, given their geographic location, services offered, and diversified customer base, and given that they would provide us with long-standing, well-run operations.
 
Competition
 
The transportation services industry is highly competitive and composed of fragmented marketplaces, with multiple companies competing in the geographic region in which we provide services. We compete on service, reliability, scope and scale of operations, technological capabilities, and price. Our competitors include local, regional, and national companies that offer the same services we provide — some with larger customer bases, significantly more resources and more experience than we have. Additionally, some of our customers have internal resources that can perform services we offer. Due in part to the fragmented nature of the industry, we must strive daily to retain existing business relationships and forge new relationships.
 
The health of the transportation industry will continue to be a function of domestic economic growth, particularly in the e-commerce marketplace. We believe that we have positioned the Company to grow with and benefit from the e-commerce expansion. Together with our scale, technology, and company-specific initiatives, we believe that our positioning should keep us growing faster than the macro environment.
 
Seasonality
 
All of our revenues are subject to seasonal variations which are common in the trucking industry. Generally, most of the first quarter and the latter part of the fourth quarter are the seasonally weakest while the second and third quarters are the seasonally strongest, as customers tend to reduce shipments prior to and after the winter holiday season.
Economic Factors
 
Our business is subject to a number of general economic factors that may have a material effect on the results of our operations, many of which are largely out of our control. These include supply chain interruptions, the impact of recessionary economic cycles, as well as downturns in our customers’ business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries, such as retail and manufacturing, where we have a significant concentration of customers. Economic conditions may materially affect our customers’ business levels, the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services. We operate in a highly price-sensitive and competitive industry, making industry pricing actions, quality of customer service, effective asset utilization and cost control major competitive factors.
Regulation
 
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies. These regulations impact us directly and indirectly by regulating third-party transportation providers we use to transport freight for our customers.
 
Regulation Affecting Motor Carriers, Owner-Operators and Transportation Brokers. In the United States, our subsidiaries that operate as motor carriers have motor carrier licenses issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). In addition, our subsidiaries acting as property brokers have property broker licenses issued by the FMCSA. Our motor carrier subsidiaries and the third-party motor carriers must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those related to drug-testing, alcohol-testing, hours-of-service, records retention, vehicle inspection, driver qualification and minimum insurance requirements. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to emissions, drivers’ hours-of-service, independent contractor eligibility requirements, onboard reporting of operations, air cargo security and other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), also regulate our equipment, operations and independent contractor drivers. Like our third-party support carriers, we are subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements in certain states and local jurisdictions where we operate. In foreign jurisdictions where we operate, our operations are regulated by the appropriate governmental authorities.
 
In 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance Safety Accountability program (“CSA”), which uses a Safety Management System (“SMS”) to rank motor carriers on seven categories of safety-related data, known as Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories, or “BASICs.”
 
Although the CSA scores are not currently publicly available, we believe such scores will be made public in the future. Our fleet could be ranked worse or better than our competitors, and the safety ratings of our motor carrier operations could be impacted. Our network of third-party transportation providers may experience a similar result. A reduction in safety and fitness ratings may result in difficulty attracting and retaining qualified independent contractors and could cause our customers to direct their business away from the Company and to carriers with more favorable CSA scores, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
 
Classification of Independent Contractors. Tax and other federal and state regulatory authorities, as well as private litigants, continue to assert that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements and heighten the penalties for companies who misclassify workers and are found to have violated overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers that meet certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a longstanding, recognized practice. Federal legislators also sought to expand the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover “non-employees” who perform labor or services for businesses, even if said non-employees are properly classified as independent contractors; require taxpayers to provide written notice to workers based upon their classification as either an employee or a non-employee; and impose penalties and fines for violations of the notice requirement and/or for misclassifications. Some states have launched initiatives to increase revenues from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation and income taxes, and the reclassification of independent contractors as employees could help states with those initiatives. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determinations of independent contractor status. If our independent contractor drivers are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under some or all the following: federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, and labor, employment, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.

Environmental Regulations. Our facilities and operations and our independent contractors are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, emissions from vehicles, engine-idling, fuel tanks and related fuel spillage and seepage, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters that involve inherent environmental risks. Similar laws and regulations may apply in many of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We may be responsible for the cleanup of any spill or other incident involving hazardous materials caused by our operations or business. In the past, we have been responsible for the costs of cleanup of diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events, and none of these incidents materially affected our business or operations. We generally transport only hazardous materials rated as low-to-medium-risk, and a small percentage of our total shipments contain hazardous materials. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations, and we do not know of any existing environmental condition that reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. Future changes in environmental regulations or liabilities from newly discovered environmental conditions or violations (and any associated fines and penalties) could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. U.S. federal and state governments, as well as governments in certain foreign jurisdictions where we operate, have also proposed environmental legislation that could, among other things, potentially limit carbon, exhaust and greenhouse gas emissions. If enacted, such legislation could result in higher costs for new tractors and trailers, reduced productivity and efficiency, and increased operating expenses, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
