Item 1. Business. 
Our Company
We are an advertising technology company. Our cloud-based demand side platform ("DSP"), Adelphic, enables the programmatic purchase of advertising, which is the electronification of the digital advertising buying process. Programmatic advertising is rapidly taking market share from traditional ad sales channels, which require more staffing, offer less transparency, and involve higher costs to buyers.
Adelphic is used by marketers and their advertising agencies to centralize the planning, buying and measurement of their digital advertising across most channels. Through our omni-channel platform, a marketer can easily buy ads on desktop, mobile, connected TV, linear TV, in-game, streaming audio and digital billboards.
Adelphic is an easy-to-use self-service platform that provides our customers with transparency and control over their advertising campaigns. Our platform offers customers unique visibility across a variety of inventory, allowing them to create customized audience segments and leverage our people-based and strategic partner data to reach target audiences at scale. Our platform delivers a full suite of forecasting, reporting and built-in automation that provides our customers with insights into available inventory based on the desired target audience. We offer advanced forecasting and reporting that empowers our customers with functionality designed to ensure they can accurately measure and improve their return-on-advertising spend (“ROAS”) across channels.
Marketers use our platform to deliver advertising campaigns to their desired target audience across channels and formats. Through platform integrations, we offer our customers access to omnichannel advertising inventory, which refers to media available across devices, channels and formats. This includes access to approximately 300 million unique desktop and mobile users, approximately 115 million connected TV households, approximately 112 million linear TV households, over 200 million unique digital audio users, and approximately 158,000 unique digital billboards in the United States. Our platform supports a full range of transaction types including real-time bidding, private marketplace and programmatic guaranteed, allowing customers to easily source and integrate ad inventory directly from publishers and private marketplaces.
We enable deep data access through our data integrations to authenticate user identities across a range of devices. Our matching of people-based identifiers enables us to be the nexus point with more than 70 data partners, providing customers with deep access to people-based data across market verticals such as automotive, entertainment, professional services, retail, consumer packaged goods, travel and tourism, and healthcare. Our proprietary identity graph has linked approximately 115 million households to an estimated 1 billion connected devices and is combined with access to approximately 280,000 audience attributes in the United States, which we believe makes it one of the largest in the industry.
Our customers are advertising buyers including large advertising holding companies, independent advertising agencies, mid-market advertising service organizations as well as marketers that rely on our self-service platform for their programmatic ad buying needs. We are a trusted partner to our customers and have had a customer satisfaction rating of 90% or greater for the last four years based on Viant’s Annual Adelphic Customer Satisfaction Survey. Many of our customers use us as their primary DSP.
Our platform is built on people-based data. Using our identity resolution capabilities and identity graph, marketers and their advertising agencies can identify targeted consumers using real-world identifiers rather than relying primarily on cookies to track users. We believe the industry is shifting to a people-based framework to replace cookies in delivering personalized advertising, particularly for identification. People-based data allows marketers to deliver personalized advertising while being able to accurately link ad impressions across multiple devices and to customer sales and measure the impact of their ad spend. In addition, people-based data can offer greater transparency to consumers with respect to who is collecting their data and what it is being used for and can offer more robust choices to delete or stop use of their data for personalized advertising. Many of our competitors rely on cookies for the targeting and measurement of digital advertising but this technology has not been effective at accurately measuring the real impact of a marketer’s ad spend on their business results. Apple’s web browser, Safari, and other web browsers currently do not allow third-party cookies. Google has announced plans to start phasing out (and eventually entirely disallowing) third-party cookies in their Chrome browser in 2024. Moreover, certain state data privacy laws, including in California and Colorado, require websites and apps to enable consumers to opt-out of the transfer of their personal information used for digital advertising, which could further undermine cookie-based tracking and targeted marketing. This market change has created an increase in demand by marketers actively looking for platforms like ours that offer an alternative to cookie-based tracking, which we believe is strengthening our strategic position.
Programmatic advertising has proven its value to marketers and an increasing number of organizations are devoting more of their digital ad spend to it. The digital ecosystem continues to evolve and with it, programmatic advertising, creating new opportunities and needs for marketers and their agencies. The U.S. programmatic advertising market is expected to grow from $114.7 billion in 2021 to $168.0 billion in 2024, a 14% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”), according to eMarketer, a market research company that provides insights and trends related to digital marketing, media and commerce. We focus on ad buyers and believe that our 
solutions will accelerate the shift of advertising budgets to programmatic advertising. Additionally, as marketers desire more control over programmatic advertising and move some functions of programmatic ad buying in-house, our platform is designed to address these needs and expand our market opportunity.
Our total revenue was $197.2 million, $224.1 million and $165.3 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing a decrease of 12.0% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 and an increase of 35.6% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. We recorded net losses of $48.1 million and $37.6 million and net income of $20.6 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $(6.1) million, $37.1 million, and $31.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). For a definition of adjusted EBITDA, an explanation of our management’s use of this measure and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to our net income or net loss, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operating and Financial Performance Measures—Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
Our Industry
We believe the key industry trends shaping the advertising market include:
Advertising dollars shifting toward programmatic advertising: We believe the advertising industry is still in the early stages of a shift toward programmatic advertising. The ability to transact through real-time-bidding platforms has evolved beyond banner advertising to be used across a wide range of advertising channels and formats, including desktop, mobile, connected TV, linear TV, in-game, streaming audio and digital billboards. U.S. programmatic advertising is experiencing a rapid increase in adoption and, according to eMarketer, is expected to grow at a 14% CAGR from 2021 to 2024, reaching $148.8 billion in 2023 and $168.0 billion by 2024. U.S. programmatic advertising is forecasted to represent 41% of total U.S. media spend by 2024, increasing from 38% in 2021. The TV industry is undergoing significant disruptions as internet-enabled connected TV has become a preferred vehicle for streaming video content. The amount of connected TV users in the U.S. is forecasted to increase from approximately 218 million, or 65% of the U.S. population, in 2021 to approximately 242 million, or 70% of the U.S. population, in 2026, according to eMarketer. Connected TV also provides a number of benefits to advertisers, including more accurate control of scale, addressability and measurement. Marketers are increasingly investing in connected TV as more inventory becomes available. According to eMarketer, 80% of connected TV ad spend was transacted programmatically in 2021 and the share of programmatic is expected to increase to nearly 91% in 2024. In addition, connected TV ad spend is expected to grow from $17.2 billion in 2021 to $43.6 billion in 2026, a 20% CAGR.
Strong marketer demand for ROAS measurement across all channels: Marketers are looking for a centralized view of their customers, while connecting online and offline purchases to accurately measure ROAS. ROAS is a critical metric for marketing campaigns. Insights from ROAS across all campaigns inform marketers about what they are getting for their money across all media investments near real-time. Hence, marketers seek tools to track their ROAS across all channels. We believe people-based platforms are able to provide a more accurate measurement of ROAS as compared to cookie-based platforms.
Demand for scaled people-based platforms: Advertising has become more data driven and marketers need to be able to target audiences at the individual and household level while respecting consumer privacy. Internet advertisers in the past have capitalized on anonymous data from cookies to gain insights into users and ad performance. However, increased privacy concerns and changing requirements of browser providers including Google (Chrome) and Apple (Safari) are causing marketers to reduce their reliance on vendors and platforms that primarily utilize cookies for device identification. In today’s connected world, marketers need to be able to identify their customers and connect with them across most channels, devices and formats. This, we believe, will drive an industry shift away from cookie-based DSPs to scaled people-based DSPs.
Brands directly selecting advertising platform solutions: Marketers are increasingly becoming directly involved in the selection of their advertising platform solutions as they seek to reduce costs, better leverage their customer data and gain more control over their advertising. These factors have also led to an increase in marketers moving programmatic ad buying functions in-house. The automation of ad-buying technology has enabled fast, accurate and cost-effective decision-making, resulting in ad buying becoming a skillset that an increasing number of chief marketing officers want to fully own. According to the most recent survey by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an advertising business organization that develops industry standards, conducts research, and provides legal support for the online advertising industry, in 2019, 18% of U.S. brands had completely moved programmatic ad buying in-house, and 51% of U.S. brands had moved a portion of their programmatic ad buying in-house.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe that over the long term, our total addressable market is the total global advertising market, which eMarketer has forecasted to grow from $930 billion in 2023 to $1.15 trillion in 2026, a 7% CAGR. Currently, our focus is primarily on the U.S. 
market, which eMarketer has forecasted to grow from $344 billion in 2023 to $452 billion in 2026 in the United States, a 9% CAGR, broken into the following segments:
•Desktop and Mobile: U.S. desktop and mobile advertising are forecasted to grow from a $245 billion market in 2023 to a $333 billion market in 2026, an 11% CAGR.
•Connected TV: U.S. connected TV advertising is forecasted to be a $27 billion market in 2023 and forecasted to grow to $44 billion in 2026, a 17% CAGR. Connected TV includes over-the-top (“OTT”) content delivered through a connected device over the internet.
•Linear TV: U.S. linear TV advertising is forecasted to be a $62.4 billion market in 2023 and forecasted to be a $62.1 billion market in 2026, a negative 0.2% CAGR.
•Streaming Audio: U.S. digital audio advertising is forecasted to be a $7 billion market in 2023 and forecasted to grow to $9 billion in 2026, a 9% CAGR.
•Digital Billboards: U.S. billboard advertising is forecasted to be a $3 billion market in 2023 and forecasted to grow to $4 billion in 2026, a 10% CAGR.
The forecasts for each segment above include both programmatic and non-programmatic digital advertising. In recent years, programmatic advertising has represented an increasing portion of total U.S. media spend. eMarketer estimates that the U.S. programmatic advertising market, as represented by the segments above, will grow from $115 billion in 2021 to $168 billion in 2024, a 14% CAGR.
Our Solution
We make it easy to buy an ad across a wide range of advertising channels and formats, and help brands measure the impact of their ad spend by providing electronic buying and measurement of all advertising. Our platform enables marketers and their advertising agencies to plan, buy and measure campaigns across channels. Integrated with our people-based capabilities, we provide our customers with a full suite of forecasting, reporting and automation functionality to make informed decisions around their advertising investments. We provide superior customer service to ensure our customers have the level of support required for their unique business needs. Viant is driven to be a leader in innovation, automation, transparency, customer focus and responsible media.
Holistic, Omnichannel DSP:  Marketers and their agencies can use our integrated platform to efficiently manage omnichannel campaigns and access metrics from each channel to inform decisions in other channels. Our integrations enable the purchase of advertising media across desktop, mobile, connected TV, linear TV, in-game, streaming audio and digital billboards. Our technology leverages artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning to identify the best supply partners, formats and impressions based on our customers’ goals.
Viant Household ID™ (“VHHID”): Our proprietary people-based innovation that combines digital and personal identifiers into a normalized household profile that provides known customer data insights and optimized bid decisions for target audiences, accurate reach and frequency management across omnichannel supply including cookieless channels like CTV, Safari and mobile app and holistic measurement of conversions across all devices and context. Whether online or in-store, we can attribute conversions to media investments. The VHHID not only captures the ad exposure as the impression is delivered, but can also connect that ad exposure to an outcome which significantly differentiates our DSP technology.
World Without Cookies Release/People-Based Advertising: Released in 2021, our World Without Cookies feature integrates a people-based, household approach directly into the Adelphic DSP. By unifying the VHHID throughout Adelphic, World Without Cookies empowers marketers to manage reach and frequency at the household level, reducing waste and improving the customer experience. In a recent study, marketers using our World Without Cookies feature saw over 200% more conversions and reached 40% more households compared to traditional cookie-based platforms, and decreased frequency by 28%.
Viant Identity Graph: Our proprietary, established identity resolution capabilities power our identity graph, which reduces or eliminates the need for cookies by enabling matching of people-based identifiers that anchor digital identifiers and allow marketers to reach targeted consumers in a privacy-conscious manner, irrespective of device or channel. Our proprietary identity graph has linked approximately 115 million U.S. households to approximately 1 billion connected devices. This process provides access to an estimated 280,000 audience attributes using our proprietary people-based, household profile, the VHHID, allowing marketers to reach real consumers, not proxies, whether they are at home or away. The VHHID provides known insights for optimized bid decisions and touchpoint collection across consumer pathways for holistic targeting and measurement across channels.
Advanced Reporting and Measurement: We invest heavily in our measurement capabilities, as we believe advertising should be driving a positive return. Our self-service campaign analysis and data intelligence tool empowers customers with differentiated insights, including conversion lift, multi-touch attribution, foot-traffic data reports, digital-out-of-home lift, sales reporting and ROAS analytics. Leveraging our people-based framework and machine learning algorithms, our platform provides marketers real-time 
actionable insights throughout an advertising campaign. Our built-in automation enables marketers to optimize digital campaigns designed to achieve their key performance indicator (“KPI”) goals.
Onboarding: We enable marketers to safely and securely onboard their first-party data to gain a view into their customers’ top attributes, create targeting segments and easily activate and measure these customer segments. Our simple interface allows marketers to upload audience data with ease and create a unique segment or build lookalike audiences without the need for a separate data management platform. Our data integrations provide marketers with high match rates, which provides scalable and meaningful audience insights for segmentation, targeting and measuring key outcomes both online and offline.
Flexible Customer Engagement Models: Our DSP and related services are available through several levels of best-in-class customer service, from a self-service interface, providing customers with transparency and control over their advertising campaigns and underlying data infrastructure, to a fully managed end-to-end solution, providing an experienced support team for audiences, execution and advanced reporting. 
Our Strengths
We believe the following attributes and capabilities provide us with long-term competitive advantages:
•Scalable Self-Service Platform: We offer a self-service platform that enables customers to operate their ad campaigns without extensive involvement of our staff. This dynamic allows us to add new customers and allows customers to scale their spend on our platform in a manner that grows our revenue faster than the growth of our personnel costs.
•Centralized Platform: We believe our DSP and related services enable our customers to plan, buy and measure advertising across more channels than our competitors and to centralize the purchase of each type of programmatic media on a single platform. Our supply integrations provide customers with access to approximately 300 million unique desktop and mobile users, approximately 115 million connected TV households, 112 million linear TV households, over 200 million unique digital audio users, and approximately 158,000 unique digital billboards, in the United States.
•Proprietary Technology: We leverage a robust suite of proprietary tools and products to enable our customers to utilize our platform and services.

As new offerings are developed, we continue to file and obtain patents on the most valuable and innovative products developed at our Company.
•Machine Learning Capabilities: We enable the use of machine learning, workflow automation, automated reporting and other functionalities that allow our customers to update and make thousands of changes automatically to help achieve their desired business outcomes. We believe these capabilities make our customers’ lives easier and improve the performance of their campaigns.
•Advanced Reporting and Measurement: We invest heavily in our measurement capabilities, as we believe this will increase our customers’ usage of our DSP and related services. Our platform measures ROAS across all channels and empowers our customers with real-time insights leveraging people-based data, including foot-traffic reports and multi-touch attribution analytics. Our advanced reporting functionality uses our identity graph that has linked approximately 115 million households to an estimated 1 billion connected devices and is combined with access to approximately 280,000 audience attributes in the United States to provide marketers with a holistic view of measurement across all channels.
•Differentiated People-Based Capabilities: Our platform leverages a people-based framework. We integrate with over 70 data partners using people-based identifiers. We believe this allows for a much more effective and privacy-friendly approach to advertising than using cookies for identification. Our DSP and related services are built on a foundation of user consent with advanced consumer opt-out capabilities to keep privacy and security on the forefront.
•Experienced Management Team: Our management team has deep and extensive experience in the advertising technology sector, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. The experience of our management team has allowed us to continue to be innovative in developing solutions for our customers.
•Business Model: Because we are a self-service platform, as we add new customers and as customers increase the use of our platform, we are able to demonstrate strong operating leverage. 
Our Growth Strategy

•Continue to invest in our customers’ success: Our platform provides extensive functionality designed to provide our customers with a high level of control and enable them to run efficient ad campaigns. We continue to enhance new customer onboarding and support while investing in training and education for customers to maximize their success with our platform.
•Add new customers and increase our customers’ usage of our platform: We continue to add functionality to our platform to attract new customers and encourage our customers to increase their usage of our platform. We believe many advertisers are in the early stages of moving a greater percentage of their advertising budgets to programmatic channels. By providing solutions for the planning, buying and measuring of their media spend across all channels, we believe we are well positioned to capture the increase in programmatic budgets from new and existing customers.
•Continue to strengthen our omnichannel partnerships: We believe we have one of, if not the largest breadth of advertising inventory across channels in our industry landscape. We will continue to invest in the integration of new supply partners across all channels, further broadening and deepening our supply of advertising inventory.
•Expand our sales and marketing investment: We intend to continue to expand sales and marketing efforts to increase awareness and consideration of our platform and promote the advantages of our people-based framework as cookie-based options continue to decline.
•Extend our leadership position in people-based advertising: We believe there is significant value in continuing to invest in enhancing our identity resolution capabilities through additional people-based data integrations.
•Invest in growth through acquisitions: We also intend to invest in acquisitions that will allow us to offer new products and capitalize on our large and growing market opportunity. To the extent we find attractive acquisition candidates and business opportunities in the future, we may continue to acquire complementary businesses, products and technologies.
Our Platform
Viant's DSP, Adelphic, enables a marketer or their agency to programmatically buy an ad in linear television, a digital billboard on the side of the highway, a streaming ad on connected TVs, an ad in a mobile application, creatively within gameplay, during a 
podcast or other streaming audio, or a dynamically personalized ad on any website, all within a single user interface. As illustrated by the graphic above, we believe that our platform sits at the center of the digital advertising ecosystem. 
The key components of our platform include: 
•Interoperable DSP. Our holistic, omnichannel DSP enables brands and agencies to seamlessly target and measure key audiences across leading supply from premium publishers within connected TV ("CTV"), digital out-of-home, mobile, audio, in-game, desktop and more without having to constantly switch between platforms.
•Comprehensive Forecasting. Our platform allows customers to plan future marketing campaigns based on desired targeting tactics by utilizing historical bid request data to project performance onto available inventory. Customers can easily apply multiple data segmentation filters and see what ad inventory is available and at what price.
•Ease of Use. Our intuitive user interface enables marketers to seamlessly move from forecasting to launching live advertising campaigns. This reduces the time from planning a campaign to execution, helping marketers to fluidly execute deterministic cross-channel campaigns using a variety of quality data and supply partners to reach their target audience.
•Campaign Decisioning. We offer the ability to continuously measure and optimize campaigns by leveraging powerful KPIs directly within platform reports. Marketers have the ability to optimize campaigns in-flight, even if they have already started. This granular decision-making ability provides customers more accurate and real-time understanding over the performance of their live campaigns.
Viant Household ID: The Adelphic platform has exclusive access to the VHHID, making it a people-based DSP, already operating in cookieless environments including CTV and mobile applications. The VHHID powers data, channel and publisher interoperability providing simple and effective advertising. Marketers can easily sync customer data, build custom audiences, extend target audiences and understand audience insights seamlessly within our platform.
•Cookieless Solution. The VHHID provides marketers the scalability, addressability, measurability and privacy compliance for success today. This patented technology unlocks many benefits such as: 
•built-in cross-device conversion tracking, allowing marketers to target all eligible devices in a household to drive conversions;
•universal frequency management at scale, eliminating the need to control frequency in silos based on channel and/or device limitations; and
•tracking uniformity and identity persistence across all browsers and tracking environments with otherwise fragmented identifiers.
•Onboarding. Through our simple interface, marketers can upload and leverage their first-party data using the VHHID. This enables marketers to onboard their first-party data and instantly gain a view into their customers’ top attributes, create targeting segments and easily activate and measure these customer segments across cookieless environments.
•Lookalike Modeling. We help expand the reach of an existing audience segment or prospect list for new customers for extended scale of critical audiences.
•People-Based Targeting and Data Integrations. Viant’s people-based approach allows brands to connect with real households and individuals with accurate reach and frequency. Our integrations with more than 70 data providers allow for extensive audience data mapping, giving users the ability to target consumers based on purchase behaviors, location, TV viewership insights and much more. Superior integrations with TV viewership data providers present users with one of the most established, scaled and accurate CTV footprints in the market.
Advanced Reporting: We close the loop on digital and traditional media by linking advertising spend to online and offline sales.
•Reach and Frequency. Our platform accurately measures how many households and unique users an advertising campaign reached and the frequency of exposures.
•Cross-Channel Reporting. Our cross-channel reporting capabilities equip customers to analyze cross-device and cross-channel campaign impact on sales and other KPIs. 
•TV vs Digital Reporting. Our TV vs digital reporting provides insights into the impact connected and linear television advertising has on driving digital engagement like website visits or conversions, as well as offline sales. These insights create better visibility into the true ROAS of TV ad campaigns.
•Multi-Touch Attribution. Our multi-touch attribution provides customers the ability to receive insights into where target audiences are interacting with brands, the impact of touchpoints across channels and devices and the order of steps along the conversion journey. The resulting holistic view of ad performance enables customers to close the loop on measurement and better link spend to sales.
•Conversion Lift. Our conversion lift reporting helps advertisers understand the impact of media in driving conversions. Ghost bids are a control group made up of consumers who were within the campaign targeting criteria and active on the programmatic network, on whom a bid request was placed to show them the campaign ad, but the bid was lost. Those impressions are then passively tracked and included in the control group. By leveraging ghost bids to create a control group, customers can see how much impact their media has in driving incremental conversions and use these insights to refine their optimization strategy for better results and investment impact.
•Foot Traffic Attribution. Our foot traffic data reporting capabilities allow customers to analyze the impact of their ad campaigns on driving visits to a physical location.
•Digital Billboard Reporting. Our digital billboard reporting provides a holistic view of ad spend, giving customers real-time insights into their digital billboard ad performance and helping customers optimize budgets by allocating ad spend on effective digital billboards and venue types.
Our platform is built with ad buyers in mind and offers many in-depth features that give buyers the highest levels of control, which helps ensure they are running the most efficient campaigns possible. This includes:
•Bulk Functionality: Our platform is built to ease the lives of programmatic traders. With Adelphic, traders can mass edit ad orders and campaigns, instead of making individual changes one at a time, saving significant time. For example, if a trader wants to change the bid price for all 1,000 of their ad orders, they could simply download, complete and upload a form, rather than wasting time by editing each ad order one by one.
•Application Integration Interfaces (“API”) Capabilities: Adelphic provides ease of integration using APIs and tools. The API capabilities provide bilateral data syndication into or out of the platform for trafficking and reporting in formats easily accepted by business intelligence teams for programmatic traders. With these, traders can maintain customer identities with a fully integrated platform that links devices and offline activities to real people and seamlessly execute and measure campaigns.
•Machine Learning Algorithms: Our built-in advanced machine learning technology analyzes millions of impressions and data points every second. Our algorithms find optimal bid prices for maximizing performance and scale across all major KPIs, allowing our customers to strengthen their campaign efforts and build confidence in programmatic campaign performance.
Our Technology and Development
Rapid and continuing innovation is a core driver of our business success and our corporate culture. Our product and engineering team is responsible for the design, development and testing of our platform. We are committed to continuous innovation and rapid introduction of new technologies, features and functionality that bring value to our customers. We expect technology and development expense and capitalized software development costs to increase as we continue to invest in the development of our platform to support additional features and functions, such as enhancement of our user interface and automation functions, and to increase the number of advertising and data inventory integrations in various channels.
The technical infrastructure for our platform is currently managed through third-party web hosting services providers. We generally enter into one- to three-year agreements with our web hosting providers.
Our Customers
Our customers consist of purchasers of programmatic advertising inventory. We define an active customer as a customer that had total aggregate contribution ex-TAC of at least $5,000 through our platform during the previous twelve months. We had 326 and 309 active customers for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in each case consisting of advertising buyers, including large advertising holding companies, independent advertising agencies, mid-market advertising service organizations as well as marketers relying on our self-service platform for their programmatic ad buying needs. For a detailed discussion of active customers, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Key Operating and Financial Performance Measures—Active Customers and Average Contribution ex-TAC per Active Customer.” Contribution ex-TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a detailed discussion of our key operating and financial performance measures and a reconciliation of contribution ex-TAC to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Key Operating and Financial Performance Measures—Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
Many of the advertising agencies that we work with are owned by holding companies, where decision-making is generally highly decentralized such that purchasing decisions are made, and relationships with advertisers are located, at the agency, local branch or division level. Our customer count includes only those parties with which we have a billing relationship. We contract with our customers either through master service agreements or insertion orders. Our agreements do not contain any material commitments on behalf of customers to use our platform to purchase ad inventory or use other features. Our agreements with customers generally do not have a specified term and are generally terminable at any time by either party upon specified notice periods, typically ranging from 30 to 90 days. Insertion orders are generally limited in scope and can be reduced or canceled by a buyer without penalty. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We receive a significant amount of revenue from a select number of advertising agency holding companies, owning various advertising agencies, and the loss of advertising agencies as customers could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.” for additional discussion of our customer relationships with advertising agencies.
Our Advertising and Data Supply
We obtain digital advertising inventory primarily through our integrations with supply side platforms and directly with publishers. We believe that our integrations across every channel give us one of the most robust omnichannel integrations of any single platform. These suppliers provide us with access to a breadth of programmatic advertising inventory across desktop, mobile, connected TV, linear TV, in-game, streaming audio and digital billboards.
We enable deep data access through our integrations with over 70 leading data companies, giving our customers access to data across key industry verticals, including retail, consumer packaged goods, travel and healthcare. Customers onboard their own first-party data onto our platform, without the need of a separate data management platform.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our platform through a direct sales team focused on business development across all markets, including sales to new customers and revenue growth within existing customers. We have an experienced sales team focused on selling access to our platform in our target markets, building and nurturing relationships with global brands and agencies. We use a consultative sales approach focused on educating existing and potential customers on our platform capabilities, and training clients to use our platform. We offer a formal certification program, Programmatic University and Adelphic Certification, which covers programmatic industry trends, technology capabilities and time-saving workflows and have an online knowledge base with robust documentation. We provide dedicated customer support and work with customers as they set up and optimize their campaigns, assist with delivery against KPIs and goals, and provide post-campaign support and recommendations.
We tailor our contracts and terms to the needs of our customers, including by offering our two different pricing options: a percentage of spend option and a fixed cost per mille (“CPM”) option. Customers can use our platform on a self-service basis or can enlist our services to execute their campaigns.
Our marketing efforts are focused on increasing awareness and consideration for our brands, executing thought-leadership initiatives, participating in industry events, creating comprehensive sales support materials generating new customer leads. We seek to accomplish these objectives by presenting at industry conferences, hosting customer conferences, publishing white papers and research, public relations activities, advertising campaigns, and social media presence.
Privacy and Data Protection
In the ordinary course of our business, we may collect, receive, compile, use, store, process, share, dispose of, disclose, retain, transfer, and destroy (“Process”) personal information, as defined under various applicable laws. Accordingly, we are subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy, security, and protection. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act of 2003, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("CPRA"), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), the ePrivacy Directive, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”). In addition, many U.S. states have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both operative in 2023, and similar comprehensive privacy laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the local and federal level. 
The CCPA and CPRA are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal information Processing that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s Processing of personal information and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal information (for example, requests to know of the 
business’s personal information Processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal information, and to opt out of certain personal information disclosures). The CCPA was amended by the CPRA, which went into effect on January 1, 2023. The CPRA expanded the protections provided under the CCPA, including, for example, by giving California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal information, establishing restrictions on personal information retention, expanding the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establishing a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the law. U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws also require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal information and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal information. A failure to comply with applicable privacy laws may lead to the defense of costly regulatory actions. For example, the CCPA provides for civil penalties ranging from $2,500 - $7,500 per violation (with increased material risk where numerous violations have occurred on a large scale), and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages.
Foreign data privacy and security laws impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. For example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and to companies established outside the EEA that Process personal information in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal information Processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal information Processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal information; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal information; mandating notice of certain personal information breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances.
See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Data Privacy" for additional information about the laws, obligations and limitation to which we are subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws, obligations and limitations.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with large, privately-held companies, such as Yahoo DSP, along with public companies such as The Trade Desk, and with divisions of large, well-established companies such as Google and Amazon. The competitive landscape in recent years has been affected by consolidation and limited investment in new startups in our industry and there are few competitors with self-service capabilities. Our long history and time in the market with customers has given us significant advantages in terms of platform development and expertise, as well as a long development lead ahead of new entrants. We believe that we compete primarily based on the performance of campaigns running on our platform, capabilities of our platform, our identity resolution capabilities, our omnichannel capabilities and our advance reporting capabilities. We believe that we are differentiated from our competitors in the following areas:
•we are an independent technology company focused on serving advertising agencies and marketers on the buy-side of our industry;
•our platform is self-service and easy to use;
•we offer our DSP in an integrated manner with our people-based capabilities, so customers do not need to use separate providers for onboarding client information and ad and data purchasing services;
•our platform provides comprehensive access to a wide range of inventory types across a broad range of channels;
•our platform provides comprehensive access to a wide range of data partners across a broad range of industry verticals and channels to enable precise audience targeting and measurement;
•our identity resolution capabilities help marketers plan, buy and measure their campaigns more effectively;
•we provide extensive customer service and satisfaction; and
•we provide flexible pricing options to support our customer’s needs.
Our Human Capital
We are a founder-led business and believe our employees and culture are key to our success. Our business and our culture are anchored on four core values that embody our resourceful mentality: “Live,” “Lead,” “Create” and “Figure It Out.” We believe we attract talented employees to our company and sophisticated customers to our platform in large part because of our vision and unwavering commitment to using cutting-edge technologies to create products that help advance the advertising industry.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 308 employees in 11 offices across the United States. Our team draws from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and experiences across technology and advertising industries.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to fostering a culture of inclusion where all employees feel valued and included. We believe our greatest asset is the people who work for us, and as part of our investment in our people, we prioritize diversity and inclusion. Our goal is to create a culture where we value, respect, and provide fair treatment and opportunities for all employees. Each year, we conduct an annual survey to give employees the opportunity to provide feedback on our management team and culture. This survey helps drive new programs that continue the development of our inclusive culture. Our leaders review the survey feedback and work with their teams to initiate new initiatives based on the results.
We are committed to developing a diverse environment through recruiting, development programs, community involvement and fostering conversations about differences. 
Talent Development
Even though we have been around for over 20 years, our culture still reflects an entrepreneurial spirit. We empower employees to develop their skills and abilities by following our core values and acting on great ideas regardless of their role or function. We encourage employees at all levels to be creative and come up with ideas that can help the business grow. We work to provide an environment where talented individuals and teams can take control of their career growth. We provide a wide range of learning and development opportunities in both individual and group settings.
Compensation and Benefits
We provide compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees and reward their efforts and contributions. We use internal and external resources to help develop plans that are fair and reward our employees’ commitment and performance with the goal of attracting and retaining high performing individuals. 
In addition to salaries, we provide competitive compensation programs that are in line with our peers and industry. These programs may include bonuses, equity awards, 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave and employee assistance programs among many others. 
Health, Safety and Wellness
We strive to provide a work environment where our employees feel safe and are comfortable working. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we immediately implemented a teleworking program that complied with all applicable government regulations and protected our employees while allowing them to continue to be effective in their jobs. We continue to stay updated on changes in government regulations and implement them to meet our employees’ changing health and wellness needs.
Climate Change and Sustainability
We are launching initiatives that aim to drive sustainability and reduce both our and our partners' environmental impact. We have announced a commitment to be carbon neutral with respect to all known and measurable emissions from our energy usage by the end of 2023 through the purchase of requisite qualified RECs. In addition, to support our partners in reducing their GHG emissions and meeting their goals of carbon neutrality, we launched a customer carbon reduction program on February 7, 2023 called Adtricity. Adtricity aims to deliver RECs to our customers based on their media spend with us. We have also joined Ad Net Zero and the IAB Tech Lab - Sustainability Working Group to drive cross-industry action around sustainability initiatives in the advertising industry.
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws in the United States and abroad, and use contracts, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property. 
As of December 31, 2022, we held 37 issued patents, 11 pending patent applications and 323 issued trademarks. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2025 and 2038. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. In addition to the intellectual property relating to the operation of Viant, Adelphic, and our people-based framework, we own intellectual property related to our owned site, Myspace.com. Of our issued patents, 22 relate to our platform and our people-based framework, and 15 relate to Myspace.com.
Corporate Information
We were founded in 1999 by Tim, Chris and Russ Vanderhook who continue to lead our company today. We have been at the forefront of digital advertising technology since our inception and have demonstrated our ability to grow, thrive, and innovate as competitors have come and gone. In 2011, we acquired the social network website Myspace.com. In 2011, Tim and Chris Vanderhook 
started Xumo, a connected TV streaming service, which was acquired by Comcast Corp. in 2020. In 2015, we completed our first people-based integration. We remained independent until 2016, when Time Inc. acquired a 60% interest in our company through our subsidiary, Viant Technology Holding Inc. (the “Former Holdco”). That interest was later acquired by Meredith Corporation when it acquired Time Inc. in 2018. In 2017, we purchased Adelphic, a DSP. Since the Adelphic acquisition, we have materially transformed from a full-service provider of digital advertising solutions into a leading DSP that enables marketers and their advertising agencies to centralize the planning, buying and measurement of their media investments using a people-based framework. We have grown from a business operating from a home office to a company with approximately 308 employees in 11 offices throughout the United States at the end of 2022. In 2019, we entered into an agreement that resulted in the retirement of the Former Holdco’s interest in our company and Tim Vanderhook, Chris Vanderhook and Capital V LLC (formerly Four Brothers 2 LLC) (the “Vanderhook Parties”) acquired that 60% interest in our company (the “2019 Former Holdco transaction”), allowing it to once again become an independent company. Viant Technology Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on October 9, 2020. In connection with the consummation of our initial public offering (the “IPO”), we became the sole managing member of Viant Technology LLC. We completed the IPO of our Class A common stock on February 12, 2021. Our principal executive offices are located at 2722 Michelson Drive, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92612 and our telephone number is (949) 861-8888. Our website address is www.viantinc.com. Our design logo, “Viant,” and our other registered and common law trade names, trademarks and service marks are the property of Viant Technology Inc.
The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Our Annual Report can be downloaded from the SEC’s website. We will file with or furnish to the SEC periodic reports and other information. We furnish or make available to our stockholders annual reports containing our audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We also furnish or make available to our stockholders quarterly reports containing our unaudited interim financial information, for the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year. We make our periodic reports and other information filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, available, free of charge, through our website, www.viantinc.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports and other information are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”). We may take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including not being required to have our internal control over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these exemptions until December 31, 2026 or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier. We will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such period if certain earlier events occur, including if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, our annual gross revenues exceed $1.235 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period.
In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption is required for private companies. Refer to Note 2—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.
