Fiscal 2019 Business Highlights 
During fiscal 2019, we continued to make progress enhancing and expanding our product and services portfolio and improving product integration, partner integration, and sales delivery to help enterprise customers deploy our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. We also made progress driving market adoption and increasing customer retention of our Consumer Cyber Safety (previously called Consumer Digital Safety) solutions, building on our Norton LifeLock product portfolio. In addition, we implemented operational improvements to reduce costs and complexity, building on the business transformation programs we completed in fiscal 2019, and leveraged synergies from the successful integration of our acquired businesses.

• | Our product development teams built extensive point-to-point integrations across endpoint, network, cloud, and email security products, responding to customer demand to consolidate vendors and enhance their security posture across control points.


• | We further extended our Integrated Cyber Defense (ICD) Platform through application programming interfaces (APIs) and engineering-level integration with more than 120 certified technology partners that have developed or are in the process of developing over 250 integrations of complementary products and services to expand our ecosystem, helping businesses implement a coordinated and robust approach to threat protection, detection, and response that improves security outcomes and drives down cost and complexity.


• | We expanded the marketing of bundled offerings of cyber safety services for consumers through the integration of our Norton-branded security services with LifeLock-branded identity theft protection services, to help individuals and families combat ever-evolving cyberthreats. Bundling these solutions enables us to combine our Norton and LifeLock demand generation and customer relationship management programs to drive new customer acquisition, improve retention, and cross-sell within our large installed base.


• | We launched significant new products to advance our portfolio and competitive position:


◦ | Symantec Advanced EDR Tools and Managed EDR: We introduced Symantec’s Advanced Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools and fully managed EDR (MEDR) service, enabling security teams around the world to stay ahead of threats. EDR improves incident response, threat hunting, and forensics, fortifying teams with investigation expertise and threat intelligence from a world-class team of security operations center analysts. MEDR detects stealthy attacks and examines suspicious activity for faster incident validation and response.


◦ | Cloud Security Portfolio Enhancements: We expanded our cloud security portfolio to help organizations protect cloud applications and related infrastructure. Our ICD Platform offers robust cloud protection, providing visibility and control for virtually any cloud app, and integrations with CloudSOC CASB, Cloud Workload Protection (CWP), and Data Loss Protection (DLP), while enabling customers to track more risk attributes and scan cloud applications and repositories with new API Integrations.


◦ | Data Loss Prevention Enhancements for Office 365: We introduced new features to protect data, whether at rest or in transit, on-premises or in the cloud, and everywhere it flows through a single management console.


◦ | Cloud-based Network Security with Web Isolation: We introduced industry-first Web Isolation technology that integrates into our Web Security Service (WSS) and enables web browsing, nearly eliminating the risk of infection by zero-day malware or advanced threats.


◦ | Cloud-based Network Security with Integrated Endpoint Protection: We introduced improved network-to-endpoint protection with the integration of Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) and SEP Mobile into WSS, allowing web traffic re-directs to WSS for enforcement of network security policies while consequently eliminating the need for a separate agent to manage traffic flow. Our new SD-Cloud Connector enables customers to combine the performance and reliability of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) technology with our

WSS to create a simple, high-performance method to connect branch office locations with our leading cloud security service.

◦ | Targeted Attack Analytics: We expanded our Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) offering to include our targeted attack technology. This feature enables ATP customers to leverage advanced machine learning to automate the discovery of targeted attacks, one of the most dangerous intrusions in corporate networks.


• | Consistent with our strategy of acquiring companies with complementary technology to enhance our products, services, and solutions and speed time to market, we completed several acquisitions during our fiscal year 2019, including the following:


◦ | Appthority. With this acquisition, we are able to provide mobile application security to our Consumer Cyber Safety customers, enabling them to analyze mobile apps for both malicious capabilities and unsafe and unwanted behaviors, such as vulnerabilities, risk of sensitive data loss, and privacy-invasive actions.


◦ | Javelin. This acquisition brings advanced software technology to our Enterprise Security solutions, enabling enterprises to defend against Active Directory-based (AD) attacks through detection of AD misconfigurations and backdoors to help prevent AD reconnaissance and credentials misuse by authorized devices and applications.


◦ | Luminate. With this acquisition, our solutions now incorporate software defined perimeter and zero trust technology enabling us to deliver private secure application access to all users, regardless of device, location, or infrastructure, extending the power of our ICD Platform to users and significantly extending our leadership in cloud security beyond alternative approaches.


• | We expanded our strategic partnerships in our Enterprise Security and Consumer Cyber Safety segments, including:


◦ | Fortinet. We entered into an expansive partnership agreement with Fortinet in an effort to provide customers with comprehensive and robust firewall security solutions. Under this arrangement, we intend to integrate Fortinet’s Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) capabilities into our cloud-delivered WSS and to integrate our endpoint protection solutions into the Fortinet Security Fabric platform. This technology partnership is designed to provide essential security controls across endpoint, network, and cloud environments that are critical to enforcing the zero trust security framework, a model built on the reality that threats everywhere, both inside and outside an organization, require a multi-layered approach to prevention, detection, and response.


◦ | AON. We entered into a strategic partnership with AON, as part of our longer-term strategy to drive consumer adoption through business-to-business-to-consumer relationships. AON offers solutions to help high net worth individuals defend their assets against cyber criminals. The partnership provides that we will offer to AON customers features across our Consumer Cyber Safety solutions. We believe Cyber Safety is synergistic with many brands globally, such as insurers, banks, telecom providers and other organizations. As we expand Cyber Safety internationally and to address a growing array of vertical needs, we believe partnerships such as AON will expand the value we bring customers and the revenue potential for our consumer business.

Intellectual Property
Protective measures
Our intellectual property is an important and vital asset of the company that enables us to develop, market, and sell our products and services and enhance our competitive position. Intellectual property includes our proprietary business and technical know-how, inventions, works of authorship, and confidential information. To protect our intellectual property, we rely primarily upon legal rights in trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, in addition to company policies and procedures, security practices, contracts, and relevant operational measures. 
We protect the confidentiality of proprietary information by entering into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, contractors, and channel and business partners, and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software and proprietary information that include confidentiality terms. These agreements are generally non-transferable and have either a perpetual or time-limited term. We also publish company policies on trade secret protection and employ access controls and associated security measures to protect our facilities, equipment, and networks.
Patents, copyrights, trademarks, and licenses
We maintain an internal patent program with the objective of identifying inventions that provide the basis for new patent applications in areas of importance to our business. We have approximately 2,345 U.S. patents, in addition to foreign patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, which relate to inventive aspects of our products and technology. The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the issuing country. In the U.S., this is typically twenty years from the date of filing of the priority patent application resulting in the patent, which we believe is adequate relative to expected product lifecycles. 
Our products, particularly our software and related documentation, are protected under U.S. and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights. We employ procedures to label copyrightable works with the appropriate proprietary rights notices, and we actively enforce these rights in the U.S. and abroad. However, these measures may not provide adequate protection, and our intellectual property rights may be challenged. 
Symantec, Norton, LifeLock, and associated logos, including the checkmark in a circle logo, are trademarks or registered trademarks of the company in the U.S. and other countries in which we conduct business. In addition, we have used, registered, or applied to register other trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. We actively enforce our trademark, service mark, and trade name rights in the U.S. and abroad based on our rights under common law, and various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, as well as rights under international treaties and conventions. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country. In the U.S., we are generally able to maintain our trademark rights and renew trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use.
In limited cases, we license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on those third parties to protect the licensed rights. This can include open source software which is not subject to proprietary rights protection. While the ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we believe our business is not materially dependent on any individual patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, license, or other intellectual property right.
