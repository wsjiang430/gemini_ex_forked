ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

V.F. Corporation, organized in 1899, is a global leader in the design, production, procurement, marketing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and related products. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “VF,” the "Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” used herein refer to V.F. Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Amounts and percentages for all periods discussed below reflect the results of operations and financial condition from VF’s continuing operations.
VF’s diverse portfolio meets consumer needs across a broad spectrum of activities and lifestyles. Our ability to connect with consumers, as diverse as our brand portfolio, creates a unique platform for sustainable, long-term growth. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on four drivers:

• | Reshape our portfolio. Investing in our brands to realize their full potential, while ensuring the composition of our portfolio positions us to win in evolving market conditions;


• | Transform our model. Becoming consumer- and retail-centric to meet and exceed consumers' needs across all channels, and operate our business differently - from the design studio to the factory floor to the point of sale - by thinking and acting more like a vertical retailer;


• | Elevate direct-to-consumer. Investing in our direct-to-consumer business to make it the pinnacle expression of our brands, and prioritizing serving consumers through e-commerce and digitally enabled transactions; and,


• | Distort Asia. Accelerating our actions in Asia, especially China, to unlock growth opportunities for our brands in this fast-growing region.

VF is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. We own a 


broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, denim, backpack, luggage, accessory and apparel categories. Our largest brands are Vans®, The North Face®, Timberland®, Wrangler® and Lee®. 
Our products are marketed to consumers through our wholesale channel, primarily in specialty stores, department stores, national chains, mass merchants, independently-operated partnership stores and with strategic digital partners. Our products are also marketed to consumers through our own direct-to-consumer operations, which include VF-operated stores, concession retail stores and brand e-commerce sites. Revenues from the direct-to-consumer business represented 33% of VF’s total Fiscal 2019 revenues. In addition to selling directly into international markets, many of our brands also sell products through licensees, agents and distributors. In Fiscal 2019, VF derived 65% of its revenues from the Americas region, 24% from the Europe region and 11% from the Asia-Pacific region.
To provide diversified products across multiple channels of distribution in different geographic areas, we balance our own manufacturing capabilities with sourcing of finished goods from independent contractors. We utilize state-of-the-art technologies for inventory replenishment that enable us to effectively and efficiently get the right assortment of products that match consumer demand.
In light of the recently completed portfolio management actions and organizational realignments, the Company realigned its internal reporting structure in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019 to reflect the organizational changes to better support and assess the operations of the business. The chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based on a global brand view. The new reportable segments for financial reporting purposes have been identified as: Outdoor, Active, Work and Jeans.

We expect continued long-term growth in our Outdoor segment as we focus on product innovation, extend our brands into new product categories, open additional VF-operated stores, grow our e-commerce presence, expand wholesale channel partnerships, develop geographically and acquire additional brands.



ACTIVE SEGMENT

Our Active segment is a group of activity-based lifestyle brands. Product offerings include active apparel, footwear and accessories.
Vans® is the largest brand in our Active segment. The Vans® brand offers performance and casual footwear and apparel targeting younger consumers that sit at the center of action sports, art, music and street fashion.

We expect continued long-term growth in our Active segment as we focus on product innovation, extend our brands into new product categories, open additional VF-operated stores, grow our e-commerce presence, expand wholesale channel partnerships, develop geographically and acquire additional brands.



WORK SEGMENT

Our Work segment consists of work and work-inspired lifestyle apparel and footwear and occupational apparel sold through direct-to-consumer, wholesale and business-to-business ("BTB") channels. 
The Work segment provides uniforms and career occupational apparel for workers in North America and internationally, under the Dickies® and Red Kap® brands (work apparel and footwear), 


the Bulwark® and Workrite® brands (flame resistant and protective apparel primarily for the petrochemical, utility and mining industries), the Timberland PRO® brand (premium work footwear and apparel), the Wrangler® RIGGS brand (work apparel), the VF Solutions® brand (uniform programs for business and governmental organizations), the Walls® brand (outdoor workwear), the Kodiak® brand (work and lifestyle footwear), the Terra® brand (work footwear) and the Horace Small® brand (apparel 


VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 3

for law enforcement and public safety personnel). Products include a wide range of workwear pants, coveralls, shirts, medical scrubs, outerwear, footwear and accessories. Work segment revenues are influenced by the general level of business activity in each market.
Work segment BTB channels include industrial laundries and independent distributors who in turn supply customized workwear to employers for production, service and white-collar personnel. Since industrial laundries and distributors maintain minimal inventories of work clothes, VF’s ability to offer rapid delivery of products in a broad range of sizes is an important advantage in this market. Our commitment to customer service, supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations, enables customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt. The Red Kap®, Bulwark®, Dickies® and Workrite® brands have a strong presence in the reseller distributor market.
The BTB business also develops and manages uniform programs through custom-designed websites for major business customers and governmental organizations. These websites provide the employees of our customers with the convenience of shopping for their work and career apparel via the Internet.


Work segment products are also available on a wholesale basis, including product offerings at mass and specialty retailers, and a direct-to-consumer basis through our e-commerce sites at www.dickies.com, www.timberland.com, www.wrangler.com, www.kodiakboots.com and www.walls.com, and over 65 VF-operated retail stores. The Dickies® brand, with a strong workwear heritage, is a leader in this area with products that address the workers' needs on the job and work-inspired product that allows the worker to stay involved with the brand while in a non-traditional work-setting. The Timberland PRO® and Wrangler® RIGGS brands are also contributors in this area with products that provide comfort, durability and performance. 
We believe there is a strategic opportunity for growth in our Work segment in both existing and future markets and all channels and geographies by introducing innovative products that address workers’ desires for increased comfort and performance, combined with our unique service model and increased presence in the retail workwear market.



JEANS SEGMENT

Our Jeans segment markets denim and related casual apparel products globally.
The Wrangler® (excluding Wrangler® RIGGS) brand offers denim, apparel, accessories and footwear through mass merchants, specialty stores and mid-tier and traditional department stores in the U.S., VF-operated stores and online at www.wrangler.com. Wrangler® westernwear is distributed primarily through western specialty stores, as well as various online retail sites.
Lee® brand products are sold through mid-tier and traditional department stores in the U.S., and online at www.lee.com. The Lee® Riders® brand is marketed to mass merchant and regional discount stores in the U.S. Our Rock & Republic® brand has an exclusive wholesale distribution and licensing arrangement with Kohl’s Corporation that covers all branded apparel, accessories and other merchandise in the U.S.
Wrangler® and Lee® products outside of the U.S. are positioned as higher fashion and have higher selling prices. VF’s largest international jeanswear businesses are located in Europe and Asia, where Wrangler® and Lee® products are sold through department, specialty and concession retail stores, independently-operated partnership stores, online at www.wrangler.com and www.lee.com and on brand websites with strategic digital accounts. We also market Wrangler® and Lee® products to mass merchant, department and specialty stores in Canada and Mexico. In addition, we currently have approximately 45 VF-operated stores primarily 


located in Europe and Asia, which are an important vehicle for representing our brands' image and marketing message directly to consumers. In international markets where VF does not have retail operations, Wrangler® and Lee® products are marketed through distributors, agents, licensees and single-brand or multi-brand partnership stores.
Our world-class supply chain, including owned manufacturing facilities, coupled with advanced vendor-managed inventory and retail floor space management programs with many of our major retailer customers, gives us a competitive advantage in our U.S. jeanswear business. We receive periodic point-of-sale information from these customers, at the individual store and style-size-color stock keeping unit level. We then ship products based on that customer data to ensure their selling floors are appropriately stocked with products that match their shoppers’ needs. Our system capabilities allow us to analyze our retail customers’ sales, demographic and geographic data to develop product assortment recommendations that maximize the productivity of their jeanswear selling space and optimize their inventory investment.
On August 13, 2018, VF announced its intention to spin-off its Jeans business, which includes the Wrangler®, Lee® and Rock & Republic® brands, into an independent, publicly traded company. The spin-off was completed on May 22, 2019. The Jeans business, which also includes the Wrangler® RIGGS brand and the VF Outlet™ business, represented approximately 19% of VF revenue and operating income during the year ended March 2019 on a VF-historical reporting basis.


4 VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K


DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER OPERATIONS

Our direct-to-consumer business includes full-price stores, outlet stores, e-commerce sites and concession retail locations. Direct-to-consumer revenues were 33% of total VF revenues in the year ended March 2019.
Our full-price stores allow us to display a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers. These experiences provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers. The complete and impactful presentation of products in our stores also helps to increase sell-through of VF products at our wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness, education and visibility. VF-operated full-price stores generally provide gross margins that are well above VF averages.
In addition, VF operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional value-based locations. These outlet stores carry merchandise that is specifically designed for sale in our outlet stores and serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing VF to sell a significant portion of excess, discontinued and out-of-season products at better prices than otherwise available from outside parties, while maintaining the integrity of our brands.
Our growing global direct-to-consumer operations included 1,551 stores at the end of Fiscal 2019. We operate retail store locations for the following brands: Vans®, Timberland®, The North Face®, Kipling®, Dickies®, Lee®, Napapijri®, Icebreaker® and Wrangler®. We also operate 79 VF Outlet™ stores in the U.S. that sell a broad selection of excess VF products, as well as other non-VF products. Approximately 66% of VF-operated stores offer products at full price, and the remainder are outlet locations. Approximately 60% of our stores are located in the Americas region (48% in the U.S.), 


24% in the Europe region and 16% in the Asia-Pacific region. Additionally, we have approximately 1,200 concession retail stores located principally in Europe and Asia.
E-commerce represented approximately 25% of our direct-to-consumer business in the year ended March 2019. The following brands are marketed online: Vans®, The North Face®, Timberland® (excluding Timberland PRO®), Dickies®, Lee®, Icebreaker®, Wrangler® (excluding Wrangler® RIGGS), Kipling®, Smartwool®, Eastpak®, Napapijri®, JanSport®, Altra®, Timberland PRO®, Reef®, Wrangler® RIGGS, Eagle Creek®, Walls®, Lee® Riders® and Kodiak®. We continue to expand our e-commerce initiatives by rolling out additional, country-specific brand sites in Europe and Asia, which enhances our ability to deliver a superior, localized consumer experience.
We expect our direct-to-consumer business to continue growing as we expand our e-commerce presence and open new stores. We opened 110 stores during Fiscal 2019, concentrating on the brands with the highest retail growth potential: Vans® and The North Face®.
In addition to our direct-to-consumer operations, our licensees, distributors and other independent parties own and operate over 3,000 partnership stores. These are primarily mono-brand retail locations selling VF products that have the appearance of VF-operated stores. Most of these partnership stores are located in Europe and Asia, and are concentrated in the Timberland®, The North Face®, Vans®, Lee®, Dickies®, Wrangler®, Kipling® and Napapijri® brands.
The VF Outlet™ business and stores are included in the spin-off of the Jeans business that was completed on May 22, 2019, which is also discussed in the "Jeans Segment" section above. 



LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS

As part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of VF-owned brands, we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective manufacturing, distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally. We provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products.


Licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF brands. License agreements are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years, with conditional renewal options. Each licensee pays royalties to VF based on its sales of licensed products, with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement. Royalties generally range from 4% to 10% of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales. Royalty income was $95.9 million in the year ended March 2019 (less than 1% of total revenues), primarily from the Vans®, Dickies®, Lee®, Wrangler® and Timberland® brands. 



MANUFACTURING, SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION

Product design and innovation, including fit, fabric, finish and quality, are important elements across our businesses. These functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe.
In addition to the design functions of each brand, VF has three strategic global innovation centers that focus on technical and performance product development for apparel, footwear and jeanswear. The centers are staffed with dedicated scientists, engineers and designers who combine proprietary insights with consumer needs, and a deep understanding of technology and new 


materials. These innovation centers are integral to VF’s long-term growth as they allow us to deliver new products and experiences that consistently delight consumers, which drives organic growth and higher gross margins.
VF’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for producing, procuring and delivering products to our customers. VF is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain. VF sourced or produced approximately 560 million units spread across our brands. Our products are obtained from 19 VF-operated manufacturing facilities and approximately 700 independent contractor manufacturing facilities in 


VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 5

approximately 60 countries. Additionally, we operate 40 distribution centers and 1,551 retail stores. Managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development, forecasting, order management and warehouse management, along with our core enterprise resource management platforms.
In the year ended March 2019, 21% of our units were manufactured in VF-owned facilities and 79% were obtained from independent contractors. Products manufactured in VF facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than products procured from independent contractors. Products obtained from contractors in the Western Hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in Asia. However, contracting in the Western Hemisphere gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels. This combination of VF-owned and contracted production, along with different geographic regions and cost structures, provides a well-balanced, flexible approach to product sourcing. We will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment.
VF operates manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. A significant percentage of denim bottoms and occupational apparel is manufactured in these plants, as well as a smaller percentage of footwear and other products. For these owned production facilities, we purchase raw materials from numerous U.S. and international suppliers to meet our production needs. Raw materials include products made from cotton, leather, rubber, wool, synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn, as well as thread and trim (product identification, buttons, zippers, snaps, eyelets and laces). In some instances, we contract the sewing of VF-owned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors. Fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases. No single supplier represents more than 10% of our total cost of goods sold.
Independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished, ready-for-sale products to VF. These contractors are engaged through VF sourcing hubs in Hong Kong (with satellite offices across Asia) and Panama. These hubs are responsible for managing the manufacturing and procurement of product, supplier oversight, product quality assurance, sustainability within the supply chain, responsible sourcing and transportation and shipping functions. In addition, our hubs leverage proprietary knowledge and technology to enable certain contractors to more effectively control costs and improve labor efficiency. Substantially all products in the Outdoor and Active segments, as well as a portion of products for our Work and Jeans segments, are obtained through these sourcing hubs. 
Management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties, tariffs and quotas. We limit VF’s 


sourcing exposure through, among other measures: (i) diversifying geographies with a mix of VF-operated and contracted production, (ii) shifting of production among countries and contractors, (iii) sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available, and (iv) sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements. VF does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the U.S. State Department.
All VF-operated production facilities throughout the world, as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture VF products, must comply with VF’s Global Compliance Principles. These principles, established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards, are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices, worker age, work hours, health and safety conditions, environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations. In addition, our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent, nonprofit organization, Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (“WRAP”), which promotes global ethics in manufacturing.
VF, through its contractor monitoring program, audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce VF products at locations across the globe. Each of the approximately 700 independent contractor facilities, including those serving our independent licensees, must be pre-certified before producing VF products. This pre-certification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a VF Terms of Engagement agreement. We maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms. Additional information about VF’s Code of Business Conduct, Global Compliance Principles, Terms of Engagement and Environmental Compliance Guidelines, along with a Global Compliance Report, is available on the VF website at www.vfc.com.
VF did not experience difficulty in fulfilling its raw material and contracting production needs during Fiscal 2019. Absent any material changes, VF believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through (i) the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands, geographies and channels of distribution, (ii) increases in the prices of its products, and (iii) cost reduction efforts. The loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business.
Product is shipped from our independent suppliers and VF-operated manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the world. In some instances, product is shipped directly to our customers. Most distribution centers are operated by VF, and some support more than one brand. A portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers.

SEASONALITY

VF’s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual brands, and are historically stronger in the second half of the calendar year. On a quarterly basis in Fiscal 2019, revenues ranged from a low of 20% of full year revenues in the first fiscal quarter to a high of 29% in the third fiscal quarter, while operating margin ranged from a low of 6% in the fourth fiscal quarter to a high of 17% in the second fiscal quarter. This variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our Outdoor segment, where 12% of the segment’s revenues occurred in the first fiscal quarter compared to 35% in the third fiscal quarter of Fiscal 2019. With changes in our mix of business and the growth 


of our retail operations, historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends.
Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital increases early in the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the calendar year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements, particularly during the fourth quarter of the calendar year.



ADVERTISING, CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH

During the year ended March 2019, our advertising and promotion expense was $845.7 million, representing 6% of total revenues. We advertise in consumer and trade publications, on radio and television and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the Internet. We also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media, radio and television. We sponsor sporting, musical and special events, as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products. We employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending, and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments.
We provide advertising support to our wholesale customers, including independent partnership stores, in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products. We also participate in shop-in-shops and concession retail arrangements, which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific VF brand within our customers' stores and other locations, to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products.
We contribute to incentive programs with our wholesale customers, including cooperative advertising funds, discounts and 


allowances. We also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of discounts, rebates and coupon offers that are eligible for use in certain VF-operated stores, brand e-commerce sites and concession retail locations.
In addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands, VF and its associates actively support our communities and various charities. For example, The North Face® brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation, such as The North Face Endurance Challenge® and The North Face Explore Fund™ programs. The Timberland® brand has a strong heritage of volunteerism, including the Path of Service™ program that offers full-time employees up to 40 hours of paid time off a year to serve their local communities through global service events such as Earth Day in the spring and Serv-a-palooza in the fall. The Wrangler® brand launched the Tough Enough to Wear Pink™ program, which honors and raises money for breast cancer survivors, and the National Patriot Program™, which funds agencies that serve wounded and fallen American military veterans and their families. The Vans® brand has hosted annual Vans® Earth Day and Vans® Gives Back Day events in which all employees at the brand's headquarters spend the day volunteering in the community. 



SUSTAINABILITY

VF is one of the world’s largest apparel, footwear and accessories companies and has a responsibility to make a positive impact on our industry and planet through advancing sustainable business practices. VF plans to achieve significant progress in several key areas of sustainability, including people, products, supply chains, materials and facilities, to create a positive global impact.
VF’s Sustainability & Responsibility strategy, Made for Change, launched in 2017, targets key areas to drive transformational change and create value for our business. The strategy is focused on new circular and sustainable business models to (i) harness retail opportunities in new sectors, (ii) scale foundational social and environmental programs to lead the industry toward greater progress at a faster rate, and (iii) empower our brands, associates, and consumers to act with purpose and impact with intention.
In 2017, VF committed to measurably improve the lives of two million supply chain workers and others within their communities, by 2030. Since then, VF launched a Worker and Community Development Program with strategic initiatives focused on (i) water 


and sanitation, (ii) health and nutrition, and (iii) childcare and education. These programs have already impacted over one hundred thousand people in more than 30 factories and communities. We are also prioritizing transparency to ensure our global supply chain improves the lives of people and the planet. In October 2018, VF successfully launched traceability maps to demonstrate the end-to-end (farm-to-front door) traceability of nine iconic VF-brand products. The enterprise will scale its traceability efforts over the next three years with a plan to enhance visibility across all VF brands. 
Dedication to continued sustainability progress is particularly focused in the realm of VF product materials. In 2017, VF set a goal of sourcing 50% recycled nylon and polyester for products by 2025, with a targeted 35% reduction in negative impact of key materials. VF also pledged to not use fur in any of our products, in support of newly released Animal Derived Materials & Forest Derived Materials policies. VF is committed to using sustainable cotton across the organization. We have a goal to procure cotton primarily from the U.S. and Australia, since both countries use advanced and 


VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 7

efficient growing methods, or through the Better Cotton Initiative (“BCI”), which helps small holder farmers reduce their environmental impact while improving farmers’ livelihoods. In 2018, VF used approximately 36,000 metric tons of certified BCI cotton and 600 metric tons of organic cotton. 
Progress continues to be made toward the goals set for VF internal facilities that include (i) the sourcing of 100% of electricity from renewable sources within VF-owned and operated facilities by 2025, in line with the enterprise commitment to RE100, and (ii) achieving Zero Waste at 100% of VF internal distribution center locations by 2020, with 17 facilities already certified.
VF brands are equally committed to sustainability action in their sectors. In 2018, Vans® launched a shoe recycling pilot at 23 


southern California stores. Timberland® used 96% "Leather Working Group" certified leather, 75% certified BCI or organic cotton, and now produces 69% recycled, organic, or renewable products. The North Face® expanded its Climate Beneficial Wool collection, launched in 2017. These products are made in the U.S. from sustainable farms. The North Face® also launched the Renewed collection in 2018 selling previously owned, damage-and-repaired or used products. The recommerce model addresses one of the apparel industry’s biggest challenges, textile waste, and offers our products at a lower price point, which allows new consumers to experience our brands. 



OTHER MATTERS

Competitive Factors
Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand for VF’s brands and products. VF is well-positioned to compete in the apparel, footwear and accessories sector by developing high quality, innovative products at competitive prices that meet consumer needs, providing high service levels, ensuring the right products are on the retail sales floor to meet consumer demand, investing significant amounts into existing brands and managing our brand portfolio through acquisitions and dispositions. Many of VF’s brands have long histories and enjoy strong recognition within their respective consumer segments.
Intellectual Property
Trademarks, trade names, patents and domain names, as well as related logos, designs and graphics, provide substantial value in the development and marketing of VF’s products, and are important to our continued success. We have registered this intellectual property in the U.S. and in other countries where our products are manufactured and/or sold. We vigorously monitor and enforce VF’s intellectual property against counterfeiting, infringement and violations of other rights where and to the extent legal, feasible and appropriate. In addition, we grant licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products utilizing our intellectual property in product categories and geographic areas in which VF does not operate.
Customers
VF products are sold on a wholesale basis to specialty stores, mid-tier and traditional department stores, national chains and mass 


merchants. In addition, we sell products on a direct-to-consumer basis through VF-operated stores, concession retail stores and brand e-commerce sites. Our sales in international markets are growing and represented 41% of our total revenues in the year ended March 2019, the majority of which were in Europe.
Sales to VF’s ten largest customers, all of which are retailers based in the U.S., amounted to 19% of total revenues in the year ended March 2019. Sales to the five largest customers amounted to approximately 15% of total revenues in the year ended March 2019. Sales to VF’s largest customer totaled 8% of total revenues in the year ended March 2019, the majority of which were derived from the Jeans business that was included in the spin-off completed on May 22, 2019.
Employees
VF had approximately 75,000 employees at the end of Fiscal 2019, of which approximately 42% were located in the U.S. In international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by trade-sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be good.
Backlog
The dollar amount of VF’s order backlog as of any date may not be indicative of actual future shipments and, accordingly, is not material to an understanding of the business taken as a whole.
