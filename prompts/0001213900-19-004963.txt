Overview
 
We are an emerging company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of advanced nutrition products that improve muscle health and performance. As used in this report, the “Company”, “MYOS”, “our”, or “we” refers to MYOS RENS Technology Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 11, 2007. On March 17, 2016, we merged with our wholly-owned subsidiary and changed our name from MYOS Corporation to MYOS RENS Technology Inc. Prior to February 2011, we did not have any operations and did not generate revenues. In February 2011, we entered into an intellectual property purchase agreement pursuant to which our subsidiary purchased from Peak Wellness, Inc. certain trademarks, trade secrets, patent applications and certain domain names as well as the intellectual property pertaining to Fortetropin®, a proprietary bioactive composition derived from fertilized egg yolk that has been shown in clinical trials to increase lean muscle mass, size and strength.
 
Since February 2011, our principal business activities have been  focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of advanced nutrition products, functional foods, and other technologies aimed at maintaining or improving the health and performance of muscle tissue. Our initial core ingredient is Fortetropin®, a natural and proprietary bioactive composition derived from fertilized egg yolk that has been shown in clinical trials to increase lean muscle mass, size and strength. Our plan of action is to: (i) create a sales platform through marketing products containing our proprietary ingredient Fortetropin® in established, growing, and new markets and strategic selection of partnerships and collaborations to maximize near-term and future revenues, (ii) deepen our scientific understanding of the activity of Fortetropin® as a natural product to improve muscle health and performance, and to leverage this knowledge to strengthen and build our intellectual property estate, (iii) conduct research and development activities to evaluate the impact of Fortetropin® on muscle health and wellness in humans as well as domestic pets. (iv) identify other products and technologies which may broaden our portfolio and define a business development strategy to protect, enhance and accelerate the growth of our products, (v) reduce the cost of manufacturing through process improvement, and (vi) identify contract manufacturing organizations that can fully meet our future growth requirements and (vii) develop a differentiated and advantaged consumer positioning, brand name and iconography.
 
We continue to pursue additional distribution and branded sales opportunities. We expect to continue developing our own core branded products in markets such as functional foods, sports and fitness nutrition, rehabilitation and restorative health, and domestic pets, and to pursue international sales opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure distribution arrangements on terms acceptable to us, or that we will be able to generate significant sales of our current and future branded products.

General
 
Following our purchase of Fortetropin® in February 2011, we have been focusing on the discovery, development, and commercialization of nutritional ingredients, functional foods, and other technologies aimed at maintaining or improving the health and performance of muscle tissue.
 
Fortetropin® is the Company’s proprietary all-natural food ingredient clinically shown to increase muscle size, lean body mass and strength as part of resistance training in humans. Fortetropin® has also been shown to reduce muscle atrophy in dogs following orthopedic surgery. Fortetropin® is made from fertilized chicken egg yolks using a proprietary process that retains the biological integrity and bioactivity of the product.  In a rodent study, Fortetropin® was shown to up-regulate muscle building pathways and down-regulate muscle degrading pathways.

Strategy
 
Our strategy is to understand the complex genetic and molecular pathways regulating muscle mass and function. Understanding the impact of complex regulatory pathways which act to build and maintain healthy lean muscle is central to our research and development activities. We are developing nutritional products that target specific mechanisms to promote muscle health in ways that cannot be met by other food products.
 
We will seek to gain market share for our core branded products in the 1) sports and fitness nutrition, 2) rehabilitation and restorative health and 3) domestic pet muscle health verticals by (i) formulating and developing new and complementary product lines, (ii) expanding U.S. distribution by increasing the channels of sale, (iii) expanding distribution geography beyond the U.S. and (iv) seeking strategic relationships with other distributors.
 
Global Market Overview 
 
According to the Natural Marketing Institute, the Dietary Supplement, Functional Food and Beverage, and Natural Personal Care markets represent more than $250 billion in annual worldwide sales in 2017. The market for the global sports nutrition segment grew to $14 billion in 2017 and is expected to continue to grow to $24 billion by 2022, according to data from Euromonitor International. In the United States alone, revenues reached $8.3 billion in 2017 consisting of nearly 60% of the total with a growth of 11% per year through 2022, reaching an expected $13 billion by 2021 which makes it the fastest growing market for functional foods.
 
We believe our proprietary ingredient, Fortetropin® is well-positioned to market to a wide base of consumers looking for nutritional and performance maximization as well as for wellness and health maintenance products as they age. Additionally, the medical community has increased its focus on muscle health, specifically focusing on the aging U.S. population that can benefit most from maintaining their muscle health.
 
We believe the combination of the foregoing marketplace characteristics, combined with the experience of our directors and our management team and our current and future products, will enable our business to succeed.
 
Clinical Research to Evaluate Effects of Fortetropin®
 
In March 2013, we completed a human clinical trial which demonstrated that Fortetropin® temporarily reduced serum myostatin levels. In this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel, single dose study involving 12 healthy adult male subjects per arm, test subjects in the active arm were administered a 6.6 gram dose of Fortetropin® mixed with vanilla fat free/sugar free pudding. An equal amount of vanilla fat free/sugar free pudding alone was given to the placebo arm. Blood samples were collected at baseline (before dosing) and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours post dose intervals for measurement of serum myostatin levels. Results demonstrated about a 30% decrease in serum myostatin levels in the Fortetropin® arm compared to baseline during the 24 hour period. 
 
In another study performed on our behalf at the University of Tampa, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of Fortetropin® on skeletal muscle growth, lean body mass, strength, and power in recreationally trained individuals who rely heavily on satellite cell activation. Forty-five subjects were divided into placebo, 6.6 gram and 19.8 gram dosing arms of Fortetropin® daily for a period of 12 weeks. All exercise sessions were conducted and monitored by trained personnel. Standardized diets consisted of roughly 54% carbohydrates, 22% fat and 24% protein. There were no differences in total calories and macronutrients consumed between groups. Dual emission X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was utilized to measure lean body mass and fat mass. Direct ultrasound measurements determined muscle thickness of the quadriceps.

Results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in serum myostatin levels in both Fortetropin® arms but not in the placebo group.
 

The results also demonstrated a statistically significant increase in both muscle thickness and lean body mass in subjects taking Fortetropin® but not in subjects taking a placebo. Strength and power endpoints, as measured by bench press, leg press and Wingate power, significantly increased from baseline in all study groups. No study related adverse events were reported during the study.

Association between Muscular Strength and Mortality
 
Information about the importance of muscle was published in a clinical study at the Karolinska Institutet’s Department of Biosciences and Nutrition at NOVUM, Unit for Preventive Nutrition, in Huddinge, Sweden. The study tracked 8,762 men aged 20-80 who were evaluated over an average period of 18.9 years in a prospective cohort study to measure the association between muscular strength and mortality in men. After adjusting for age, physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, baseline medical conditions, and family history of cardiovascular disease, the study found that muscular strength is inversely and independently associated with deaths from all causes and cancer in men. The findings were valid for men of normal weight, those who were overweight, and younger or older men, and were valid even after adjusting for several potential confounders, including cardiorespiratory fitness. This study extends previous studies that showed the importance of muscular strength as a predictor of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer in a large cohort of men. Several prospective studies have also shown that muscular strength is inversely associated with all-cause mortality. These data suggests that muscular strength adds to the protective effect of cardiorespiratory fitness against the risk of death in men. Moreover, it might be possible to reduce all-cause mortality among men by promoting regular resistance training.

Clinical Studies and Basic Research Programs
 
We invest in research and development activities externally through academic and industry collaborations aimed at enhancing our products, optimizing manufacturing and broadening the product portfolio. We have developed the following collaborations with various academic centers:

● | In May 2018, we entered into a research agreement with Weill Cornell Medical College to study the efficacy of Fortetropin® in preventing weight and muscle loss associated with cancer in a mouse model of lung cancer. The results from this research did not show that Fortetropin® had a significant impact on cancer-related weight and muscle loss. Therefore, we have decided not to pursue future cachexia-related studies with Fortetropin®. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In March 2018, we entered into a research agreement with Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, to work with Rutgers researchers in a program focused on discovering compounds and products for improving muscle health and performance. 


● | In December 2017, we entered into an agreement with the University of California, Berkeley’s Department of Nutritional Sciences & Toxicology. The research project will study the effects of Fortetropin® on increasing the fractional rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis in men and women between 60 and 75 years old. The Principal Investigator for this clinical study is William J. Evans, PhD, Adjunct Professor of Human Nutrition at the Department of Nutritional Sciences & Toxicology at the University of California, Berkeley. Professor Evans, a leading authority in muscle health research, is coordinating the activities of a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and physicians. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, 20 subjects, men and women 60 – 75 years of age, will consume either Fortetropin® or a placebo for 21 days along with daily doses of a heavy water tracer. After 21 days, a micro-biopsy will be collected from each subject to determine the fractional rate of muscle protein synthesis. In July 2018, we agreed to pay for additional costs incurred in connection with the study. We anticipate the clinical study will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2019.

● | In April 2017, we entered into an agreement with the College of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University to study the impact of Fortetropin® on reducing muscle atrophy in dogs after Tibial-Plateau-Leveling Osteotomy (“TPLO”) surgery to repair the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL). In August 2018, we agreed to pay for additional costs incurred in connection with the study. The study was completed and Kenneth R. Harkin DVM, DACVIM (SAIM), Professor and Section Head, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University and the principal investigator of the study presented the results titled, “The Impact of Fortetropin® Supplementation on Dogs Recovering from TPLO surgery” at the VMX Conference in Orlando in January 2019. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the impact of Fortetropin® on attenuating muscle atrophy following a common surgical procedure known as TPLO in 100 dogs at Kansas State University. TPLO is performed by veterinary surgeons to repair ruptures of the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL), a canine ligament that is analogous to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in humans. In the weeks that follow TPLO surgery, the immobilized operated limb frequently shows significant muscle loss due to muscle disuse atrophy. The objective of the study was to determine whether Fortetropin® could reduce this muscle atrophy with respect to a macronutrient-matched placebo. The study showed that: i) Fortetropin® prevented the loss of muscle mass in these dogs as measured by the thigh circumference in their affected and unaffected limbs; ii) Fortetropin® supplemented dogs had a significant improvement in percentage of weight supported by the affected limb (more rapid return to normal stance force distribution) than the placebo group; and iii) Fortetropin® prevented a rise in serum myostatin levels in dogs. We believe the results of this study are not only relevant to our veterinary business, which was established in 2018, but are also relevant to our human muscle nutrition business, with a particular focus on recovery and rehabilitation.

● | In May 2015, we initiated a dose response clinical study led by Jacob Wilson, Ph.D., CSCS*D, Professor of Health Sciences and Human Performance at the University of Tampa, to examine the effects of Fortetropin® supplementation on plasma myostatin levels at various dosing levels in young adult males and females. This study is intended to help us better define the dose response curve, the minimal effective dose and effects of Fortetropin® on serum myostatin. In this double blind placebo controlled clinical study, 80 male and female subjects ranging in ages between 18 and 22 were randomized into four groups such that no significant differences in serum myostatin concentration existed between groups. Following assignment to one of the four groups, blood samples were collected to establish baseline values. Subjects were subsequently supplemented with three different doses of Fortetropin® (2.0g, 4.0g and 6.6g) and a matching placebo for one week. Following one week of supplementation, blood samples were collected and serum myostatin levels were assayed. Results demonstrated that Fortetropin® reduces serum myostatin levels at daily doses of 4.0g and 6.6g. This research, which continues to build upon our current understanding of Fortetropin®, may result in the formulation of new products. An abstract of this study was presented at the 2016 International Conference on Frailty & Sarcopenia Research (Philadelphia, PA) in April 2016.

● | In August 2014, we entered into a research agreement with Human Metabolome Technologies America, Inc., (“HMT”), to apply their proprietary, state-of-the-art capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) technologies to characterize the metabolomic profiles of plasma samples obtained from healthy male subjects who used either Fortetropin® or placebo with the goal of identifying metabolites with pro-myogenic activity in the plasma samples of subjects who took Fortetropin® as well as examining the effect on glucose and fat metabolism. HMT used a metabolite database of over 290 lipids and over 900 metabolites to identify potential plasma biomarkers related to muscle growth. The study was completed during the fourth quarter of 2014. Initial data from this study indicated that subjects who received Fortetropin® displayed differential metabolomic profiles relative to subjects who received placebo. The early indications of plasma biomarkers may guide future study design for Fortetropin® clinical trials by identifying clinically-relevant endpoints. The results from this study were presented at the Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders Conference (Berlin, Germany) in December 2016.

● | In May 2014, we entered into an agreement with the University of Tampa to study the effects of Fortetropin® supplementation in conjunction with modest resistance training in 18-21 year old males. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which examined the effects of Fortetropin® on skeletal muscle growth, lean body mass, strength, and power in recreationally trained males. Forty-five subjects were divided into placebo, 6.6g and 19.8g dosing arms of Fortetropin® daily for a period of 12 weeks. Results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in both muscle thickness and lean body mass in subjects taking Fortetropin® but not in subjects taking placebo. The clinical study also analyzed blood myostatin levels via high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (“ELISA”) based analysis. Results demonstrated statistically significant reduction in serum myostatin levels in both groups that consumed Fortetropin® but not in the group that consumed the placebo. The lipid serum safety protocol demonstrated that daily use of Fortetropin® at recommended and three times the recommended dose had no adverse lipid effect and did not adversely affect cholesterol, HDL or triglyceride levels. Data from the study was presented at the American College of Nutrition’s 55th annual conference. A separate mechanism of action study at the University of Tampa demonstrated that in addition to reducing serum myostatin levels, Fortetropin® showed activity in mTOR and Ubiquitin pathways, two other crucial signaling pathways in the growth and maintenance of healthy muscle. Specifically, the preclinical data showed that Fortetropin® up-regulates the mTOR regulatory pathway. The mTOR pathway is responsible for production of a protein kinase related to cell growth and proliferation that increases skeletal muscle mass. Up-regulation of the mTOR pathway is important in preventing muscle atrophy. The preclinical study also demonstrated that Fortetropin® acts to reduce the synthesis of proteins in the Ubiquitin Proteasome Pathway, a highly selective, tightly regulated system that serves to activate muscle breakdown. Over-expression of the Ubiquitin Proteasome Pathway is responsible for muscle degradation. We believe that Fortetropin® has the ability to regulate production in the Ubiquitin Proteasome Pathway, which may have significant implications for preventing age-related muscle loss. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The foregoing programs are an integral part of our business strategy. We believe that they will provide a clear scientific rationale for Fortetropin® as an advanced nutritional product and support its use in different medical and health applications in the future.
 
We intend to pursue additional clinical studies and medical research to support differentiated and advantaged marketing claims, to build and enhance our competitive insulation through an aggressive intellectual property strategy, to develop product improvements and new products in consumer preferred dosage forms, to enhance overall marketing, and to pursue best in class personnel.

Product Marketing, Distribution and Sales History

Our commercial focus is to leverage our clinical data to develop multiple products to target the large, but currently underserved markets focused on muscle health. The sales channels through which we sell our products are evolving. The first product we introduced was MYO-T12, a proprietary formula containing Fortetropin® and other ingredients. The formula was sold under the brand name MYO-T12 and later as MYO-X through an exclusive distribution agreement that terminated in March 2015 and the product line was discontinued.
 
In February 2014, we expanded our commercial operations into the age management market through a distribution agreement with Cenegenics Product and Lab Services, LLC (“Cenegenics”), under which Cenegenics distributed and promoted a proprietary formulation containing Fortetropin® through its age management centers and its community of physicians focused on treating a growing population of patients focused on proactively addressing age-related health and wellness concerns. The distribution agreement with Cenegenics expired in December 2016. The Company recorded $200 of sales in 2017 to Cenegenics. There were no sales to Cenegenics in 2018. As of the filing date of this Report we have not received any new sales orders from Cenegenics.
 
In April 2015 we launched Rē Muscle Health®, our own direct-to-consumer brand with a portfolio of muscle health bars, meal replacement shakes and daily supplement powders each containing a full 6.6 gram single serving dose of Fortetropin®. Our Rē Muscle Health® products were sold through our website, www.remusclehealth.com, and www.amazon.com until March 2017 when the product line was discontinued. The Company recorded $22 of net sales in 2017 of Rē Muscle Health® products and no net sales in 2018. Any remaining expired inventory was written off as of the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
In May 2016, we launched Physician Muscle Health Formula®, a proprietary formulation containing Fortetropin® and sold the product directly to physicians to distribute to their patients who are focused on wellness. The Company recorded $24 of net sales in 2017 of Physician Muscle Health Formula® and $24 of net sales in 2018. Any remaining expired inventory was written off as of the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
In March 2017 we launched Qurr®, a Fortetropin®-powered product line formulated to support the vital role of muscle in overall well-being as well as in fitness. Qurr® is a line of flavored puddings, powders, and shakes for daily use. Our Qurr® line of muscle-focused over-the-counter products are available through a convenient, direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform. All Qurr® products contain Fortetropin®, our proprietary ingredient which has been clinically demonstrated to reduce serum myostatin levels which helps increase muscle size and lean body mass in conjunction with resistance training. We recorded $164 of net sales in 2017 and $175 of net sales in 2018 for our Qurr® product line. Any remaining expired inventory was written off as of the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
In March 2018, we launched Yolked®, a Fortetropin®-powered product which is NSF Certified for Sports, and developed and marketed to collegiate and professional athletes who want to increase their muscle size and performance with an all-natural advanced nutrition product. We recorded $117 of net sales in 2018 for our Yolked® product line. 
 
In June 2018, we launched our Fortetropin® based pet product Myos Canine Muscle Formula® (“MCMF”). Two veterinarian hospitals had previously performed some informal observational studies with older dogs experiencing muscle atrophy and observed positive results after taking our pet product. We believe that the positive feedback received from the veterinarian community, together with the positive results from our study with Kansas State University, will enable us to grow our domestic pet business product line. In 2018 we recorded $44 of net sales of MCMF.
 
We continue to pursue additional distribution and branded sales opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure distribution arrangements on terms acceptable to us, or that we will be able to generate significant sales of our current and future branded products. We expect to continue developing our own core branded, functional food products in markets such as sports and fitness nutrition, rehabilitation and restorative health and the domestic pet market while also pursuing international sales opportunities. We remain committed to continuing our focus on various clinical trials in support of enhancing our commercial strategy as well as enhancing our intellectual property assets, to develop product improvements and new products, and to reduce the cost of our products by finding more efficient manufacturing processes and contract manufacturers.

Intellectual Property 
 
We have adopted a comprehensive intellectual property strategy, the implementation of which is ongoing. We are focusing our efforts on ensuring our current commercial products and processes, and those currently under development, are being protected to the maximum extent possible. We are in the process of filing multiple patent applications in the United States and abroad, and we are currently prosecuting pending patent applications in the United States, all of which are directed towards our compositions and methods of manufacturing the same. In addition to a proactive protection strategy, we are conducting defensive due diligence to ensure that our products and processes do not encroach upon the rights of third parties. Moreover, we are also engaged in a survey of the intellectual property landscape of potential competitors, and are devising a proactive path to stay ahead of such potential competitors.
 
In January 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued the Company a new patent (United States Patent # 10,165,785) titled, “Process for Producing Composition for Increasing Muscle Mass”. A new patent significantly enhances the Company’s existing intellectual property portfolio, enabling MYOS to protect its advanced technologies for the development of innovative nutrition products to address musculoskeletal health. The new patent covers an advanced, state-of-the-art manufacturing process for a fertilized, egg yolk-derived composition that helps maintain the natural bioactivity of egg yolk without compromising its safety. It was developed by researchers at the German Institute of Food Technologies/DIL (“DIL”) including Dr. Volker Heinz, Director of DIL and a co-inventor on the patent. DIL has assigned full rights of this patent to the Company. The processes covered by these patents are used to manufacture our nutrition products.
 
In August 2014, the USPTO, issued U.S. Patent No. 8,815,320 B2 to the Company covering its proprietary methods of manufacturing Fortetropin®. The patent entitled “Process for Producing a Composition Containing Active Follistatin” provides intellectual property protection for manufacturing Fortetropin®, the key ingredient in our core commercial muscle health products, and carries a patent term through early 2033.
 
We intend to file as many applications and continuation/divisional/continuation-in-part applications as possible. Several additional pending patent applications that we are pursuing include:
 

● | Methods of treating degenerative muscle disease – covering methods of treating various degenerative muscle diseases, such as sarcopenia, with avian egg-based products and the compositions thereof. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Methods and products for increasing muscle mass – covering various combinations of proteins, lipids and other molecules, which are active in the natural form of our core commercial products, which may be combined to yield improved products and methods for increasing muscle mass. 


● | Egg-based product containing hydroxymethylbutyrate, or HMB, for the treatment of degenerative muscle disease – covering a line of products combining avian egg-based products with HMB for improved treatment of degenerative muscle diseases and the methods of treating the same. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Egg-based product containing leucine for treatment of degenerative muscle disease - covering a line of products combining avian egg-based products with leucine for improved treatment of degenerative muscle diseases and the methods of treating the same. 
● | Methods of treatment of degenerative muscle disease using egg-based products and testosterone replacement therapy – covering methods of treating degenerative muscle disease in combination with testosterone replacement therapy for improved results. 
● | Methods of treatment of cancer and neurological diseases using avian egg powder. 
● | Methods of treatment of insulin resistance and Type II diabetes using avian egg powder. 
● | Method of enhancing overall health and longevity using avian egg powder. 

 
In addition to patent protection, we are also engaged in protecting our brands, including corporate brands and product brands, and have sought trademark registrations in the United States for the same. We have implemented a clearance strategy for new brands that we intend to launch, to ensure any risk of encroaching on the rights of third parties is minimized.
 
We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that protecting our key trademarks is crucial to our business strategy of building strong brand name recognition. These trademarks are crucial elements of our business, and have significant value in the marketing of our products. Federally registered trademarks have a perpetual life, provided that they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used correctly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third parties to attempt to cancel a trademark if priority is claimed or there is confusion of usage. We rely on common law trademark rights to protect our unregistered trademarks. Common law trademark rights generally are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used, while a United States federal registration of a trademark enables the registrant to stop the unauthorized use of the trademark by third parties in the United States. Much of our ongoing work, including our research and development, is kept highly confidential. As such, we have adopted corporate confidentiality policies that comply with the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and the New Jersey Trade Secret Act to protect our most valuable intellectual property assets.

Regulatory Environment
 
The importing, manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling, distributing, selling and advertising of our current and future products may be subject to regulation by one or more federal or state agencies. The Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, has primary jurisdiction over our products pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act, or the DSHEA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The DSHEA provides the regulatory framework for the safety and labeling of dietary supplements, foods and medical foods. In particular, the FDA regulates the safety, manufacturing, labeling and distribution of dietary supplements. In addition, the Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service, or APHIS, regulates the importation of our primary product from Germany. The Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, and the FDA share jurisdiction over the promotion and advertising of dietary supplements and nutrition products. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the two agencies, the FDA has primary jurisdiction over claims that appear on product labels and labeling and the FTC has primary jurisdiction of product advertising.
 
The term “medical foods” does not pertain to all foods fed to sick patients. Medical foods are prescription foods specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone. They were defined in the FDA’s 1988 Orphan Drug Act Amendments and are subject to the general food safety and labeling requirements of the FDCA but are exempt from the labeling requirements for health claims and nutrient content claims under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. Medical foods are distinct from the broader category of foods for special dietary use and from traditional foods that bear a health claim. In order to be considered a medical food, a product must, at a minimum, be a specially formulated and processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring food in its natural state) for oral ingestion or tube feeding (nasogastric tube), be labeled for the dietary management of a specific medical disorder, disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements and be intended to be used under medical supervision.
 
Compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations is a critical part of our business. We endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. However, as with any regulated industry, the laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and there can be no assurances that a government agency would necessarily agree with our interpretation of the governing laws and regulations. Moreover, we are unable to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. These regulations could, however, require the reformulation of our products to meet new standards, market withdrawal or discontinuation of certain products not able to be reformulated. The risk of a product recall exists within the industry although we endeavor to minimize the risk of recalls by distributing products that are not adulterated or misbranded. However, the decision to initiate a recall is often made for business reasons in order to avoid confrontation with the FDA.
 
Our products are required to be prepared in compliance with the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMPs, as set forth in 21 CFR Part 111. Fortetropin®, the active ingredient in our products, must be imported into the United States in conformance with United States Department of Agriculture requirements for egg products. Other statutory obligations include reporting all serious adverse events on a Medwatch Form 3500A. To date, we have not filed a Medwatch Form 3500A with the FDA nor have we been placed on notice regarding any serious adverse events related to any of our products. Since eggs are considered a major food allergen under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, we are required to label all our products containing Fortetropin® to note that they contain egg product.
 
Advertising of dietary supplement products is subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTCA, which prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive trade acts or practices in or affecting commerce. The FTCA provides that the dissemination of any false advertising pertaining to foods, including dietary supplements, is an unfair or deceptive act or practice. Under the FTC’s substantiation doctrine, an advertiser is required to have a reasonable basis for all objective product claims before the claims are made. All advertising is required to be truthful and not misleading. All testimonials are required to be typical of the results the consumer may expect when using the product as directed. Accordingly, we are required to have adequate substantiation of all material advertising claims made for our products. Failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either a deceptive or unfair practice.

In addition, medical foods must comply with all applicable requirements for the manufacturing of foods, including food Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), registration of food facility requirements and, if applicable, FDA regulations for low acid canned food and emergency permit controls. The FDA considers the statutory definition of medical foods to narrowly constrain the types of products that fit within this category of food. The FDA inspects medical food manufacturers annually to assure the safety and integrity of the products. Failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable requirements could lead to sanctions that could adversely affect our business.
 
We cannot predict what effect additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation, impose additional record keeping or require expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation.
 
Manufacturing; Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
We are committed to producing and selling highly efficacious products that are trusted for their quality and safety. To date, our products have been outsourced to third party manufacturers where the products are manufactured in full compliance with cGMP standards set by the FDA. All of the raw materials for our current products are currently sourced from third-party suppliers. Since the beginning of 2012, we have been focusing on the efficiency and economics of manufacturing Fortetropin® and the related production costs to achieve maximum savings in production.
 
We currently have an agreement with only one third-party manufacturer of Fortetropin®, who will manufacture the formula exclusively for us in perpetuity, and may not manufacture the formula for other entities. We have multiple vendors for blending, packaging and labeling our products.
 
Competition
 
The market for nutritional supplements is highly competitive. Companies operating in the space include PepsiCo Inc., Glanbia Plc. GNC Holdings, The Coca-Cola Company, GlaxoSmithKline, Abbott Laboratories, Nestle S.A. and Universal Nutrition. Competition is based on price, quality, customer service, marketing and product effectiveness. Our competition includes numerous nutritional supplement companies that are highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels and product categories. In addition, large pharmaceutical companies and packaged food and beverage companies compete with us in the nutritional supplement market. These companies and certain nutritional supplement companies have broader product lines and/or larger sales volumes than us and have greater financial and other resources available to them and possess extensive manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities. Other companies are able to compete more effectively due to a greater extent of vertical integration. Private label products of our competitors, which in recent years have significantly increased in certain nutrition categories, compete directly with our products. In several product categories, private label items are the market share leaders. Increased competition from such companies, including private label pressures, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Many companies within our industry are privately-held and therefore, we are unable to assess the size of all of our competitors or where we rank in comparison to such privately-held competitors with respect to sales.
Insurance
 
We maintain commercial liability, including product liability coverage, and property insurance. Our policy provides for a general liability of $5.0 million per occurrence, and $10.0 million annual aggregate coverage. We carry property coverage on our main office facility to cover our liability, tenant’s improvements, property, and inventory. We maintain commercial general liability and products liability insurance with coverage of up to $5.0 million.
Employees
 
We currently have 12 full-time employees (including one executive officer). We also employ several consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good.
