ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a late-stage biotechnology company focused on designing, developing and commercializing innovative therapies and proprietary medical approaches to stimulate and to guide an anti-tumor immune response for the treatment of cancer. Our core platform technology, ImmunoPulse®, is a drug-device therapeutic modality comprised of a proprietary intratumoral electroporation (“EP”) delivery device. The ImmunoPulse® platform is designed to deliver plasmid DNA-encoded drugs directly into a solid tumor and promote an immunological response against cancer. The ImmunoPulse® device can be adapted to treat different tumor types, and consists of an electrical pulse generator, a reusable handle and disposable applicators. Our lead product candidate is a DNA-encoded interleukin-12 (“IL-12”) called tavokinogene telseplasmid (“TAVO”). The ImmunoPulse® EP platform is used to deliver TAVO intratumorally, with the aim of reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the treated tumor. The activation of the appropriate inflammatory response can drive a systemic anti-tumor response against untreated tumors in other parts of the body. In 2017, we received Fast Track designation and Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for TAVO in metastatic melanoma, which could qualify TAVO for expedited FDA review, a rolling Biologics License Application review and certain other benefits.
 
Our current focus is to pursue our study of TAVO in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in melanoma, triple negative breast cancer (“TNBC”), and squamous cell carcinoma head and neck (“SCCHN”).
 
KEYNOTE-695 targets melanoma patients who are definitive anti-PD-1 non-responders. In May 2017, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck”) in connection with KEYNOTE-695 study. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, both companies will bear their own costs related to manufacturing and supply of their product, as well as be responsible for their own internal costs. We are the study sponsor and are responsible for external costs. The KEYNOTE-695 study is currently enrolling and treating patients and we plan to complete enrollment in this study in first half 2020. This study is a registration-directed, Phase 2b open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe.
 
In May 2018, we entered into a second clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck with respect to a Phase 2 study of TAVO in combination with KEYTRUDA® to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC, who have previously failed at least one systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy. This study is referred to as KEYNOTE-890. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, both companies will bear their own costs related to manufacturing and supply of their product, as well as be responsible for their own internal costs. We are the study sponsor and are responsible for external costs. The KEYNOTE-890 study is currently enrolling and treating patients. We plan to complete enrollment in fourth quarter 2019 and provide interim preliminary data from this study at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (“SABCS”) in December 2019. The study is a Phase 2 open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in the United States and Australia.

OMS-131 is an investigator-initiated clinical trial conducted by the University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. This study targets patients with SCCHN and is a single-arm open-label clinical trial in which 35 evaluable patients will receive TAVO, KEYTRUDA® and epacadostat. OMS-131 is currently enrolling and treating patients.
 
In June 2019, we entered into a collaboration with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (“DFCI”), a world-leading cancer research and treatment institution, and The Marasco Laboratory, a cutting-edge CAR T-cell research laboratory led by Wayne Marasco, M.D., Ph.D., a renowned cancer immunology researcher, to develop CAR T-cell therapies for triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer.
 
We intend to continue to pursue other ongoing or potential new trials and studies related to TAVO, in various tumor types. In addition, we are also developing our next-generation EP device and applicator, including advancements toward prototypes, pursuing discovery research to identify other product candidates that, in addition to IL-12, can be encoded into propriety plasmid-DNA, delivered intratumorally using EP. Specifically, we are developing a new, propriety technology to potentially treat liver, lung, bladder, pancreatic and other difficult to treat visceral lesions through the direct delivery of plasmid-based IL-12 with a new Visceral Lesions Applicator (“VLA”).


The VLA has been designed to work with our recently announced generator, APOLLOTM, to leverage plasmid-optimized EP, enhancing the depth and frequency of transfection of immunologically relevant genes into cells located in deep visceral lesions. Using our next-generation technology, our goal is to reverse the immunosuppressive mechanisms of a tumor, as well as to expand our pipeline. We believe that the flexibility of our propriety plasmid-DNA technology allows us to deliver other immunologically relevant molecules into the tumor microenvironment in addition to the delivery of plasmid-DNA encoding for IL-12. In March 2019, the Company had a poster presentation at the 2019 America Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) where it presented pre-clinical data regarding its new anti-tumor product candidate, which will amplify the power of intratumoral IL-12 through the addition of both CXCL9, a critical T cell chemokine, and anti-CD3, a membrane bound pan T cell stimulator. These other immunologically relevant molecules may complement IL-12’s activity by limiting or enhancing key pathways associated with tumor immune subversion.
 
We have established a collaboration with Emerge Health Pty (“Emerge”), the leading Australian company providing full registration, reimbursement, sales, marketing and distribution services of therapeutic products in Australia and New Zealand, to commercialize TAVO and plan to make it available under Australia’s Special Access Scheme (“SAS”) in 2019. As a specialized Australian pharmaceutical company focused on the marketing and sales of high-quality medicines to the hospital sector, Emerge has previously made numerous other products successfully available under Australia’s SAS.
 
Cancer Immunotherapy Treatments: Background
 
Many traditional modalities for treating cancer have limited clinical efficacy and are frequently associated with significant negative side effects. Immunotherapy, a relatively new therapeutic modality that has received significant attention in recent years, focuses on modulating the immune system to treat cancer rather than directly killing the cancer cells. Systemic delivery of immune-modulating proteins, such as interleukin-2 and interleukin-10, or IL-2, and IL-10, has shown early indications of efficacy, but with significant mechanism-based toxicity.
 
Recent attention has also focused on the development of monoclonal antibody drugs, which target critical “immune checkpoint” proteins and augment anti-tumor immunity. Therapies using monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4), anti-PD-1 (program cell-death-1) and anti-PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand-1), are being developed for the treatment of several cancers and have been approved for the treatment of multiple sold tumor cancers. Although these new immuno-oncology agents have shown clinical benefit for patients with late-stage cancer across multiple tumor types, only a small subset of the overall patient population responds to these therapies. Certain tumors are able to evade the immune system. We believe that when tumors do not have any immune cells inside (immune desert) or surrounding the tumor (immune excluded), immune checkpoint therapies are less effective or ineffective. These tumors are sometimes referred to as “cold” tumors.

We believe that if we can convert an inactive, or “cold,” tumor with a low frequency of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, that limit the anti-tumor response and remove the interferon signature, into an active, or “hot,” tumor that can activate the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 pathway, then we can potentially increase the number of patients who respond to these therapies. We believe our TAVO platform addresses this objective, as it has the potential to reshape the tumor microenvironment in patients with an immunologically cold tumor into a highly-inflamed tumor with a fully engaged PD-1 / PD-L1 axis. The immunological components that enable this conversion relates to the intratumoral delivery of TAVO, which increases the density of TILs, and in the presence of an anti-PD-1 antibody, adaptive resistance can be neutralized allowing for the maximal T cell cytotoxicity.
 
There is a significant unmet medical need for patients who may not respond well to these therapies on their own. In particular, for patients who have “cold” tumors and would be unlikely to respond to an immune checkpoint therapy alone, our focus is to develop a therapeutic that has the ability to directly modulate the microenvironment of the tumor by stimulating a local immune reaction through the intratumoral delivery of IL-12 or other immune-modulating molecules. This immune cascade allows anti-tumor immune cells to infiltrate the lesion, turning the tumor “hot” and ultimately generates a productive systemic immune response. In doing so, we believe intratumoral delivery of immune-modulating molecules, such as IL-12 provides a strong biological rationale for treatment in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4.
 
CLINICAL PROGRAMS
 
Our Lead Product Candidate: TAVO
 
Our lead product candidate, TAVO, is a drug-device combination. The drug consists of a plasmid construct called tavokinogene telseplasmid, or TAVO, with plasmid DNA-encoded, IL-12, and is delivered into a tumor using our proprietary electroporation device. Our clinical data indicates that the in vivo gene transfer of plasmid DNA-encoded IL-12 using EP is well-tolerated and anti-tumor activity has been observed after a single cycle of treatment. Importantly, regression in distant, non-injected/non-electroporated lesions has also been observed (“abscopal effect”) in different solid cancers.

MELANOMA 
 
Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer with rapidly rising incidences both in the U.S. and internationally. The National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (“SEER”) Program estimates that 96,480 new melanoma cases were diagnosed in 2019, representing 5.5% of all new cancer cases in the U.S. Overall, the five-year survival rate for melanoma, regardless of disease stage, is high (92.2%); however, according to SEER 2019, for patients who present with metastatic disease and receive systemic treatment, the five-year survival rate is considerably lower at less than 25%. Despite recent advances in therapy, advanced metastatic melanoma continues to present a major and increasing burden with significant morbidity and mortality.
 
KEYNOTE-695 Study (ongoing)
 
The KEYNOTE-695 study is a Phase 2b, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study of TAVO in combination with an intravenous anti-PD-1 antibody, Merck’s KEYTRUDA®, in patients with histological diagnosis of melanoma with progressive locally advanced or metastatic disease defined as stage III/IV. KEYNOTE-695 study is evaluating 100 patients and is currently enrolling and treating patients in the United States, Canada, and Australia across approximately 20 sites, and we plan to treat patients in Europe.
 
KEYNOTE-695 enrollment criteria with respect to anti-PD-1 checkpoint failure is highly restrictive. In order to be considered an anti-PD-1 checkpoint failure, all patients must have histological or cytological confirmed diagnosis of unresectable melanoma (Stage III or IV) with progressive locally advanced or metastatic diseases, be refractory to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, namely KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) or OPDIVO® (nivolumab), as either monotherapy or in combination with other approved checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies according to their approved label, and must have relapsed as documented disease progression within 12 weeks of the last dose of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies according to RECIST v1.1, measured by radiologic assessment. Patients can have no intervening therapies between failure of anti-PD-1 therapy and the TAVO / KEYTRUDA® combination treatment with the exception of approved BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations. Patients that are BRAF eligible must receive and progress following BRAF treatment. The primary endpoint of the study, by blinded independent central review, is to assess the objective response rate (“ORR”) based on RECIST v1.1.
 
KEYNOTE-695 is a registration directed clinical trial. In order to be eligible for accelerated approval, the TAVO / KEYTRUDA® combination must treat a serious condition and provide a meaningful advantage over available therapies. Prior to the commencement of the study, within the context of the Fast Track designation request, the Company reviewed the patient inclusion and progression criteria, and other study requirements with FDA. In light of this review, we strictly defined the patient population to be enrolled in KEYNOTE-695 to include only those patients who have definitively failed prior anti-PD-1 checkpoint therapy, as determined by the above-described rigor, and who have exhausted all available FDA approved treatment options.


We had previously provided topline preliminary data updates at The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (“SITC”) in November of 2018, at our Business Outlook in February 2019, and at several Company investor presentations in the fall of 2019 which were made available publicly on the Company’s website. We plan to complete enrollment in the study in the first half 2020. Lastly, based on the outcome of the study and feedback from FDA, we plan to file for accelerated approval with the FDA for this patient population in second half 2020.

OMS-102 (completed) 
 
OMS-102 was an open-label, multi-center, Phase 2 trial of TAVO and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced, metastatic melanoma. In August 2015, we enrolled the first patient in our Phase 2 investigator-sponsored clinical trial led by the clinicians at the University of California, San Francisco, or UCSF. Huntsman Cancer Institute in Utah was the second clinical site. The primary endpoint of this study was to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of TAVO and KEYTRUDA® in patients with stage III/IV metastatic melanoma whose tumors are characterized by low frequency of CD8+/PD-1+/CTLA-4+ TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes). The primary endpoint of the study was best overall response rate by RECIST of the combination regimen. Recent data suggests that patients whose tumors are lacking TILs or CD8+ T-cells at the tumor margin or generally have a low frequency of CD8+/PD-L1+/CTLA-4+ TILs are unlikely to respond to anti-PD-1 therapies such as KEYTRUDA®, while tumors with a frequency of CTLA-4+/PD-L1+/CD8+ >20% in the tumor are likely to have a clinical benefit. Therapies, such as TAVO, that promote TIL generation and PD-L1 positivity play an important role in augmenting the clinical efficacy of the anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents.
 
Initial data were presented in February 2017 at ASCO-SITC and the trial stopped enrolling patients in September 2017, allowing the Company to progress on KEYNOTE-695. The final data was selected for prominence at SITC 2017 and was presented during the oral poster session. The overall response rate in the 22-patient population was 43% by RECIST v1.1. at week 24 (best overall response rate was 50% by clinical assessment), with one Grade-3 adverse event of cellulitis that resolved with antibiotics. Based on these results, we believe the combination of TAVO and KEYTRUDA® demonstrated efficacy in this low TIL metastatic melanoma patient population and was well-tolerated. Further, long-term follow up has shown responses with significant durability, with all patients who experienced a response remaining in responding status. To date only one patient has required additional surgery to maintain remission.
 
OMS-100 (completed)
 
OMS-100 was an open-label Phase 2 trial of TAVO monotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma. On December 5, 2014, we released top-line six-month data from a Phase 2 repeat dose trial of TAVO in patients with stage III/IV metastatic melanoma. We presented final data at the Melanoma Bridge Conference in 2018. This study is now locked with the data collected at 6 clinical centers. Thirty (30) patients with stage III/IV melanoma received up to four cycles of TAVO delivered by EP on days one, five and eight of each 12-week cycle. Of the 28 patients in the study who were evaluable, an objective response rate of 35.7% (10/28 patients) was observed. Five patients (17.9%) had a CR, 5 patients (17.9%) had a PR, 12 patients (42.9%) had SD. Of the distant untreated and assessed lesions that decreased in longest dimension by ≥ 30%, 17.4% (20/115) were assessed. Of the 26 patients with ≥ 1 assessed lesion, 12 patients (46.2%) had ≥ 1 assessed distant lesion with major regression (≥ 30%). Two patients were not evaluated due to not having evaluable distant untreated lesions. Other clinical endpoints included objective response rate, local and distant lesion regression, duration of response, overall survival and safety. The results of this study demonstrated that multiple treatment cycles of TAVO were well-tolerated, with no treatment-limiting toxicities. The majority of adverse events were localized to the treatment site and were Grade-1 or -2 in severity.
 
In order to continue to acquire clinical and immune correlational data on melanoma patients treated with TAVO, the protocol of the OMS-I100 study was amended in February 2014 to enroll up to an additional 30 patients. Enrollment in OMS-I100 Addendum was completed in March 2016. The study is now completed and the Company presented final data at the Melanoma Bridge Conference being held on November 29 – December 1, 2018. These data were selected for an oral presentation and will include new data demonstrating that local treatment with TAVO alone led to whole-body immune responses associated with regression of untreated lesions in almost half of the 50 patients treated on the study.

Following this trial, a retrospective analysis of the patients who went on to receive an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was conducted. Results from this retrospective analysis suggested that TAVO primes and enhances response rates to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Specifically, of the 29 patients who completed TAVO, 14 subsequently received an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Overall, five of these 14 patients (36%) experienced a complete response and four patients experienced a partial response (29%), for an overall response rate of 65% (75% without intervening therapies). Two patients experienced stable disease (14%) and three patients experienced progressive disease (21%). We believe this retrospective sequential data could suggest combinatorial potential of an immune-priming effect with TAVO prior to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Data from this retrospective analysis formed the clinical rationale for conducting OMS-I102.
 
TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER (TNBC)
 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among U.S. women and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Worldwide, approximately 170,000 new cases of TNBC are diagnosed each year, with TNBC representing one of the four main molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancer, accounting for approximately 10 -20% of all breast cancer, according to breastcancer.org. According to the American Cancer Society, for patients who present with Stage 4 metastatic disease, the five-year survival rate is considerably lower at approximately 22%.
 
TNBC frequently affects younger women (less than 40 years old) and is characterized by higher relapse rates than estrogen receptor positive breast cancers. TNBC is also associated with an increased risk of recurrence, both locally and in distant sites including the lungs and brain. Advanced TNBC remains a significant area of unmet medical need and there is no established standard-of-care. Chemotherapy is the current standard-of-care treatment in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and metastatic settings. Due to the loss of the tumor cell receptors, patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormonal therapy or treatments targeting the oncogenic HER2 pathway. The standard of care for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic disease is cytotoxic chemotherapy, leading to a median survival of approximately 13 months from the time of recurrence or diagnosis of distant metastases. Importantly, for patients with metastatic TNBC, the traditional chemotherapeutic treatment approach has undergone limited advance in the last decades, and no regimen is specifically indicated in this unique patient population.
 
KEYNOTE-890 study (ongoing)
 
KEYNOTE-890 is a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study in the United States and Australia of TAVO in combination with an intravenous anti-PD-1 antibody, Merck’s KEYTRUDA®, in patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of inoperable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have received at least one prior line of approved systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
 
In collaboration with Merck, we plan to complete enrollment in KEYNOTE-890 in fourth quarter 2019. We had previously provided topline interim preliminary data in May 2019 on the first group of patients enrolled from this study and we plan to provide additional interim preliminary data on these patients at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (“SABCS”) in December 2019. Based on the outcome of the study and feedback from FDA, we plan to conduct additional clinical research in TNBC in a registration directed clinical trial.
 
OMS-140 (complete)
 
OMS-140 is a Phase 2, monotherapy biomarker study in patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC. The study is being conducted at Stanford University and is designed to assess whether TAVO increases TNBC tumor immunogenicity by driving a pro-inflammatory cascade that leads to increases in cytotoxic TILs. The presence and number of TILs is thought to be a key requirement for promoting the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-1. By driving cytotoxic immune cells into the tumor, TAVO could be used in combination with checkpoint blockade therapies, which have reported some, but limited, activity in TNBC.
 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the potential of TAVO to promote a pro-inflammatory molecular and histological signature, and the secondary objectives include the evaluation of safety and tolerability; evaluation of local ablation effect (% of necrosis) and description of other evidence of anti-tumor activity. The study has been subsequently amended to capture the post TAVO treatments and outcomes.

Preliminary data was presented at the SABCS annual meeting in 2018 and the enrollment in this trial (n=10) is now complete. The clinical observations from this study prompted the Company to conduct KEYNOTE-890, which is currently underway.
 
SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA HEAD & NECK CANCER (SCCHN)
 
Head and neck cancer represent approximately 4% of all cancers in the U.S., and it is estimated over 65,000 patients will develop head and neck cancer this year with over 14,000 deaths.
 
OMS-131 (ongoing)
 
OMS-131 is an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by the University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. This study targets patients with SCCHN and is a single-arm open-label clinical trial in which 35 evaluable patients will receive TAVO, KEYTRUDA® and epacadostat. OMS-131 is currently enrolling and treating patients.
 
OMS-131, also referred to as the “TRIFECTA” study, was formed from the clinical observations from a 2017 pilot study of TAVO in head and neck cancer patients, which demonstrated clinical and biological results including evidence of synergy between TAVO and PD-1 antibodies in the disease.
 
DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUE
 
In June 2019, the Company entered into a collaboration with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (“DFCI”), a world-leading cancer research and treatment institution, and The Marasco Laboratory, a cutting-edge CAR T-cell research laboratory led by Wayne Marasco, M.D., Ph.D., a renowned cancer immunology researcher, to develop CAR T-cell therapies for triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company has acquired an exclusive option to licensing rights to the CAR T-cell product candidates and associated IP resulting from the research being conducted at The Marasco Laboratory using engineered single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies in a dual-targeted bi-specific CAR T-cell approach. Previous research conducted by The Marasco Laboratory suggests their proprietary CAR T-cell technology has the potential to be effective against numerous solid tumor indications, while minimizing the toxicity that current CAR T-cell technologies exhibit when applied beyond liquid tumor indications.
 
ROSEWELL PARK COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER
 
The Company has an ongoing research collaboration with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (“Roswell Park”) to evaluate the use of Roswell Park’s intravital microscopy (“IVM”) and TAVOPLUS (enhanced IL-12 DNA-plasmid), in combination with our APOLLO™ EP generator in preclinical studies. The collaboration is led by Joseph Skitzki, MD, FACS, Associate Professor of Immunology, Associate Professor of Surgery and Chair of the Melanoma/Sarcoma Disease Site Research Group at Roswell Park.
DUKE UNIVERSITY
 
The Company has an ongoing research collaborative with Duke University’s Center for Applied Therapeutics (“Duke University”) to evaluate TAVOPLUS in combination or sequenced with a HER2-plasmid vaccine administered our APOLLO™ EP generator in preclinical studies. The research is led by Herbert Kim Lyerly, M.D., George Barth Geller Professor, Professor of Immunology, Surgery and Pathology at Duke University School of Medicine.
Other Trials and Studies
 
In addition to the trials and studies described above, we have also pursued and closed Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, although we do not have any active clinical programs related to these indicators at this time.

Visceral Lesion Applicator
 
We are developing our next-generation EP device and applicator, including advancements toward prototypes, pursuing discovery research to identify other product candidates that, in addition to IL-12, can be encoded into propriety plasmid-DNA, delivered intratumorally using EP. Specifically, we are developing a new, propriety technology to potentially treat liver, lung, bladder, pancreatic and other difficult to treat visceral lesions through the direct delivery of plasmid-based IL-12 with a new Visceral Lesions Applicator (“VLA”).
 
The VLA has been designed to work with our new EP generator, APOLLOTM, which optimizes the balance of lower voltage and longer pulse duration to significantly increase DNA-plasmid cellular transfection rates. Moving forward, we see significant opportunity to leverage this innovative technology to secure new partnerships that may allow us to expand our capabilities and drive shareholder value.
 
Emerge Health Pty
 
We have established a collaboration with Emerge Health Pty (“Emerge”), the leading Australian company providing full registration, reimbursement, sales, marketing and distribution services of therapeutic products in Australia and New Zealand, to commercialize TAVO and plan to make it available under Australia’s Special Access Scheme (“SAS”) in 2019. As a specialized Australian pharmaceutical company focused on the marketing and sales of high-quality medicines to the hospital sector, Emerge has previously made numerous other products successfully available under Australia’s SAS.
Our ImmunoPulse® Platform
 
The effectiveness of many drugs and DNA-based therapeutics is dependent upon their crossing the cell membrane. In the 1970s, it was discovered that the brief application of high-intensity, pulsed electric fields to the cell resulted in a temporary and reversible increase in the permeability of the cell membrane, a mechanism known as “electroporation.”
 
The transient, reversible nature of the electrical permeabilization of cell membranes and the resulting increase in intracellular delivery of therapeutic agents is the underlying basis of our ImmunoPulse® therapeutic approach. Our EP delivery system consists of an electrical generator, a reusable applicator handle and disposable tips. While the extent of membrane permeabilization depends on various electrical, physical, chemical, and biological parameters, research with EP delivery has demonstrated an improvement in cellular uptake of chemical molecules such as chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., bleomycin and cisplatin), and nucleic acids (e.g., DNA and RNA).
 
Multiple viral and non-viral delivery modalities have been developed to deliver nucleic acids into cells, however, many of these methods have faced challenges related to the safe and efficient expression of the DNA-encoded biologic into the intended target cells. For example, viral mediated delivery technologies appear to be efficient at transfecting cells, but they have suffered from significant safety issues related to the immunogenicity of the viral vector, shedding of the virus, and potential integration of the viral DNA into the host genome. Other non-viral delivery methods have employed the use of nanotechnology to coat the DNA with fat molecules, called lipids. Although these lipid nanoparticle technologies have been used extensively in the clinic to deliver DNA-encoded biologic agents, few particles have been developed with the ability to specifically target cancer cells; instead, many of these particles naturally target the liver, which can lead to potential liver toxicities.
 
Like viral vectors and lipid nanoparticle technologies, EP has been used extensively in the clinic to deliver multiple therapeutic agents, including DNA. However, unlike these other technologies, EP has not seen the same safety concerns. In fact, the use of EP to deliver bleomycin intratumorally has been approved for use in Europe for cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma, and has been accepted across many European countries, including the United Kingdom.

Our ImmunoPulse® platform employs an EP system designed to create favorable conditions to deliver plasmid DNA encoding immunotherapeutic cytokines directly into cells of the tumor microenvironment. The cytokine-encoding plasmid is first injected into the tumor. A needle-electrode array then delivers the electrical pulses produced in the pulse generator.
 
Our lead product candidate, TAVO, consists of a plasmid construct encoding the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12 that is injected into the tumor and delivered into the tumor cells through in vivo EP using our ImmunoPulse® technology. We are also researching other DNA-encoded, immunologically-active molecules, with an aim of developing additional immunotherapeutic drugs that, when delivered through EP using our ImmunoPulse® platform, may be capable of breaking the immune system’s tolerance to cancer.
 
Commercialization
 
Strategy
 
Our primary focus is to continue our clinical development strategy for TAVO, including our planned and ongoing clinical trials discussed under “Clinical Programs” above and potentially other trials we may pursue in the future.
 
As a part of our commercialization strategy, we also regularly investigate and evaluate potential collaboration opportunities, to identify rational combinations with existing and emerging monoclonal antibody therapies and other drugs. For instance, we may seek to collaborate with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to provide us with access to complementary technologies and/or greater resources. In addition, we may seek to expand the applications of our technologies through strategic collaborations or other opportunities, such as in-licensing or strategic acquisitions, and we may seek to out-license our intellectual property to other companies to leverage our technologies for applications that we may not choose to internally and independently develop.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
Currently, we assemble and store certain components of our EP system, which is our proprietary delivery mechanism for our TAVO product candidate, and we utilize the services of qualified contract manufacturers to make the remaining components of these systems and for the manufacture, testing, packaging and storage of our plasmid product candidate for clinical trials or other studies. The manufacture of our systems and product supplies requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the use of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. We do not own and have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) manufacturing capabilities for device or drug substance or product. We expect to increase our reliance on third-party manufacturers if and when we commercialize any of our product candidates and systems.
 
We rely upon a small number of suppliers and manufacturers for our clinical activities. For manufacturing and distributing we use Cryosite, PCI, Richter-Helm Biologics, VGXI, Baxter Oncology GmbH, SGS, Minnetronix and EG Medacys, which collectively account for approximately 90% of clinical materials and EP systems support and materials. We believe there are alternate sources of raw material supply and finished goods manufacturing to satisfy our requirements, although transitioning to other vendors, if necessary, could result in significant delay or material additional costs. In addition, for combination trials, we typically rely exclusively on one supplier of the non-company-owned product used in the trial, such as our reliance upon Merck for the supply of KEYTRUDA® in the KEYNOTE-695 and KEYNOTE-890 studies.
 
We are ISO 13485:2016 certified and comply with all appropriate standards and authorities for the assembly, manufacturing and activities we conduct, and we have established an audited quality management system for these activities. In addition, all contract manufacturers that we use must comply with various requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection programs. See “Regulation” below for more information.

Competition
 
The biotechnology industry is intensely competitive. This competitive environment stimulates an ongoing and extensive search for technological innovation and necessitates effective and targeted marketing strategies to communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of products to healthcare professionals in private practice and group practices and payors in managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, and Medicare and Medicaid services.
 
We face competition from a number of sources, including large pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. We compete against all other developers of cancer treatments, including other immunotherapy treatments as well as other types of treatments for the cancer indications on which we are focused. In particular, a number of companies, some of which are large, well-established pharmaceutical companies, have development strategies similar to our current focus. These companies include, among others, Bristol Myers-Squibb, Iovance Therapeutics, Syndax, Dynavax Technologies, Checkmate, Immunomedics and Idera Pharmaceuticals. In addition, we also compete with other clinical-stage biotechnology companies for funding and support from healthcare and other investors and potential collaboration relationships with larger pharmaceutical or other companies, as well as for personnel with expertise in our industry. We are smaller and less well-funded than many of our competitors, and we have a shorter and less proven operating history and a less recognizable and established brand name than many of our competitors. In addition, some of our competitors have commercially available products, which provide them with operating revenue and other competitive advantages.
 
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates more rapidly than we can or may obtain more robust patent protection or other intellectual property rights to protect their product candidates and technologies, which could limit or prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates. If we are able to obtain regulatory approval of one or more of our product candidates, we will face competition from approved products or products under development by larger companies that may address our targeted indications. If we directly compete with these very large entities for the same markets and/or customers, their greater resources, brand recognition, sales and marketing experience and financial strength could prevent us from capturing a share of these markets or customers. Our competitors may also develop products that are more effective, more useful, better tolerated, subject to fewer or less severe side effects, more widely prescribed, less costly or more widely accepted for other reasons than any of our products that obtain regulatory approvals, and our competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing, distributing and otherwise marketing their products.
 
We expect our product candidates, if approved and commercialized, to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, extent of adverse side effects and convenience of treatment procedures. We may not be able to effectively compete in any of these areas. Presently, we compete with other biotechnology companies for funding and support on the basis of our technology platforms and the potential value of our product candidates based on the factors described above.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe our success and ability to compete depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and technologies, including obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection of our product candidates and their respective components and underlying technologies, including devices, formulations, manufacturing methods and methods of treatment, and appropriately safeguarding unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how. As of October 2019, we owned 15 issued patents (6 U.S. and 9 foreign) and 47 pending patent applications (13 U.S. and 34 foreign). We are currently prosecuting pending patent applications in various jurisdictions. One of our patent applications in the US with claims directed to cytokine-based intratumoral immunotherapies in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, was issued on October 1, 2019. In addition, we have licensed intellectual property rights that allow us to use certain EP technology to deliver DNA-based cytokines as an immunotherapy, as well as catheter-based delivery devices. From these in-licensed portfolios, we have access to 75 issued U.S. and foreign issued patents (4 from USF, 14 from Gaeta Therapeutics, and 57 from Inovio) and 15 U.S. and foreign pending patent applications (2 from USF, 4 from Gaeta Therapeutics, and 9 from Inovio). We expect to continue to file additional patent applications, if and when appropriate, as our research and development efforts continue. The majority of the patents in our portfolio, including owned and in-licensed patents and fundamental patents directed toward our proprietary technology, expire between 2019 and 2039. We have previously obtained patent protection through an asset purchase agreement with Inovio covering our original clinical electroporation device. The primary patents providing protection of this original device have expired or will expire in 2019. However, the Company has filed and will continue to file patent applications this year, on our next generation electroporation devices and applicator handles and our next generation DNA-based cancer immunotherapeutics.
 
In addition, we have entered into a cross-license agreement for certain electroporation technology with Inovio, including patent protection for some of our clinical electroporation devices (some of which, as noted above, have recently expired or will soon expire). Under the terms of the agreement, Inovio has granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain of its electroporation patents, and in exchange, we have granted to Inovio an exclusive license to certain of our purchased technology in a limited field of use.
 
Regulation 
 
Commercialization Approval for our Product Candidates
 
Biotechnology companies are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation relating to the ability to market and sell any therapeutic or medical device. In the United States, these regulations are principally enforced by the FDA and state government agencies. Outside the United States, these regulations are typically administered by various health authorities comparable to the FDA in countries where products or product candidates are researched, tested, manufactured and/or marketed.
United States
 
General
 
In the United States, the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, other state statutes and regulations, many of which are administered and enforced by the FDA, govern or influence, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, record-keeping, approval, labeling, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, import and export of product candidates such as ours. Under these regulations, we and our contract manufacturers may be subject to periodic inspection of our facilities, quality control and other procedures, and operations and/or the testing of our product candidates during and after the approval process for a product candidate, to confirm compliance with all applicable regulations, including current good manufacturing practices and other applicable requirements.

Possible penalties or other consequences for failure to comply with these regulatory requirements include, among others, observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could force us to modify our clinical programs or other activities; clinical holds on our ongoing clinical programs; adverse publicity from the FDA or others; the FDA’s suspension of its review of pending applications; fines; product recalls or seizures; total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution; labeling changes; withdrawal of previously granted product approvals; enforcement actions; injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution. Any such sanctions, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
Approval Process
 
Before any new drug, device or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug or biologic, can be marketed in the United States, FDA approval is required. The process required by the FDA before a product may be marketed in the United States generally involves, among other things:

● | completion of non-clinical testing; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | completion of chemistry, manufacturing, and control testing, commonly known as CMC; 
● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND) for human clinical testing, which must be accepted and effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 
● | performance of adequate human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for each intended use; 
● | for a stand-alone medical device, submission to the FDA of a premarket approval application (PMA) or 510(k) premarket notification, which the FDA must review and approve; and 
● | for a therapeutic, submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA), or biologic license application (BLA), which the FDA must review and approve. 

 
The pre-clinical and clinical testing and approval process can take many years and requires substantial company time, effort and financial resources. The receipt and timing of approval, if any, is uncertain. The results of pre-clinical tests, together with certain manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Once an IND is in effect, the protocol for each clinical trial to be conducted under the IND must be submitted to the FDA, which may or may not allow the trial to proceed. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drugs or biologics to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice requirements. For purposes of an NDA or BLA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its safety, tolerability and effectiveness. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications, and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted. 
● | Phase 3: The product candidate is administered in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety and to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product candidate. 
● | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval clinical trials to further assess the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic. 

 
The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. NDAs or BLAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things.
 
Once the NDA or BLA submission has been accepted, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Pursuant to the FDA’s performance goals, NDA and BLA standard reviews are to be completed within 10 months, subject to extensions by the FDA. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA often inspects the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with good manufacturing practices. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with good clinical practices before approving an NDA or BLA. If the FDA determines that an NDA or BLA is not approvable, then the FDA may outline the deficiencies and often will request that additional information be provided or additional clinical trials be completed. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional testing or information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
Further, even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is obtained, such approval would specify the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. Additionally, we would be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA with respect to any approved product, including requirements related to, among other things, drug or device listing, record-keeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, manufacturing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion, and reporting of adverse events associated with any approved products. Moreover, we could be required to conduct post-approval studies, such as Phase 4 clinical trials, or surveillance programs to monitor the safety of any approved products. FDA has the authority to stop or limit further marketing of a product or impose more stringent labeling restrictions based on the results of these post-approval programs or in the event of any unexpected or serious health or safety concern regarding any approved product.

Non-U.S. Regulation
 
If we pursue research and/or commercialization activities for our product candidates outside the United States, we would need to obtain necessary approvals from the regulatory authorities comparable to the FDA in applicable jurisdictions before we could commence clinical trials or marketing of our product candidates in these jurisdictions. In addition, we would become subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding safety and efficacy of our product candidates and governing, among other things, clinical trials, commercial activities, manufacture and distribution of our product candidates. The requirements to obtain product approvals vary widely from country to country, and the FDA’s approval requirements, review procedures and timelines may not be the same as or even similar to the requirements or a comparable foreign regulator. As a result, even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate in one country, we may be required to undertake additional clinical trials or studies, submit additional information, wait for longer review periods or make other efforts in order to obtain regulatory approvals in other desirable geographic markets.
 
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, constantly evolving and subject to significant change and fluctuation. The U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that currently impact our business include, among others:

● | the laws and regulations administered and enforced by the FDA, including the FDCA, and other federal statutes and regulations, discussed above; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, referred to collectively as the Affordable Care Act, which, in general and among other things, expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority, including requiring pharmaceutical companies to record and disclose to government agencies any transfers of value to doctors and teaching hospitals, and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to the federal False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute to make it easier to bring suits under these statutes; 
● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which generally prohibits, among other things, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration to induce the referral of an individual for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 


● | the federal false claims laws, which generally prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1986, or HIPAA, as amended by the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which, in general and among other things, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and impose requirements for the use of standardized electronic transactions with respect to transmission of such information; 
● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not be preempted by applicable federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.

--


Additionally, the healthcare compliance environment is continuously changing, with proposed revisions to or replacement of the Affordable Care Act at the federal level and with some states mandating implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, spending limits and reporting to state governments of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Further, to the extent we continue to pursue operations in foreign countries, such as our clinical activities in Australia, or in Canada, or if we seek to sell any product that obtains regulatory approval in a foreign country, we would be subject to different reporting and other compliance requirements in multiple jurisdictions, including foreign laws and regulations comparable to the U.S. laws and regulations described above.
 
All of these laws impose penalties for non-compliance, some of which may be severe. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, fines or other monetary damages or orders forcing us to curtail or restructure our operations.
 
Other Regulatory Requirements and Environmental Matters
 
We are or may become subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals, as well as environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and withdraw approvals.
 
In addition, to the extent we continue to pursue operations in foreign jurisdictions, we will be subject to anti-bribery laws in the United States and applicable foreign jurisdictions, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and comparable foreign laws. Further, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to other matters, including workplace health and safety, labor and employment, public reporting and taxation, among others, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including monetary penalties or imposition of sanctions or other corrective requirements.
 
Recent Events
 
On October 10, 2019, the Company announced that it entered into a strategic transaction (the “Transaction”) with Grand Decade Developments Limited, a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of China Grand Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Holdings Limited, a company formed under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“CGP”), and its affiliate, Sirtex Medical US Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Sirtex”).
