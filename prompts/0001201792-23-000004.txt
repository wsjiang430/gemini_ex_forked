ITEM 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
American Public Education, or APEI, provides online and campus-based postsecondary education and career learning to approximately 107,100 students through four subsidiary institutions. Our institutions offer purpose-built education programs and career learning designed to prepare individuals for productive contributions to their professions and society and to offer opportunities to advance students in their current professions or to help them prepare for their next career.
Our Vision and Mission 
Our vision is for education that transforms lives, advances careers, and improves communities. Our mission is to provide inclusive, high-quality and relevant education that empowers learners to achieve their ambitions and be of service to their communities while realizing return on their education investment. Our institutions of advanced learning are purpose-built to prepare service-minded students for employment, careers, and leadership in a diverse and changing world. We are the number one educator of active-duty military and of veterans, operate the nation’s largest pre-licensure nursing platform focused on a Diploma in Practical Nursing, or PN degree, and an Associate Degree in Nursing, or ADN degree, and operate one of the largest providers of training to the federal government and public workforce. 
Our Institutions 
We have four subsidiary institutions: American Public University System, or APUS, Rasmussen University, or RU, Hondros College of Nursing, or HCN, and Graduate School USA, or GSUSA. 
American Public University System
APUS provides online postsecondary education to approximately 88,900 adult learners. APUS traces its roots to American Military University, or AMU, which was founded in 1991 as a distance-learning, graduate-level institution for military officers seeking an advanced degree in military studies. APUS has broadened its focus to include other military communities, veterans, and public service and public service-minded communities, with a focus on educating those who serve, and has two components: AMU, which is focused on educating students from the military, national security, military-affiliated and service communities, like police, firefighters, emergency personnel, and government employees, and American Public University, or APU, which is focused on educating career-focused working adults with an emphasis on educating professionals working in service-related communities, including nursing, public health, public administration, and business administration. Today, a majority of APUS students are undergraduate-level students in addition to its graduate and certificate students.
APUS is exclusively an online institution of higher learning, designed to meet the needs of the military, military-affiliated, public service, and working adult students. Many of these students serve in positions requiring extended and irregular work schedules, are on call for rapid response missions, participate in extended deployments and exercises, travel or relocate frequently, and often must balance family and work demands. Although APUS’s focus has broadened since its founding, it continues to have an emphasis on its relationship with the military community. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 65% of APUS’s students self-reported that they served in the military on active-duty at the time of initial enrollment, and approximately 11% of APUS’s students self-reported that they are a military veteran. The remainder of APUS’s students are other military or military-affiliated professionals (such as reservists or National Guard members), public service professionals (such as law enforcement personnel or other first responders), and other non-military students (such as working adult students and military spouses).
APUS is institutionally accredited by The Higher Learning Commission, or HLC, a regional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, or ED, with an Open Pathway designation, which affords institutions greater opportunity to pursue institutional improvement projects than the alternative Standard Pathway designation. Most other higher education institutions accept APUS’s courses for transfer credit as a result of this accreditation.
Rasmussen University
RU provides nursing- and health sciences-focused postsecondary education to over 15,600 students at its 22 campuses in six states and online. At the beginning of its 123-year history, RU focused on educating business students to prepare them for practical careers in bookkeeping, secretarial services, and accounting. RU’s foundation of education that transforms lives created an inclusive institution built to serve those not typically served by traditional higher education. While RU continues to 
offer programs across a broad range of study including business, technology, and education, it launched its focus on healthcare education in 2006, and today offers a comprehensive “ladder” of nursing degrees, including pre-licensure PN and ADN degrees, post-licensure Bachelor of Science in Nursing, or BSN and RN to BSN degrees, Master of Science degrees in Nursing, Specialties and Nurse Practitioner, and a Doctorate of Nurse Practice. 
RU is committed to innovation in program delivery. For example, RU offers competency-based education, or CBE, helping to advance this learning approach where students learn by doing, manage their pace, and stay connected with faculty and peers. Additionally, virtually every nursing program at RU incorporates online content alongside lab and clinical or classroom components. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 7,600 students are pursuing nursing degrees at RU, over 90% of whom are enrolled in RU’s pre-licensure nursing degree programs, and approximately 8,000 students are enrolled in non-nursing programs.
RU is institutionally accredited by HLC with an Open Pathway designation and all of RU’s Nursing programs are programmatically accredited by specialty nursing accrediting bodies. As with APUS, most other higher education institutions accept RU’s courses for transfer credit as a result of RU’s HLC accreditation.
APEI acquired RU on September 1, 2021, which we refer to as the Rasmussen Acquisition, adding what we believe is an attractive portfolio of programs to APEI, with a strong alignment around mission and culture. 
Hondros College of Nursing
HCN provides nursing education to approximately 2,600 students across eight campuses in three contiguous Midwestern states with six campuses in Ohio, one campus in Indianapolis, Indiana, and one campus in suburban Detroit, Michigan, that opened in October 2022. HCN offers pre-licensure nursing programs that are designed to prepare individuals for productive careers through both a PN Degree and an ADN Degree, and two Direct Entry ADN Degree options that offer an accelerated graduation pathway for students who meet certain transfer, academic, and entrance exam requirements.
HCN’s students principally receive on-campus instruction at one of HCN’s campuses and offer certain courses in a virtual setting for those that prefer remote course learning. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 60% of HCN students were enrolled in the PN program, while 40% were enrolled in the ADN program.
HCN is institutionally accredited by the Accrediting Bureau for Health Education Schools, or ABHES, a national accrediting agency recognized by ED. HCN’s PN program is accredited by the National League for Nursing Commission for Nursing Education Accreditation, or NLN CNEA.
Graduate School USA
GSUSA, based in Washington, DC, is one of the largest providers of career learning to the federal government and public employee workforce. We acquired substantially all of the assets of GSUSA on January 1, 2022, advancing our focus on delivering training that provides students with pathways to employment and career advancement. GSUSA provides contract training to more than 100 federal government agency customers and through direct enrollment by federal, state, and municipal government employees, contractors, and non-government employees. 
GSUSA provides career learning both in-person at its headquarters facility in Washington, D.C. and at customer sites, as well as online. GSUSA offers a catalog of more than 300 courses specializing in foundational and continuing professional development, as well as leadership training and practice management through its Center for Leadership and Management and Government Audit Training Institute. GSUSA trained over 25,000 individuals in 2022. 
GSUSA is accredited by the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training, or ACCET. 
Our Segments
We have three reportable segments: the APUS Segment; the RU Segment; and the HCN Segment. Unallocated corporate activity, eliminations, and GSUSA’s results are included in “Corporate and Other” in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial information regarding each of our reportable segments is reported and discussed in this Annual Report in the sections entitled “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. 
The following information for our segments is as of December 31, 2022.
2022 Developments and Future Financial Objectives
Acquisition Activity
We acquired GSUSA on January 1, 2022, advancing our focus on career learning that provides pathways to employment and career advancement, and began repositioning GSUSA and focusing it on a return to growth. During 2022, we also continued work to integrate RU, which we acquired on September 1, 2021, including through certain restructuring activities.
Campus Expansions and Relocations
In October 2022, HCN opened a new campus in suburban Detroit. The campus is now enrolling PN students from the Detroit area. Additionally, effective in 2022, the Indiana State Board of Nursing approved an increase in the maximum enrollment at its Indianapolis campus to 200 students per calendar year as compared to 30 in 2021. In July 2022, RU opened a consolidated RU Hennepin/Anoka campus in Minnesota by merging two existing campuses and relocating to a new space. The campus offers over 55 career-focused programs across seven areas of study.
Insourcing of Marketing and Information Technology
RU has historically outsourced the vast majority of its information technology functions and marketing services through two contracts, one for each of marketing and information technology, with Collegis, LLC, or Collegis. In October 2022, RU and Collegis mutually agreed to the termination of the marketing services contract effective January 31, 2023. Outsourced information technology services under the Collegis information technology contract will continue through September 2024, when we intend to allow the contract to expire. We have completed the transition of RU marketing in-house to our centralized marketing team and plan to transition all of the information technology services currently outsourced to Collegis back to our operations or to one or more other third-party vendors.
Executive Leadership Changes
We made several changes and additions to our executive leadership team in 2022 with strategic hires aimed at bolstering our ability to deliver improved student experience and outcomes, accelerating growth and transformation, building human capital capabilities, and moving both APUS and RU into the future. New members of executive leadership team include a new Executive Vice President and Chief Experience Officer, a new Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer, a new Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, a new President of APUS, a new Acting President of RU, and a new Acting President for GSUSA. In addition, in January 2023, we announced a new President of GSUSA. Please refer to “Our Institutions and Our Operations – Information About our Executive Officers” below for additional information about our executive officers serving as of the date of this Annual Report. 
Financial Highlights
On December 28, 2022, we issued $40.0 million of Series A Senior Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, to affiliates of existing holders of our common stock.
In December 2022, we made prepayments totaling $65.0 million on our senior secured term loan facility, or the Term Loan. As a result of this prepayment, we will not be required to make any quarterly principal payments until payment of the outstanding principal amount at maturity in September 2027.
Financial Objectives 
We strive to build on the momentum created by our actions and achievements in fiscal 2022 and to continue to execute on our strategic plan. Specifically, we are focused broadly on (i) achieving public market scale by growing the revenue of our enterprise organically and inorganically and (ii) delivering improved enterprise-wide operating margins. 
Our Market and Competition
Market Characteristics
The overall U.S. postsecondary education market is large, with approximately 4,500 institutions of higher learning, diverse in its business models, and fragmented such that no one institution has a significant market share. Most postsecondary institutions, including for-profit postsecondary institutions, regardless of where they are located, how they are organized, or who they serve, face challenges, including:
•demand for relevance and return on investment, as they must prepare students with relevant skills to work in new and rapidly changing industries, respond to technological change, and support employers in efforts to optimize and advance their workforce;
•focus on quality and affordability, including via questions from potential students, lawmakers, the media, and others about the quality and cost of postsecondary education and the impact of poor quality and high costs;
•changes in consumer demands as prospective students look to unbundle their education and pursue credentials outside of degrees;
•a continually changing regulatory environment;
•the prospect of enrollment declines, with overall fall 2022 enrollment down 0.7 percent as compared to fall 2021 and significantly below 2019 levels; and 
•rapid technological transformation, including through increasing demand for online offerings and the utilization of technology to enhance student learning.
Competition
In addition to the characteristics outlined above, the U.S. postsecondary education market is characterized by intense competition. Competitive factors include, among other things:
•the quality of the academic program and alignment to high growth jobs;
•affordability;
•breadth of degree offerings;
•flexibility in delivery models;
•frequency of course or program starts;
•faculty experience;
•level of support for student success;
•career counseling and placement services;
•reputation;
•effectiveness in attracting college-ready students; and 
•compliance track record.
Institutions Serving Military Students
APUS has focused on serving the military community since its founding, and the community continues to be a primary source of APUS students. Approximately 2,500 institutions serve military students through participation in Department of Defense, or DoD, tuition assistance programs, or TA, including APUS. APUS’s primary competitors for military students are other institutions offering online instruction and colleges and universities offering on-campus instruction near military installations. 
We believe that APUS will continue to see competition in the military community from both not-for-profit and for-profit schools, as well as from the Armed Forces themselves, including through distance learning programs. For example, the Navy recently launched the U.S. Naval Community College, a community college supporting naval education for enlisted service members. As of November 2022, the U.S. Naval Community College had enrolled approximately 1,700 service members since March 2020 in two pilot programs, and it plans to eventually achieve the capability to accommodate up to 5,000 students. While a number of schools with which APUS competes are participating partners with the U.S. Naval Community College, as a for-profit institution, APUS is not an eligible partner. As traditional not-for-profit public and private schools advance online capabilities, we believe that they will also present increasing competition for APUS.
Nursing Programs
RU and HCN’s nursing programs are offered as campus-based programs in the geographic areas surrounding their campuses. In the approximately 20 market areas where RU and HCN’s combined 30 on-ground nursing campuses are located, we compete with a mix of community colleges, public and private postsecondary institutions, and other career-focused nursing colleges offering similar pre-licensure nursing programs. Because of the relatively local focus of these pre-licensure programs, our competitive environment is moderately fragmented and affected by various factors specific to the states and particular areas where campuses are located, including local supply and demand for nurses and nursing schools. We are also continuing to focus on growing our post-licensure programs, for which the competitive environment is less fragmented and has larger competitors, including because RN to BSN and other post-licensure degrees are available online, as well as in traditional campus-based environments.
Other Public and Postsecondary Institutions
Within the broader postsecondary education market, our institutions compete primarily with not-for-profit, public, and private two-year and four-year colleges, as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. Due to an increase in online postsecondary offerings, we could face increased competition as students pursue degree and credential-based postsecondary education from a wider selection of online offerings. For example, we anticipate increased competition from campus-based postsecondary institutions as they continue to increase online degree programs and develop more non-traditional programs. 
Most public institutions are aided by substantial government subsidies. Public and private not-for-profit institutions benefit from grants, tax-exemptions, contributions, and other financial resources not widely available to for-profit institutions. Many public competitors also benefit from longstanding name recognition and are able to directly recruit students in a more cost-effective manner, especially in their local markets. Many private institutions are able to make larger investments in marketing, including because they charge higher tuition.
Non-Traditional Competition
We also face competition from competing schools and others providing non-traditional education programs, often without charge or at low costs, including: 
•institutions offering competency-based education, or CBE, programs and single course or course packages aimed at credentialing outcomes rather than degree outcomes;
•corporate training and other companies partnering with universities or the federal government to offer alternative educational paths for students and the federal government workforce, respectively; 
•entities providing coding bootcamps or micro-credentials; and
•non-degree granting institutions such as massive online course, or MOOC, providers.
We believe that our institutions will continue to face new competition from non-traditional programs. 
For more information on competition within the postsecondary education market in which we compete, refer to “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Attracting and Retaining Students”.
Our Opportunities and Strengths
Our Opportunities
Active-Duty Military and Veterans
The U.S. military community will continue to be an important market segment for online education. We believe service members will continue to seek respected universities that provide military-focused support services coupled with an online curriculum and flexible scheduling. We believe service members are particularly interested in postsecondary credentials that offer both career advancement within the military and preparation for employment outside of the military. 
The U.S. military is demonstrating increased levels of support for credentials other than degrees. For example, Credentialing Opportunities On-Line, or COOL, is a program for each of the military branches and DoD civilians that links military occupations and experiences to civilian credentials (e.g., occupational certifications, licenses, and apprenticeships). The Army also offers an expanded credentialing program called the Army Credentialing Assistance Program, or Army CA, which is designed to support soldiers who wish to pursue civilian credentials, licenses, and certifications that may lead directly to a specific job. APUS is an approved training provider for Army CA. Service members using these programs may be eligible for assistance in paying for credentials, licenses, and certifications. Although utilization of our CA programs to date has been limited, we believe other service branches may follow the Army’s example or pursue other approaches to enhancing support for credentialing, including, for example, the Coast Guard’s CA Program, which has an annual combined cap on benefits higher than that of the Army. There are currently approximately 400 approved Army CA providers, none of which we believe have material market share.
We believe that military veterans represent another important addressable market for online education. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that in 2022 there were approximately 1.7 million veterans aged 18 to 34 and 4.6 million veterans aged 35 to 54. We believe that our military heritage, affordability, and online offerings are attractive to veterans. New policies and campaigns to facilitate the hiring of veterans may lower barriers to non-military jobs and facilitate veteran-owned businesses. As these policies and campaigns lower barriers to non-military jobs and facilitate veteran-owned businesses, we believe online universities offer valuable educational opportunities for veterans regardless of where they live, work, or learn.
Nursing
The expanding need for healthcare coupled with a nursing shortage is driving significant demand for nursing education. Projected employment for both registered nurses and licensed practical nurses is expected to grow by approximately 6% annually from 2021 to 2031, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook. When factoring in the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects more than 260,000 openings each year for registered nurses (203,200) and practical nurses (58,800) through 2031.
There is significant unmet demand from qualified students for nursing educational programs. Despite anticipated job opportunity growth, qualified applicants are not always accepted by nursing programs, primarily due to program selectivity, a shortage of clinical sites, faculty, and resource constraints. However, given the state and regulatory approvals necessary, investment in campuses, specialized programmatic knowledge and related accreditations, clinical placement requirements, time to receive approval to grow enrollments, and various standards that nursing schools must meet, we believe there are challenges for new entrants to nursing education. We also believe we may distinguish ourselves from our competitors by developing direct partnerships with healthcare providers as they become more involved in educating and training their future workforces, of which nurses are the largest segment.
Career Learning
U.S. employers are increasingly reporting significant gaps between required skills and the capabilities of their workforce. Working adults also recognize the need to be lifelong learners. We believe employers and professional associations will seek partnerships with academic institutions to advance the skills and productivity of their workforce through higher education and career learning programs, which we see as an opportunity, particularly for APUS, RU, and GSUSA. We also believe that there is an opportunity to expand the APU brand more broadly to attract students beyond its historical constituency.
Our Competitive Strengths
Return on Educational Investment and Affordability
Our institutions are committed to continually assessing and enhancing our academic programs and student services to offer a high-quality education and facilitate successful outcomes for our students and graduates that align with employer needs. In addition, as described in “Our Institutions and Operations – Human Capital” below, our institutions focus on excellence by hiring experienced faculty and continuing to develop their capabilities. 
Providing affordable degree and certificate programs is an important element of our competitive strategy. The combined tuition and fees at APUS are generally less than the average in-state cost at a public university. APUS’s low tuition and fees, in combination with APUS-funded tuition grants and book grants provided to all undergraduate students, and active-duty military students and their spouses and dependents at the master’s level, result in significant savings and mean that APUS students are not required to take on as much debt as they might at another institution. APUS’s generous transfer credit policy, and use of open educational resources, further reduce a student’s out-of-pocket costs.
Tuition and fees at RU and HCN are also designed to be affordable and competitive when compared with those of similar institutions offering the same level of flexibility, accessibility, and student experience. RU students may also lower their total cost of attendance through self-directed assessments, which provide savings by permitting students who demonstrate proficiency in a subject to test out of courses. Similarly, HCN students may apply performance-based grants and needs-based grants toward the balance of their tuition. Please refer to “Our Institutions and Operations – Our Institutions – Affordability and Cost of Attendance” below.
We believe that, given broad concerns about rising tuition and student loan debt in higher education, there are opportunities to create awareness and attract college-ready students with the primary message of affordability and value, in order to help achieve a Higher Education Return on Investment for our Customers, or HEROICTM.
Relevant Offerings Aligned with Demand
Our institutions offer programs aligned to jobs that U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data and non-governmental organizations have indicated as high growth areas. Our institutions are also committed to continually assessing and enhancing our academic programs and student services to offer a high-quality education and facilitate successful outcomes for our students and graduates that align with employer needs. The depth and breadth of APUS’s and RU’s non-nursing program offerings are designed to effectively address the diverse needs of students who enter into education programs with vastly different educational and career backgrounds and goals. APUS also utilizes Industry Advisory Councils to evaluate its current curriculum and determine the career relevance of programs and degrees, which facilitate efforts to connect APUS’s curriculum to the industries and the students it serves and to deliver a high-quality academic product. RU and HCN, meanwhile, create new nurses to meet the significant imbalance of supply and demand that exists for nurses by preparing and training nursing students to enter the nursing profession as licensed nurses. 
Flexible Program Offerings
Our institutions offer flexible learning modalities to meet the needs of busy working adults. APUS offers online delivery with monthly starts and academic support offerings are individualized to students’ needs, while RU offers CBE programs, a blend of online and in person courses for their nursing and other healthcare-related programs, and flexible start dates and online courses for other programs. HCN offers programs that accommodate working adults by offering blended online and in-person courses for the PN and ADN programs, as well as daytime and evening/weekend options. GSUSA offers virtual and in-person instructor-led, blended, and on demand online courses to accommodate the need for immediate application-specific training.
Market Leadership
Our status as a market leader in key areas we serve means that we operate from a position of strength. APUS is the number one educator of active-duty military and of veterans. Since its founding, APUS has broadened its focus to include other military communities, veterans, and public service and service-minded communities, with a focus on a broad purpose of “educating those who serve.” As of December 31, 2022, approximately 65% of APUS’s students self-reported that they served in the military on active-duty at the time of initial enrollment, and approximately 11% of APUS’s students self-reported that they are a military veteran. We are also the largest educator of ADN and PN pre-licensure nurses in the United States. RU has more than 7,600 nursing students at its 22 campuses across six states and online with over 90% of those students pursuing a pre-licensure PN Degree, ADN Degree, or post-licensure BSN. RU enrolls the largest number of ADN students in the United States and, together with HCN’s nearly 2,600 nursing students, we have the largest population of PN and ADN students in the country. Finally, we are one of the largest providers of training to the federal and public employee workforces through GSUSA with its extensive portfolio of government agency customers and directly enrolled federal government employees.
Expansive Nursing Footprint
Our institutions train nurses online and at 30 campuses across nine states and also offer online programs. Given the state and regulatory approvals necessary, the investment in physical campus facilities, the specialized programmatic knowledge and related accreditations, clinical placement requirements, the time to receive approval to grow nursing enrollments and various standards that nursing schools must meet, we believe nursing education – and in particular first or pre-licensure nursing education – provides us with opportunities to distinguish ourselves from our competitors. In addition, we believe we are one of the only educators with a full “ladder” of nursing curriculum from PN to Doctoral degree. 
Our Business Strategy and Goals
Win with Service-Minded Students
At our core is a recognition of the importance of individuals who serve the country and society at large. We aim to deliver on our vision of education that transforms lives, advances careers, and improves communities by “educating those who serve.” Our institutions are purpose-built to educate the service-minded student by offering programs designed to prepare individuals for contributions to their profession and society and to provide opportunities to advance students in their current professions or help them prepare for their next career.
We seek to offer curriculum in bundles that resonate with service-minded students. We expect to continue to focus on education that provides real skills and pathways to employment and career advancement in fields that align with demand. We aim to deliver differentiated, memorable learner experiences across the entire student journey.
Deliver a Return on Higher Education Investment
We seek to maximize a student’s return on their educational investment. We believe learners are looking for a practical solution that provides value in return for their educational investment and that fits their lifestyle and values. We believe there are opportunities to create awareness and attract college-ready students with the primary message of affordability and value. 
Grow a National Nursing Platform
We are focused on expanding nursing opportunities through geographic campus expansion and the expansion of our programs and course offerings. This focus includes expansion of our post-licensure enrollments, particularly at RU where key post-licensure programs have already been established and are primarily delivered online, which represents an opportunity for our alumni and other already-licensed nurses to advance their nursing careers. We also seek to enhance provider partnerships to act as a catalyst for enrollment growth and defray student costs. We intend to continue to seek opportunities for both organic and inorganic growth, including by exploring acquisitions of other nursing schools.
Build a Career Learning Platform
We believe that our institutions provide us with a foundation from which we can build a career learning platform. We intend to expand GSUSA into new domains and models. We seek to grow and expand nursing provider partnerships such as the one HCN entered into in the fourth quarter of 2022 with a large national healthcare provider to provide tuition sponsorship in 
exchange for a work commitment. Among our institutions’ offerings are certificate programs, credentialing, and CBE programs.
Transform the Company to Achieve Sustainable Growth
We aim to increase our public market scale by growing the revenue and expanding operating margins of the enterprise organically and inorganically. We intend to develop capabilities to drive organic growth and plan to continue to assess and pursue strategic investments and acquisitions and integrate and grow them for inorganic growth. Our strategy is organized around areas where we believe we have “the right to win.” For example, we will continue to focus on being the top educator for active-duty military and veterans and pre-licensure nurses. We also aim to deliver improved enterprise-wide operating margins by continuing to exercise financial discipline and taking steps such as our efforts focused on realigning our organizational structure, eliminating redundancies, and optimizing certain functions. 
Optimize Our Cost Structure Through the Shared Services Model
We aim to drive better, faster, more cost effective, responsible, scalable results for our institutions by delivering shared services to them, as noted in “Our Institutions and Operations” below. We believe that the shared services model promotes the efficient use of resources.
OUR INSTITUTIONS AND OPERATIONS
    We provide postsecondary education through three educational institutions of higher learning: APUS, RU, and HCN. We also provide career learning to the federal government workforce through GSUSA. Each institution is primarily responsible for its own academic mission, while APEI performs certain business functions on a shared basis for the benefit of APUS, RU, HCN, and GSUSA, with the capability to further expand these shared services to these entities. We believe that the shared services model promotes the efficient use of resources.
Our Institutions
Programs and Areas of Study
We offer a total of 184 degree programs, 138 certificate programs, and four diploma programs, through our institutions. We offer programs across a broad range of fields of study, including public service-focused fields such as nursing, national security, military studies, intelligence, and homeland security, as well as traditional academic fields such as business, health science, information technology, justice studies, education, and liberal arts. In addition, through GSUSA, our offerings also include career learning opportunities in leadership, finance, human resources, and other fields of study critical to the federal government workforce.

General Academics
APUS offers 136 degree programs and 115 certificate programs. More than 1,800 distinct courses are available in either eight- or sixteen-week formats. Most APUS academic terms begin on the first Monday of each month. APUS’ certificate programs generally require a minimum of 18 credit hours and focus on a particular component of a broader degree program. Among those programs are 16 undergraduate and 16 graduate NanoCerts programs, focused programs comprised of three academic courses in a related area of interest that provide skills necessary for career or professional development and result in a micro credential. RU offers over 60 programs across six schools of study in addition to nursing. RU offers more than 800 distinct courses in 5.5 or 11-week formats with terms beginning in January, April, July, and October of each year.
 Nursing
RU offers a comprehensive “ladder” of nursing degrees including a pre-licensure Diploma in PN, an ADN, and a BSN, as well as the post-licensure RN to BSN, Master of Science in Nursing and Doctorate of Nurse Practice. In addition, RU also offers a post-graduate nursing certificate. HCN offers on-campus instruction leading to a Diploma in PN and an ADN, as well as a Direct Entry ADN option that offers an accelerated graduation pathway for students who meet certain transfer, academic and entrance exam requirements. Portions of the programs are taught online. Academic terms for HCN’s PN and ADN programs begin four times each year, with courses starting in January, April, July, and October. Graduates of RU and HCN’s PN and ADN programs are eligible to seek licensure after passing the applicable National Council Licensure Examination, or NCLEX, exams. 
Government Training
GSUSA offers professional development and training courses for federal government agencies and the federal government workforce, serving organizations and individuals with programs designed to support organizational missions, career and occupational development, and the personal ambitions of adult learners. GSUSA’s offerings include more than 300 courses across 14 program areas. 
Student Body
Overall, our institutions have approximately 107,100 students enrolled online and at 30 campuses across nine states, with enrollment calculated differently depending on the institution. In addition, GSUSA trained over 25,000 individuals in 2022.
The student body of APUS consists of approximately 88,900 enrolled students, most of whom are employed full-time. Student enrollment is defined as the number of unique active students, including those who take an approved leave of absence, who are currently attending a course or have completed at least one course within the last 12 months. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 65% of APUS’s students self-reported that they served in the military on active-duty at the time of initial enrollment, and approximately 11% of APUS’s students self-reported that they are a military veteran. The remainder of APUS’s students are other military or military-affiliated professionals (such as reservists or National Guard members), public service professionals (such as law enforcement personnel or other first responders), and other non-military students (such as working adult students and military spouses). Many APUS students have significant prior education and career experiences; 90% are working adults and the average age of APUS students is 31. APUS is designed to serve those adult learners with tailored offerings to support them in successfully reaching their individual goals.
RU provides education to approximately 15,600 enrolled students. Student enrollment is defined as the number of unique active students, including those who take an approved leave of absence. RU offers programs across a broad range of fields of study, but recent years have seen an increased focus on healthcare, specifically nursing education. At RU, 75% of students are over the age of 25 and 86% are female. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 7,600 students are pursuing nursing degrees at RU, over 90% of whom are enrolled in RU’s pre-licensure degree programs. 
HCN provides nursing education to approximately 2,600 students at six campuses in Ohio, one campus in Indianapolis, and one in suburban Detroit. The average HCN student is approximately 32 years old and 93% of HCN students are female.
Accreditation
Our institutions have institutional accreditation and their programs often have programmatic or specialized accreditation. Institutional accreditation is an important attribute of our institutions. Colleges and universities depend, in part, on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Students and sponsors of tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for quality assurance, and employers rely on institutions’ accredited status when evaluating a candidate’s credentials. APUS and RU have institutional accreditation from HLC with an Open Pathway designation, which affords institutions greater opportunity to pursue institutional improvement projects than the alternative Standard Pathway designation. HCN is institutionally accredited by ABHES. GSUSA is accredited by ACCET.
In addition to institutional accreditation, certain of our programs offered have received specialized accreditation. For example, the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs, or ACBSP, accredits approximately 15 different business-focused academic programs offered by APUS, and accredits APUS’s accounting program under a specialized accounting accreditation. The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, or CCNE, accredits the Bachelor and Master of Science in Nursing programs. Certain programs offered by RU have received specialized accreditation as well. For example, RU’s ADN and Licensed Practical Nursing programs are accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Education in Nursing. The BSN and Master of Science in Nursing degree programs at RU are accredited by CCNE. HCN’s PN program is accredited by the National League for Nursing Commission for Nursing Education Accreditation, or NLN CNEA.
RU and HCN’s locations and programs are approved by state agencies as well. For example, the nursing education programs offered by RU and HCN are approved by the relevant state boards of nursing.
For more information on accreditation and licensure, please refer to “Regulatory Environment – Accreditation” and “Regulatory Environment – State Authorization/Licensure” in this Annual report.
Admissions and Admissions Standards
We work to attract students who are more likely to persist and succeed in our programs and continue to work to identify and implement changes and initiatives in an effort to attract and enroll more college-ready students more effectively. We welcome students to apply for admission at any time through online application processes at APUS, HCN, and RU. The current qualification for most undergraduate programs is a high school diploma or General Education Development certificate. Applicants for graduate programs must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited U.S. institution or an equivalent foreign institution. Certain programs may have additional admissions standards and restrictions.
Affordability and Cost of Attendance
We have long been focused on offering our students affordable programs. Affordable tuition has been a priority of APUS since its founding. APUS tuition remains among the lowest in the four-year for-profit sector. The combined tuition and fees at APUS are generally less than the average in-state cost at a public university. APUS costs are about 25% less than the average in-state full-time undergraduate tuition, fees, and books at four-year public universities, based on the final 2021-2022 institutional data reported to the U.S. Department of Education through The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. This low tuition and fees, in combination with APUS-funded tuition grants and book grants provided to all undergraduate students, and to active-duty military students and their spouses and dependents at the master’s level, result in significant savings. Additionally, APUS's generous transfer credit policy, and use of open educational resources, further reduce a student’s out-of-pocket costs. Tuition and fees at RU and HCN are also designed to be affordable and competitive with those of similar institutions. 
Tuition and Fees
At APUS, tuition for undergraduate courses is $285 per credit hour, tuition for master’s level classes is $370 per credit hour, and there is a technology fee of either $65 or $100 per course, depending on the course. In general, a bachelor’s degree may be earned for $34,200 in tuition costs at current tuition rates, and APUS master’s degrees may be earned for $13,320 in tuition at current tuition rates. APUS does not charge an admission fee or fees for services such as registration, course drops, or similar events that trigger fees at many other institutions. Because APUS is an exclusively online institution, there are no required resident fees, such as for parking, food service, student union, and recreation. APUS charges students a technology fee but provides a grant to cover the technology fee for students using TA. When applicable, APUS students are charged certain additional fees, such as graduation, late registration, transcript request, and comprehensive examination fees. APUS plans to adopt modest tuition and fee increases effective in the second quarter of 2023, with a corresponding increase in grants to military students.
RU’s costs vary among its programs and between part-time and full-time attendance. RU’s ADN program typically costs $409 per credit hour in addition to course fees. Credit hour costs range from $199 per credit hour to $419 per credit hour for other undergraduate programs. At the graduate level, RU offers five different master’s programs for $260 per credit hour or less. RU charges a $175 course technology and resource fee for each course. Students may purchase required textbooks or e-books through RU for a flat fee of $15 for each textbook (traditional or e-book) for each course. RU adopted modest tuition increases, which took effect on January 3, 2023, for select programs to help offset the increased costs of delivering a quality education.
HCN’s costs vary among its programs. HCN’s PN program may be completed for approximately $18,600 in tuition and fees and the ADN program may be completed for approximately $26,400 in tuition and fees, depending on the campus location. Fees include the cost of examination review materials, lab fees, and test review fees, among others. Some of these costs are payable to HCN and others are payable to third parties. HCN’s students also incur costs for textbooks, supplies, uniforms, and its technology package. These costs vary by program and are paid for by HCN’s students as the textbooks or supplies are needed. HCN estimates that over the life of its programs, a student’s costs related to textbooks and supplies will be approximately $4,000 for the PN program and $6,000 for the ADN program. HCN plans to implement a 5% increase in tuition and fees effective in the second quarter of 2023 across all programs.
Grants and Other Fee Reduction Opportunities 
To support APUS’s active-duty military students using TA, APUS provides an APUS-funded tuition grant so that undergraduate and master’s students who are eligible for TA benefits and their spouses and dependents have a net tuition of $250 per credit hour, which is the same amount as covered by TA and, when combined with the APUS funded book grant described below, means that active-duty military utilizing TA may attain an undergraduate or master’s degree at APUS for no out-of-pocket cost. APUS’s tuition grant applied to approximately 71% of its total net course registrations in 2022. In addition, 
veterans who qualify for 100% of their Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, or Post-9/11 GI Bill, benefits are expected to generally have no out-of-pocket expenses either.
Undergraduate students and all active-duty military students and their spouses and dependents enrolled in courses for academic credit at APUS receive textbooks and certain course materials at no additional cost to them through an APUS-funded institutional book-grant program. APUS also utilizes open access and online library materials where appropriate and works with various publishers to reduce the cost of textbooks and course materials for both graduate students who pay for textbooks and course materials and for APUS who funds the book grant. 
At RU, students can lower their total cost of attendance through self-directed assessments, which provide savings by permitting students who demonstrate proficiency in a subject to test out of courses. Self-directed assessments, when available, may be attempted for a prepaid fee, which is generally $149 per attempt.
HCN students may apply performance-based grants and needs-based grants toward the balance of their tuition. HCN offers an institutional affordability grant to students demonstrating financial need to cover the difference between the total cost of tuition and fees less the amount of all eligible financial aid resources. The grant is designed to limit a student’s monthly payment to $200 through an award of up to $200 per month, or $600 per term after consideration of financial aid, employer tuition reimbursement, and other financial resources.
RU and HCN both offer their students an extended payment plan option. The extended payment plans are designed to assist students with educational costs including tuition and fees. Payment plans require ongoing payments while the student is enrolled in a program and extend after the last day of attendance or graduation. To the extent interest is applied, it is generally fixed and does not accrue until the student departs the program or graduates. The extended payment plan options do not impose any origination fees. 
Sources of Student Financing and Financial Aid
Our students finance their education through a combination of individual resources, ED’s Title IV programs, private loans, state and federal grants, institutional grants, TA, Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, educational benefits, and corporate reimbursement programs. Most students rely on some form of financial aid in addition to their individual resources. At APUS, students utilizing DoD’s TA programs accounted for 47%, those using VA education benefits 21%, and those utilizing ED’s Title IV programs 18% of net course registrations in 2022. We believe that the ability of our students to participate in these programs is essential to APUS’s success. At RU, students utilizing ED’s Title IV programs as their primary source of payment accounted for approximately 74%, those utilizing state grants, cash, or private/alternative loans accounted for approximately 24%, and those using VA education benefits approximately 2% in 2022. In addition, most HCN students rely on some form of financial aid in addition to their individual resources.
Participation in TA, VA education benefits, and Title IV programs adds to our institutions’ regulatory burden and results in increased regulatory scrutiny, as described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment – Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements”. Federal legislative activity and actions by ED, DoD, and VA may adversely impact the ability of our students to obtain tuition financing, which as with any other limitations on tuition financing could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our financial condition, as described more fully below in “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business”.
Student Retention and Academic Outcomes
Our institutions are focused on executing initiatives that will more effectively support their students and help improve those students’ educational outcomes. Improved engagement is an important element in our goal of retaining qualified students. For example, APUS and RU improve engagement through, among other things, faculty engagement initiatives and co-curricular initiatives to increase the level of engagement and collaboration in the classroom and strengthen the bond between those institutions and their students. We also carry out initiatives intended to improve the educational outcomes of our students. For example, RU recently established a Center of Nursing Excellence that is dedicated to helping students pass the NCLEX exam the first time by identifying student-specific challenge areas and providing customized tutoring resources and faculty training to help shore up gaps in student knowledge. RU plans to integrate NCLEX testing simulation and preparation tools throughout the curriculum and to conduct a curriculum assessment to identify areas where RU can better enable student mastery and success.
Career Development
We believe assisting students in advancing their careers in their current profession or securing employment after completion of their programs or courses is an essential part of our mission. Our institutions offer an array of career services, including complementary personalized career advice for students and alumni through direct interaction with career services staff, career events such as in-person and virtual job fairs and on-campus recruiting, and institution-sponsored online job boards. APUS also offers career planning tools, such as an interest assessment to identify career options that fit student interests and guides to careers associated with student majors, and career preparation services, such as mock interview services, resume review services, and social media review services to improve students’ employer-facing online profiles. RU provides a variety of self-service resources, including access to a networking, job posting, a career research website, online resume building and interview preparation tools, webinars, and video tutorials, as well as online programmatic advising by dedicated career services advisors. We strive to link students directly with employers where we can. For example, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, HCN entered into a partnership with a large national healthcare provider to assist certain HCN students in funding their tuition costs. The healthcare provider is fully funding the tuition costs of students it selects from HCN’s ADN program at its HCN’s Toledo, Ohio campus in exchange for the students agreeing to work for the provider for an agreed time period following graduation. We plan to launch additional healthcare partnerships for RU and HCN in 2023.
Marketing and Branding 
We strive to align our marketing efforts with our business and strategy and to tailor our marketing approach to our educational offerings and the students we serve. This approach encompasses all our learning modalities, from online to on-campus to hybrid, and all our educational outcomes, from certification to degree, and leading to the career outcomes students seek after they leave us. As part of these efforts, we continue to highlight certain key marketing and branding messages that align with our strategy, including educating those who serve, affordability and value.
We execute our marketing efforts through both direct-to-student and business-to-business channels. Our marketing relationship with students extends across the entire student journey from recruitment to post-graduation and includes efforts to drive student awareness, improve student onboarding, increase persistence, improve student performance, and focus on career outcomes. We aim to market to students wherever they may be, through their chosen media or marketing channel, and in the geographies where they are located. Our approach includes in-person and relationship-based marketing as well as digital (including search, company-owned and external content, and social media), and more traditional television, radio, and print marketing efforts. 
We also work with partners we believe can provide us with better access to the students we aim to reach. Almost 30% of our RU enrollments are associated with a partner relationship. We have agreements with more than 260 employers whose employees pursue an education at RU. Additionally, we provide more than 130 APUS partner organizations with services to maximize strategic workforce development goals. This includes partnerships with community colleges, which prepare students for transfer opportunities to APUS for bachelor’s degree programs. We also have begun establishing new partnerships with healthcare providers to further career outcomes and defray costs of education, as discussed more fully in “Our Institutions – Career Development” above. 
Marketing efforts tailored for our institutions consider prospective and current students, including their respective educational goals. To that end, APUS marketing has historically had a relationship-based aspect focused on building long-term relationships with businesses, professional organizations, and individuals in the military, military-affiliated, and public service communities. We also have programs at APUS that aim to assist members of the military as they transition into private sector jobs. RU and HCN nursing program marketing includes leveraging relationships with and marketing to the healthcare community, and in late 2022 we increased our non-nursing marketing for RU in response to demand. 
In 2022, we began efforts to centralize our marketing organization. Our centralized team is currently providing all marketing and branding services for APUS and GSUSA and providing many of these services for HCN. RU historically relied on Collegis for a variety of outsourced marketing services. In October 2022, RU and Collegis mutually agreed to the termination of the marketing services contract effective January 31, 2023, and we have completed the transition of RU marketing in-house to our centralized marketing team. We are also developing marketing expertise that spans a variety of functional areas and to extend our use of marketing technology and analytics. We currently use technology and analytics to improve marketing mix, audience targeting, new initiatives, messaging, and creative decisions, as well as advertising development, delivery, and testing.
Information Technology
    Information technology systems are essential to our student experience and our business operations. APEI provides information technology services to APUS, RU, HCN, and GSUSA through a shared services model. In addition, RU is party to a service agreement with Collegis to provide information technology services through September 2024. RU currently relies on Collegis for a variety of outsourced information technology functions, including data center, learning management system, user support, and network and voice services, and its technology infrastructure is currently hosted, managed, and supported by Collegis. 
Our Ongoing Technology Transformation 
We are in the midst a multi-year technology transformation program to enable us to enhance the learning experience for students, to better accommodate new flexible learning modalities, and to improve the operational effectiveness of our enterprise. We are also currently migrating key applications, systems, and data to the cloud rather than hosting in our own co-located data centers. With the recent acquisitions of RU and GSUSA, we are developing and executing plans to incorporate these institutions into this transformation program as well, and looking for ways to incorporate their systems, infrastructure, and processes into our standard technology stack. 
In April 2022, we notified Collegis that we intend to permit RU’s contract with Collegis to expire by its terms in September 2024. We plan to insource all of the technology and services currently provided by Collegis or to cloud services or third-party vendors over which we will have management oversight. As part of the transition away from Collegis, we plan to look more broadly for opportunities further improve operational effectiveness across our information technology operations and for opportunities to rationalize our technology portfolio to create a more consistent, standardized technology stack.
Student Information and Instructional Delivery
Our core enterprise systems are (i) our student information and services systems, or SIS, platforms which our institutions use to interact with and provide support to students in areas such as admissions, registration, tuition payment, grade reporting, progress toward degrees, and various other functions, and (ii) our learning management system, or LMS, platforms, which our institutions use to deliver course content and support teaching, learning, and collaboration.
We have a legacy customized SIS at APUS that we refer to as Partnership At a Distance™, or PAD, and proprietary information systems and processes to support PAD, into which we have invested significant time and money. PAD is designed to enable APUS to provide each student with individualized support at appropriate times from pre-enrollment through and beyond graduation, including student advising, administrative support, and community networking. We continually evaluate PAD for possible changes and upgrades and anticipate that we will eventually make significant changes to or replace this system. RU uses Anthology Campus Nexus as its SIS. The RU SIS environment is currently hosted with Collegis, which maintains all systems, support, and hosting. RU’s and APUS’s admissions function are managed inside of Salesforce and connected to Anthology for RU and PAD for APUS to ensure all pertinent information is synchronized appropriately. HCN and GSUSA currently have their own SIS platforms, but we plan to consolidate the separate platforms used by HCN and GSUSA to a standard platform for those institutions beginning in 2024. More broadly, we continue to review and assess our student information and services platforms and their capabilities, including whether to consolidate to a standard platform across more or all of our institutions.
In 2021, we completed work to consolidate HCN and APUS onto a single, cloud-based LMS platform, Brightspace by D2L. RU uses Blackboard Ultra as its LMS platform. This environment is hosted with Blackboard, which is now owned by Anthology. All RU support for Blackboard Ultra is currently provided by Collegis.
In addition to our student information and services systems and our LMS platforms, we also have several other systems that support the student experience, financial aid processing, financial management, human resources processes, marketing, and decision support. We are continuing to consolidate APUS’s customer relationship management systems onto a single platform, the first phases of which were completed in 2022. In early 2023, we will be launching a new native mobile application to improve the student experience at APUS. 
Our Information Technology Infrastructure 
The backbone of our information technology infrastructure currently consists of two co-location data centers. Our technology environment is managed internally and through a third-party managed service provider. Student access to our systems is provided through redundant data carriers. RU’s network is fully redundant through a software-defined wide area 
network infrastructure. We intend to continue to migrate much of our infrastructure and core applications to a cloud computing model with the goal of improving the reliability, scalability, agility, and security of our core infrastructure and applications.
Our Information Security Efforts
The performance, reliability, and security of the networks and technology infrastructure we use or rely on is critical to our operations, our institutions’ reputation, and our ability to attract and retain students. As such, we have a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer in addition to our Chief Information Officer, and our Board of Directors reviews our cybersecurity and other information technology risks and our plans to mitigate them. In 2022, we hired additional information security employees and implemented 24x7 security monitoring by a third-party service provider. We use external vendors to perform security assessments on a periodic basis to review and assess our information security and utilize this information to audit ourselves, to monitor the security of our technology infrastructure, and to assess whether and how to prioritize the allocation of scarce resources to protect data and systems. We also require third-party vendors to maintain a level of security that is acceptable to us and work closely with vendors to address potential and actual security concerns and attacks. 
For more information on our information technology investments and their effects on our results of operations, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview”, and for more information regarding risks related to our information technology, refer to “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Technology Infrastructure.”
Human Capital 
Strategy and Values
Our ability to deliver on our Company mission and to continue to transform our enterprise to focus on quality student outcomes, and on sustainable growth is tightly aligned with our human capital strategy. Our performance depends on the talents, experience, and efforts of our employees, and on our ability to foster a culture and practice of high performance, innovation, cooperation, integrity, and respect. We seek to be a destination for high-potential employees and desire to build a bench of future leaders by developing best-in-class human capital capabilities. During 2022, our key human capital efforts focused on centralizing our human capital function, implementing a common talent acquisition methodology, and improving responses to human capital inquiries. We also began implementing a streamlined and proactive approach to employee communication to drive connectivity, engagement, and efficiencies.
As of December 31, 2022, APEI’s employee population comprised the following:

 | Faculty Members (Full-Time) | Other Professional Staff (Full-Time) | | Total Full-Time Employees | | Faculty Members (Part-Time) | | Other Professional Staff (Part-Time) | | Total
APUS | 338 | 530 | | 868 | | | 1,343 | | | 9 | | | 2,220 | 
RU | 293 | 453 | | 746 | | | 1,911 | | | 273 | | | 2,930 | 
HCN | 112 | 142 | | 254 | | | 70 | | | 27 | | | 351 | 
GSUSA | — | | 56 | | 56 | | | 230 | | | 17 | | | 303 | 
Corporate | — | | 433 | | 433 | | | — | | | 7 | | | 440 | 
Total | 743 | | 1,614 | | | 2,357 | | | 3,554 | | | 333 | | | 6,244

Our employees have diverse backgrounds, influenced in part by the geography in which our headquarters, administrative facilities, and campuses are located, and by the communities we serve, in particular nursing, military, military-affiliated, and veteran communities. 
As of December 31, 2022, our employee diversity was as follows:

 | Female (1) | | People of Color (2)
APUS | 54 | % | | 22 | %
RU | 80 | % | | 31 | %
HCN | 75 | % | | 26 | %
GSUSA | 52 | % | | 42 | %
Corporate | 57 | % | | 25 | %

(1) Consists of employees self-identifying as female.
(2) Consists of employees self-identifying as Black or African American, Hispanic, Asian American, Native American, or more than one race.
Diversity and inclusion are at the core of our values, and we believe that reflects the expectations of students we serve. In the first quarter of 2023, we launched an enterprise-wide, cross-functional Inclusion and Impact Council that includes members of executive leadership and focuses on driving awareness and harmonization around diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives. To support our diversity and inclusion efforts, we also have diversity and inclusion task forces and committees at our institutions. 
Talent Development and Retention
We believe the quality of our faculty and non-faculty staff is critical to the student experience and student outcomes and is therefore vital to our institutions’ success. Hiring competition is intense, especially for faculty in specialized areas and qualified executives. RU and HCN also compete with both nursing schools and traditional employers of healthcare professionals to fill open faculty positions. A nursing faculty shortage continues, adversely affecting our ability to recruit and retain qualified nursing faculty at RU and HCN. We believe that current job market dynamics, including low unemployment, have further increased the challenge of hiring and employee retention. Overall, turnover of our employees during 2022 increased when compared to 2021. Excluding RU and GSUSA, which were not part of the organization for all of 2021, turnover in 2022 increased approximately 14% to 24%, depending on segment. For 2022, 8.3% of full-time employee terminations were voluntary and 19.6% were involuntary. Turnover in 2021 was approximately 6% to 10% higher than in 2020, depending on segment. Although we have taken additional steps to retain our current faculty and source and recruit talent, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful.
Our strategic initiatives require our personnel to perform at a high level and to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. New faculty members complete on-boarding, orientation, and training. All faculty have annual development opportunities and requirements. In addition, our institutions regularly review faculty performance. We have implemented a centralized talent and transformation team to focus on improving internal learning and development practices and succession planning to ensure that we cultivate skills needed to deliver high quality student outcomes and help grow our operations. In 2022, we invested in both change management and integration talent at the Company level to assist in further integrating our institutions, and we implemented a consistent compliance training approach across the organization. We are committed to working to ensure that new hires and employees are fully trained on key compliance issues in a timely manner, and we review all required compliance trainings to ensure the training is comprehensive.
Staffing our Institutions
We believe that hiring and retaining well-educated and qualified faculty members is important to our success. We have centralized more of our talent acquisition function in an effort to improve talent search efficiency, increase the consistency of our sourcing practices, and strengthen hiring processes. This centralization and new leadership has significantly reduced our time to fill metrics and improved our ability to assess talent needs company-wide. Within the first six months after centralizing hiring for all staff across APEI, APUS, RU, and GSUSA and all faculty at RU, the average time to fill new positions decreased by 28%.
At APUS, approximately 65% of our full-time faculty have a terminal degree in their field of study, and virtually all undergraduate faculty members hold graduate degrees. At RU and HCN, all nursing faculty have earned a BSN or higher. Many APUS faculty members have relevant experience at other universities and within military, corporate, and government 
institutions. In addition to having the necessary educational requirements, RU and HCN seek faculty members who have demonstrated experience in the field of nursing. 
Employee Engagement and Relations
We measure employee engagement, including faculty, on an ongoing basis by soliciting feedback, including a company-wide engagement survey for all employees in 2022, in order to understand the views of our employees. The results from engagement surveys are used to implement programs and processes designed to enhance employee engagement and improve the employee and faculty experience. None of our employees are parties to a collective bargaining agreement, and management considers employee relations to be good.
Health and Safety
We are committed to the health and well-being of our employees and assess our well-being initiatives and marketplace trends on an ongoing basis. Beginning in 2022, we began to increase our focus on employee well-being. For example, we enlarged our Total Rewards Team, which is focused on benefits and well-being, we harmonized paid-time off policies across the Company, and we started quarterly benefits town hall meetings hosted by executive leadership. In 2023, we added paid parental leave to support our employees and their families and as an additional retention tool.
Since the abatement of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have allowed employees to return to a hybrid work setting, and we continue monitoring guidelines and regulations and updating our policies accordingly. Employees are continuing to follow a blended model of working onsite and remotely, and we have committed to determining the optimal mix of site-based, flexible, and fully remote work models on a department and role basis. 
Driven in part by the immediate need to respond to the impact from Hurricane Ian, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we began developing a new company-wide disaster response protocol in an effort to ensure smooth execution of assistance, recovery efforts, and leadership response focused not just on operational matters, but on supporting our employees.
Community Impact
We intend for our Inclusion and Impact Council to lead efforts to ensure that we positively impact the communities in which our employees work and live, including by organizing volunteer opportunities. Beginning in 2023, we are providing full-time employees, faculty, and staff with eight hours of additional paid time off for volunteering and giving back to society.

Intellectual Property 
We and our institutions own and exercise rights associated with patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, agreements, and registrations to protect our intellectual property.
Our institutions own all course syllabi and course and instructional materials developed by their faculty and employees and, as such, these course materials may be used by our institutions in current and future courses as needed to facilitate instruction and may be modified by our institutions to meet evolving course or curriculum requirements. In general, our institutions do not assert ownership claims to scholarly works of their faculty, such as articles and books, which were not developed as course materials. Such intellectual property of our institutions’ individual faculty members remains the property of each such faculty member and is reserved specifically for use only by the faculty member who owns it unless the faculty member grants permission for use by others. 
Our institutions rely on agreements under which they obtain rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third-party content providers. Our institutions own the copyright for a work by a faculty member where there has been express agreement on such ownership, if the institutions compensated the faculty member for the particular product, or if the institutions funded the research in whole or in part.
We or our institutions have secured or claim rights to trademarks for various names and terms used in our and their respective businesses, including rights in “American Public Education, Inc.,” “American Public University System,” “American Military University,” “American Public University,” “Rasmussen University” and others. In connection with our acquisition of HCN, we received a royalty-free, irrevocable, exclusive, transferable, sublicensable license to use the name “Hondros College of Nursing” and, instead of “Nursing,” any other qualifier directly related to nursing, medicine, or healthcare in connection with the business and operations of HCN. The trademarks and service marks we use are central to our institutions’ brand identities overall and marketing efforts, including how prospective students identify them. 
Our institutions also own rights to internet domain names pertaining to their brand names and other unique descriptors. We and our institutions vigorously defend against infringement of intellectual property rights, including trademarks, service marks and copyrights.
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
We experience fluctuations in quarterly results and, therefore, the results in any quarter may not represent the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or full year. Operating results fluctuate as a result of seasonal or other variations in enrollments. For example, historically, across our institutions, our enrollments are higher in the fall term when students traditionally start their education. Our student population also varies as a result of new enrollments, graduations, student attrition, the success of our marketing programs, and other reasons that we cannot always anticipate. We expect quarterly fluctuations to continue.
Available Information About Us
APEI was incorporated in Delaware in 2002 as the successor to a Virginia corporation incorporated in 1991. Our website is www.apei.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Information on or available through our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, and any reference to our website is intended to be an inactive textual reference only.
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
We and our institutions are regulated by (i) accrediting agencies, (ii) state regulatory bodies, and (iii) the federal government through ED. APUS, RU, and HCN are approved to participate in TA programs administered by DoD and veterans’ education benefits programs administered by the VA and are therefore also subject to oversight by those agencies. Regulations, standards, and policies of these agencies address the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, and financial operations and condition. We are also regulated in some cases other federal agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, and Federal Trade Commission, or FTC. 
The postsecondary education regulatory environment is complex and continues to evolve. Changes in or new interpretations of law, regulations, standards, and policies could have material consequences for our institutions’ accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under student financial assistance programs, and costs of doing business. The postsecondary education regulatory environment has also changed and may change in the future as a result of U.S. federal elections, changes in Presidential administrations and control of Congress, and legislative activity at the state level.
Additional information regarding the regulatory and legislative environment and potential risks associated with it is available below and in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
Accreditation
Institutional Accreditation
Accreditation is a voluntary, non-governmental process through which an institution submits to review its institution or programs based on the standards of the accrediting agency and the stated aims and purposes of the institution or program. Accrediting agencies establish criteria for accreditation, conduct peer-review evaluations, and publicly recognize those institutions or programs that meet the stated criteria and are considered accredited institutions or accredited programs. Accredited institutions and programs are subject to periodic review to assess institutional and program integrity, to encourage continued high performance and improvement, and to confirm that accreditation criteria continue to be satisfied. An institution or program that does not meet the criteria may have its accreditation limited, revoked, or not renewed.
Accreditation at the institutional level by an accrediting agency recognized by ED is necessary to participate in Title IV programs and TA. To be recognized by ED, accrediting agencies must adopt specific standards and procedures. If one of our institutions’ institutional accreditors was to lose its recognition as an accrediting agency and the institution was unable to obtain recognition from another recognized accrediting agency, the institution could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and TA. The loss of ability of one of our institutions to participate in either Title IV programs or TA could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Additional information about each of our institutions’ accreditation is provided above in “Our Institutions and Operations – Our Institutions – Academics – Accreditation” and as follows:
•APUS is institutionally accredited by HLC. APUS’s next reaffirmation of accreditation is scheduled for 2030-2031. APUS is accredited with the Open Pathway designation, which affords institutions greater opportunity to pursue institutional improvement projects than the alternative Standard Pathway designation.
•RU is institutionally accredited by HLC. RU’s next comprehensive evaluation for reaffirmation of accreditation is scheduled for 2025-2026. RU is accredited with the Open Pathway designation.
•HCN is institutionally accredited by ABHES. In February 2021, ABHES granted HCN continued accreditation through February 2027 for all programs at all campuses.
ABHES annually reviews student achievement indicators, including retention rate, placement rate, and licensing and credentialing examination pass rate. Under ABHES policy, ABHES may withdraw accreditation at any time if it determines that an institution fails to demonstrate at least a 70% retention rate for each program, a 70% placement rate for each program, and a 70% pass rate on mandatory licensing and credentialing examinations or fails to meet the state-mandated results for credentialing or licensure. Alternatively, ABHES may in its discretion provide an opportunity for a program that is not meeting ABHES’ outcomes thresholds to come into compliance within a period 
of time specified by ABHES, and ABHES may extend the period for achieving compliance if a program demonstrates improvement over time or other good cause. In prior years, several HCN programs at certain HCN campuses have failed to satisfy ABHES’s student achievement measures, and as a result ABHES has placed certain locations and programs on outcomes reporting status and required action plans. For the reporting year ended June 30, 2022, the PN program at the Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and Toledo campuses, and the ADN program at the Akron campus, were below the benchmark for retention. ABHES previously asked HCN to provide updated rates for the period July 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022 and an updated action plan to address any rate that remained below 70% in that period. HCN expects that ABHES will require programs below benchmark to provide similar reports based on the retention rate from the period between July 1, 2022 through March 31, 2023. The PN program at the Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton campuses were below benchmark in both 2020-2021 and 2021-2022, and in February 2023, ABHES placed the PN program at each of these campuses on program-specific warning status, which directs HCN to justify why approval of each program should not be withdrawn, which at a minimum will require HCN to demonstrate that it has developed and implemented a corrective action plan. For more information on the risks associated with these rates and program-specific warning status, refer to the risk factor in “Risk Factors” with the caption beginning “A failure of HCN to satisfy ABHES accreditation standards...”.
•GSUSA is institutionally accredited by ACCET. GSUSA does not participate in the Title IV, TA, or VA education benefits programs.
Institutional accreditation is an important attribute of our institutions. Colleges and universities depend, in part, on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Many institutions will only accept transfer credit from institutions with certain institutional accreditation. Students and sponsors of tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for quality assurance, and employers rely on institutions’ accredited status when evaluating a candidate’s credentials. Failure to maintain our institutional accreditations would result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and TA.
Programmatic Accreditation and Professional Recognition
In addition to institutional accreditation, our institutions have obtained programmatic accreditation or professional recognition for certain programs, as described more fully above in “Our Institutions and Operations – Our Institutions – Academics – Accreditation”. Among other standards and requirements, programmatic accreditors may utilize benchmarks for student outcomes in the programs they accredit and may require the institution to address outcomes that fail to satisfy those benchmarks or may take other action based on such matters. If one of our institutions fails to satisfy the standards of these programmatic accrediting agencies or professional organizations for the relevant programs, the institutions could be subject to restrictions or could lose the programmatic accreditation or professional recognition for those programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments, prevent the institution from offering the programs in certain states where programmatic accreditation is required, or prevent our students from seeking and obtaining licensure or employment.
The Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, or ACEN, accredits certain RU PN and ADN programs at certain RU locations. RU’s Illinois ADN program has been in candidacy status for initial accreditation with ACEN since July 2020. ACEN will not grant accreditation to a program on probationary status with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, or IDFPR, as RU’s Illinois ADN program is. The current candidacy is set to expire in July 2024. In September 2021, ACEN granted RU’s ADN program in Bloomington, Minnesota continued accreditation with conditions, and in September 2022, ACEN granted RU’s ADN and PN programs in Moorhead, Minnesota and RU’s ADN program in Overland Park, Kansas continued accreditation with conditions, in each case because the program experienced first-time NCLEX pass rates below ACEN’s required threshold. For the two Moorhead, Minnesota programs, ACEN also identified evidence of noncompliance with respect to analysis and use of assessment data in program decision-making. The ADN programs have two years, and the PN program has 18 months, from the date the conditions were imposed, to demonstrate compliance with all criteria related to the standard for which the programs were found to be in noncompliance. If compliance is not achieved by the end of the monitoring period, ACEN may determine to deny continuing accreditation absent good cause.
State Authorization/Licensure
Our institutions are subject to regulation by the states in which they operate. The level of oversight varies from state to state, and such regulations change frequently. State laws typically establish standards for instruction, faculty qualifications, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters. Some states prescribe regulations related to an institution’s financial condition, and some states require the posting of surety bonds. State laws and regulations may affect our institutions’ ability to offer educational programs, open locations, and award degrees. If one of our institutions fails to comply with a state’s requirements, it may lose its state licensure or authorization, which would result in the institution’s inability to enroll students in that state and could result in the institution’s inability to receive Title IV program funds and TA funds, at least for students in that state.
Some states assert authority to regulate an institution if its educational programs are offered to residents of those states, regardless of whether the institution maintains a physical presence in the state. The growth of online education has led and may further lead to new laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. New laws, regulations, or interpretations, including with respect to whether our institutions’ activities constitute a physical presence or otherwise may require authorization or licensure, could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could negatively affect enrollments and revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in our business activities could lead states that do not currently require our institutions to be authorized to require such authorization. The extent of this increase in regulatory obligations, and the associated costs and significance, are not known at this time. Furthermore, in some states it may take a significant amount of time to meet the applicable regulatory requirements with respect to a new program initiative, or we may not be able to do so at all.
The State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, or SARA, is a voluntary agreement among member states (all states except California), districts, and territories that establishes national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education and is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by institutions based in another jurisdiction. SARA requires member jurisdictions to approve institutions in their jurisdiction to participate in SARA, based upon institutional accreditation and financial stability, and to resolve student complaints. Applications must be renewed annually. SARA does not cover, or limits its coverage related to, certain activities. As a result, an institution may still be required to obtain state authorization from, for example, agencies, or boards responsible for professional licensure. For information on our institutions’ status under SARA, please refer to “State Authorization/Licensure of Our Institutions” in this Annual Report.
Many states also have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed as a professional in a specified field. Students’ success in obtaining licensure typically depends on numerous factors, including: individual merits of the graduate; whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure or by a professional association; whether the program meets all state requirements for professional licensure; and the accreditation of the institution and the specific program.
Federal Requirements for State Authorization/Licensure
“Home” State Authorization
ED regulations specify how an institution may demonstrate, as required by ED, that it is authorized to offer postsecondary education programs by the state(s) where it is located, including the state where its main campus is located, which we refer to as its “home” state, and that the home state otherwise satisfies ED requirements. If ED determines that an institution does not have the required state approval, the institution will be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs. If one of our institutions were to lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs in connection with “home” state authorization requirements, it would also lose its ability to participate in TA and VA, be unable to operate in the state and grant credentials, and lose institutional accreditation. 
State Authorization of Online Education
ED regulations require that an institution that offers postsecondary education through distance education to students located in a state in which the institution is not physically located or in which the institution is otherwise subject to the state’s jurisdiction must meet the state’s requirements to be legally offering postsecondary distance education in that state or must be covered by a state authorization reciprocity agreement, like SARA. ED regulations also now specify the required methodology for determining the state in which a student is located for purposes of satisfying state authorization requirements for distance education courses and require an institution to disclose certain information related to whether programs leading to professional licensure meet applicable state requirements, regardless of program modality. 
State Authorization/Licensure of Our Institutions
APUS is authorized to enroll students from each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. APUS is headquartered in Charles Town, West Virginia, and is authorized to offer its programs by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, or WVHEPC. Under current law, if APUS were to lose its accreditation by HLC, WVHEPC may suspend, withdraw, or revoke APUS’s authorization. Failure to comply with WVHEPC requirements could result in APUS losing its authorization from WVHEPC, its accreditation by HLC, its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and TA, or its ability to offer certain programs, any of which could force APUS to cease operations. APUS participates in SARA. APUS also has obtained authorization to operate in California, which is the only state that is a non-SARA jurisdiction. Until June 30, 2021, APUS was also required to be certified by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, or SCHEV, because it had administrative offices in Manassas, Virginia. However, effective May 31, 2021, APUS terminated its lease for administrative offices in Virginia, and APUS therefore did not renew its certification its SCHEV certification before it expired on June 30, 2021.
RU is headquartered in Bloomington, Minnesota, and has 22 campuses across Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin. HCN is headquartered in Westerville, Ohio, and has six campuses in Ohio, one in Indiana, and one in Michigan. RU and HCN have obtained from the relevant state postsecondary education agencies the requisite authorizations, approvals, or registrations for the states in which they have campuses. In addition, the nursing education programs offered by RU and HCN are approved by the relevant state boards of nursing. RU and HCN participate in SARA.
To maintain regulatory approval from the state board of nursing or equivalent body in the states that we operate, an educational program must maintain a certain pass rate, as defined by the state, of first-time test takers of the NCLEX. If a program does not attain this pass rate, the program may face various consequences, including development and implementation of a plan of corrective action, issuance of a corrective order, or revocation of approval pursuant to an adjudication proceeding. In Indiana, a program that is under initial accreditation may not be granted full accreditation if the program’s pass rate is lower than one standard deviation below the average national pass rate. In addition, if the program’s pass rate is lower than one standard deviation below the average national pass rate for three consecutive years, the program may be subject to additional oversight or a change in accreditation status. 
In recent years, a number of programs at certain RU campuses or in certain states, including its Bloomington, Minnesota, Illinois, Kansas, and Fort Myers, Florida ADN programs and its Moorhead, Minnesota PN program, as well as HCN’s Ohio ADN program, have not met state-established first-time NCLEX benchmarks for consecutive years. We believe that low pass rates may be the result of a number of factors, including without limitation the academic preparedness of our students, curriculum gaps, changes in the mode of course delivery including the use of virtual courses, testing failures and inconsistencies, imbalances in enrollment and resources, and changes in admission standards.
As a result of the Bloomington program’s pass rates, the Minnesota Board of Nursing, or MBN, conducted a survey of the program and found that RU had not complied with certain MBN rules. In August 2022, RU entered into a stipulation and consent stemming from the survey findings that requires the program to comply with the established first-time NCLEX pass rate by the end of 2023, maintain a specified student to faculty ratio in 2023, comply with MBN rules, and provide the MBN with quarterly status reports in 2023, with a potential penalty for non-compliance up to and including withdrawal of approval of the program. In addition, as a result of the order, the Minnesota Office of Higher Education, or MOHE, has informed RU of certain expectations it has with respect to the ADN program, including that RU must identify a clinical site for each student that is no more than 50 miles from the student’s home and must establish pathways for students to continue their education at a non-RU campus if the ADN program loses MBN approval. RU also fulfilled two information and documentation requests to MOHE in the Fall 2022 academic term and must continuously provide to MOHE NCLEX scores and copies of any reports submitted to MBN or ACEN as they become available.
In February 2022, RU’s Illinois ADN program was placed on probationary status by the IDFPR as a result of which RU is required to temporarily reduce admitted students in the program by 25% and has two years to demonstrate evidence of implementing strategies to correct deficiencies and satisfy the required NCLEX pass rate. If after two years the pass rate does not satisfy the required standard, the program will be reevaluated by the IDFPR for a determination as to whether the program will be allowed to continue on probation or whether it should be disapproved. An Illinois statute also requires nursing programs to have achieved accreditation by the end of 2022 in order to meet state approval requirements. Although the IDFPR has indicated that candidacy status satisfies this requirement, the IDFPR could change its position. See also “Accreditation – Programmatic Accreditation and Professional Recognition” above.
In April 2022, RU’s Kansas ADN program was issued a notice of concern by the Kansas Board of Nursing, or KBN, requiring RU to submit to the KBN a plan of action to improve its NCLEX pass rates. The Kansas ADN program has until April 2023 to increase its NCLEX pass rate to the regulatory standard. Kansas regulations were amended effective January 2022 to increase threshold pass rates and change corrective actions for noncompliance. The Kansas ADN program experienced pass rates below the amended threshold in 2022. It is unknown which corrective action standards the KBN may apply, but under the amended standards it could take action up to directing the program to cease admissions. 
In February 2023, the Florida Board of Nursing, or FBN, placed RU’s Fort Myers, Florida ADN program on probation until its pass rate reaches the applicable threshold for a calendar year. RU is required to disclose this status to active and prospective students. If the program fails to achieve the required NCLEX pass rate within two years following placement on probation, FBN may extend the program’s status for a year, provided demonstrated progress. However, absent further extension or achievement of the required rate by the end of the extension, Florida law provides that FBN shall terminate the program.
HCN’s ADN program has been on provisional approval status in Ohio since March 2017 due to not meeting the first-time pass rate standard for four consecutive years. The Ohio Board of Nursing, or OBN, will consider restoring a program to full approval status if the program meets the first-time pass rate standard for at least two consecutive years. In January 2023, OBN placed HCN’s PN program on provisional approval for a period of 18 months due to two self-reported instances of noncompliance with faculty credential and program records requirements. As a result, HCN must submit to OBN progress reports evidencing that it meets and maintains nursing program requirements. Additionally, HCN will host a site visit from OBN in 2024 after which OBN may reconsider the provisional approval status. If a program on provisional approval fails to meet OBN requirements at the end of the time period established for provisional approval, OBN may propose to continue provisional approval for a set time period or may propose to withdraw approval.
RU and HCN have been implementing changes to their instruction of the ADN program, including programmatic certification improvement plans at RU and curriculum, admissions, and academic achievement and course retake policy changes at HCN, in order to help prepare students and graduates for successful performance on the NCLEX. However, there is no assurance that these changes will be successful in the required time periods, or will not have negative effects on RU’s or HCN’s enrollment. If RU and HCN are unable to improve NCLEX scores over time, and in some cases by the deadlines imposed on their programs at certain campuses and in certain states as discussed above, this situation could have an adverse impact on their ability to enroll students and eventually our ability to continue offering the ADN programs associated with the applicable campuses.
Failure to comply with state authorization or licensure requirements has impacted and could in the future restrict our institutions’ ability to recruit or enroll students or result in other sanctions, including fines and penalties. New laws, regulations, interpretations, or changed circumstances related to our institutions’ educational programs could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students and offer programs in particular states, which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions’ enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business. Additional information regarding the current impacts and potential risks associated with our NCLEX pass rates is provided in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements
Our students finance their education through a combination of Title IV programs, TA, education benefits administered by the VA, private loans, corporate reimbursement programs, individual resources, and institutional grants, and in the case of RU and HCN, an extended payment plan option. Participation in federal student aid programs, including those administered by the DoD and VA, and the extended payment plan option at RU and HCN, adds to the regulation of our operations. In particular, the Higher Education Act of 1964, as amended, or the HEA, and related ED regulations subject us to significant scrutiny in the form of numerous standards we must satisfy in order to participate in and administer Title IV programs.
Department of Education
The federal government provides support for postsecondary education through the Title IV programs in the form of grants and loans to eligible students who can use those funds to enroll in an eligible educational program at any institution that has been certified by ED. An institution will be certified to participate in the Title IV programs only if, among other things, it enters into a written program participation agreement, or PPA, with ED, which conditions participation in Title IV programs upon compliance with ED regulations and any additional conditions specified in the PPA.
Higher Education Act
The HEA must be periodically reauthorized by Congress and each Title IV program must be funded through appropriations acts on an annual basis. The most recent comprehensive reauthorization occurred in 2008 when Congress reauthorized most HEA programs through the 2014 federal fiscal year. The reauthorization has been temporarily extended in the years that have followed. Congress previously considered comprehensive legislation to reauthorize the HEA, including proposals from Republicans and Democrats, referred to as the Student Aid Improvement Act and the College Affordability Act, respectively, and Congress could consider such legislation again in the future.
We cannot predict whether, in what form, or when, the two houses of Congress will reauthorize the HEA or whether, or when, the President will sign reauthorization legislation. Amendments to the HEA could occur as part of reauthorization, which could require us to modify our business practices and increase administrative costs, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations.
Types of Title IV Financial Aid Programs.
Title IV program aid is primarily awarded to students on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending an institution and the amount a student can reasonably contribute. Our students receive grants and loans to fund their education under several Title IV programs, of which the two largest are Direct Loans and Pell Grants. Some of our students may also be eligible for other Title IV grant programs, such as the Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant. The Title IV programs are subject to Congressional action in terms of appropriations and other legislation that may affect funding levels, student eligibility, and other requirements. For example, the Pell Grant program could be subject to cuts or changes in the future, and cuts in ED’s administrative budget could lead to delays in student eligibility determinations and delays in origination and processing of federal student loans.
Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs
To be eligible and certified to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by ED, must be authorized to operate by the appropriate regulatory authority in each state where the institution maintains a physical presence, and must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the HEA and the regulations issued thereunder by ED.
ED periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations. Accrediting agencies and state education agencies also have responsibilities for overseeing institutional compliance with certain Title IV program requirements. For these reasons, we cannot predict with certainty how Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. Key provisions relating to institutional participation in Title IV and the processing of Title IV aid that could adversely affect us include the following:
Eligibility and Certification Procedures. An institution must apply periodically to ED for continued certification to participate in Title IV programs. Recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control. An institution may come under review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding a new program, or, in certain cases, when it modifies academic credentials that it offers.
ED may place an institution on provisional certification status if ED finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all Title IV requirements and in certain other circumstances, such as when an institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control. During a period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions imposed by ED. In addition, ED may more closely review a provisionally certified institution if it applies for approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school, or make any other significant change. If ED determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities, it may seek to revoke the institution’s certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections than if it were fully certified.
In June 2020, APUS timely applied for recertification to participate in Title IV programs. ED subsequently notified APUS that it had completed its review of APUS’s application and had granted APUS provisional certification until June 30, 2023. APUS must apply for recertification by March 31, 2023. ED issued APUS a provisional program participation agreement, or PPPA, outlining the terms of provisional certification. As described in the PPPA, ED granted approval on a provisional basis because APUS was subject to an open program review at the time of renewal. That program review was closed in January 2021 with no findings, penalties, or further action required. 
In July 2021, ED notified RU that in connection with RU’s March 2019 change in ownership that preceded our acquisition of RU, ED was imposing certain temporary growth restrictions on the institution, including imposing limitations on new programs and locations and imposing a cap on the number of students that participate in Title IV programs that can be enrolled. ED also continued to require RU to submit periodic financial and Title IV enrollment reports, a requirement first imposed in connection with the financial responsibility letter of credit described below. In September 2021, RU submitted a change in ownership and control application to ED seeking approval to participate in the Title IV programs under our ownership. ED and RU entered into a Temporary Provisional Program Participation Agreement, or TPPPA, effective as of October 14, 2021, that allows RU to continue disbursing Title IV funds while ED reviews the change in ownership application. The TPPPA continues the growth restrictions that ED imposed as a result of the March 2019 change in ownership, including the enrollment cap. The TPPPA specifies that after ED reviews and accepts financial statements and compliance audits for one complete fiscal year of RU’s Title IV participation under APEI’s ownership, RU may seek removal of the enrollment cap and approval for new programs that replace current programs. The TPPPA also specifies that at least until after ED reviews and accepts financial statements and compliance audits that cover the second complete fiscal year of RU’s Title IV participation under our ownership, RU must seek pre-approval for new locations, new programs that are not replacing current programs, and other changes. The growth restrictions under the TPPPA could limit or adversely affect RU’s growth opportunities, including restricting its ability to serve additional students, particularly additional nursing students, and limiting its ability to continue to evolve to address current needs by providing new or changed programs.
In June 2021, HCN timely applied for recertification to participate in Title IV programs. ED subsequently notified HCN that it had been granted provisional certification until September 30, 2023. HCN must apply for recertification by June 30, 2023. As described in the PPPA, ED granted approval on a provisional basis because HCN was subject to an open program review at the time of recertification. As described in “Compliance with Regulatory Standards and Effect of Regulatory Violations – Compliance Reviews”, in July 2022, HCN received a final program review determination from ED, and in September 2022, ED notified HCN that it had closed the program review and no further action was required.
Administrative Capability. ED regulations specify extensive criteria that an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV programs. These criteria relate to, among other things, institutional staffing, operational standards such as procedures for disbursing and safeguarding Title IV program funds, timely submission of accurate reports to ED, referring to ED’s Office of Inspector General, or ED OIG, credible information that a student or employees with Title IV responsibilities may have engaged in fraud or illegal conduct in connection with Title IV program administration, and various other procedural matters.
Financial Responsibility. The HEA and ED regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. These standards generally require that an institution provide the services described in its official publications and statements, properly administer Title IV programs in which it participates, and meet all of its financial obligations, including making required refunds and any repayments to ED.
ED evaluates institutions on an annual basis for compliance with specified financial responsibility standards, including a complex formula based on line items from the institution’s audited financial statements. The formula focuses on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio (which measures the institution’s capital resources, financial viability, and ability to borrow); (2) primary reserve ratio (which measures the institution’s viability and liquidity); and (3) net income ratio (which measures the institution’s profitability or ability to operate within its means). Generally, an institution’s financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible. A composite score between 1.0 and 1.4 is considered by ED to be in the “zone”, and the “zone alternative” permits institutions to demonstrate financial responsibility by meeting specific monitoring requirements. Under the zone alternative, an institution: must request and receive funds under the heightened cash monitoring or reimbursement payment methods (resulting in a delayed method of cash funding for Title IV aid); may be required to provide additional information to ED upon request (e.g., early submission of financial statement and compliance audit, information about current operations and future plans); must require its auditor to express an opinion regarding compliance with zone alternative requirements; and must provide timely information to ED regarding certain oversight and financial events. 
As of September 30, 2020, prior to the Rasmussen Acquisition, RU had a composite score equal to 1.4. RU elected to post a letter of credit with ED totaling $23.1 million, which represents 10% of the Title IV program funds received by RU during its most recently completed fiscal year. Upon the closing of the Rasmussen Acquisition, APEI was required to fund this letter of credit using a restricted deposit account that required a deposit of 105%, or $24.2 million, to secure the RU letter of credit. Under the TPPPA for RU described above, a letter of credit will continue to be required at least until ED reviews and accepts financial statements and compliance audits that cover one complete fiscal year of RU’s Title IV participation under APEI’s ownership. Additionally, RU is required to make Title IV disbursements to eligible students and parents under the 
heightened cash monitoring payment method, or HCM1. Under HCM1, RU must first make Title IV disbursements to eligible students and parents and pay any credit balances before the institution requests or receives funds for the amount of those disbursements from ED. 
ED may also apply the financial responsibility standards to other entities under common ownership with an eligible institution. At the request of ED, for purposes of evaluating the financial responsibility of our institutions, including the composite score calculation, we supply consolidated financial statements to ED. Because ED does not review each of our institution’s financial statements separately, a determination by ED that our consolidated financial statements do not satisfy the “financial responsibility” requirements could cause all of our institutions to lose access to Title IV program funding or result in other penalties or conditions on continued participation.
In September 2019, ED published amendments to its financial responsibility standards that took effect July 1, 2020. We refer to these regulations as the 2019 Borrower Defense Regulations. The 2019 Borrower Defense Regulations identify certain conditions or other triggering events that have or may have an adverse material effect on the institution’s financial condition, in response to which ED would or could require that the institution submit some form of financial protection, such as a letter of credit, to ED. Triggering events are characterized as either mandatory or discretionary. ED will consider an institution unable to meet its financial or administrative obligations if an institution experiences a mandatory triggering event. ED may consider an institution not to be financially responsible if an institution experiences a discretionary triggering event. If the institution is subject to two or more of these discretionary triggering events, ED will consider the institution to be subject to a mandatory triggering event and therefore unable to meet its financial or administrative obligations. For each triggering event, to demonstrate that the institution remains financially responsible, the institution may submit evidence that the triggering event has been resolved, that the institution has insurance that will cover part or all of the debt or liabilities, or that the triggering event has not or will not have a material adverse effect on the institution. If ED determines that one of our institutions is not financially responsible because of one or more triggering events, the institution would be required to provide an irrevocable letter of credit equal to at least 10% of the amount of federal student financial aid funds received by the institution for the past year. ED has indicated a target date of April 2023 for publication of proposed regulations to amend the current financial responsibility standards.
The “90/10 Rule.” Under the so-called “90/10 Rule”, a for-profit institution is prohibited from deriving more than 90% of its revenue (as computed by ED) on a cash accounting basis (except for certain institutional loans) from Title IV programs for any fiscal year. If an institution fails to satisfy the 90/10 Rule for any fiscal year, the institution is placed on provisional status for two fiscal years. An institution that fails to satisfy the rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years and is required to demonstrate compliance with Title IV eligibility and certification requirements for at least two additional fiscal years prior to resuming Title IV program participation.
Using the applicable 90/10 formula, the following table contains the percentage of cash-basis revenue earned from Title IV program funds: 

 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022
APUS | 35% | 34% | 31% 
RU | 76% | 75% | 74% 
HCN | 82% | 81% | 80% 

The American Rescue Plan Act or ARPA, which was enacted in March 2021, modifies the HEA’s 90/10 Rule to require that a for-profit institution derive not less than 10 percent of its revenue from sources other than “federal education assistance funds”. ARPA provides that the amendment applies to institutional fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. ED published final regulations in October 2022 that address ARPA’s amendments to the 90/10 Rule. The regulations provide that for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, federal funds used to calculate the “90” side of the ratio include Title IV funds and any other educational assistance funds provided by a federal agency directly to an institution or a student, including the federal portion of any grant funds provided by or administered by a non-federal agency, except for non-Title IV federal funds provided directly to a student to cover expenses other than tuition, fees, and other institutional charges. ED confirmed that the 90/10 Rule would no longer permit institutions to count federal aid for veterans and service members as part of the “10%” side of the ratio. As a result, effective January 1, 2023, TA and VA benefits are included in the “90%” side of the ratio, and our institutions’ 90/10 Rule percentages will increase, particularly at APUS. See the Risk Factor captioned “If one or more of our institutions does not comply with the 90/10 Rule, it or they will lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs.” The final regulations also include other requirements, including: institutions must request and disburse Title IV funds before the end of the fiscal year (or, for institutions operating under the reimbursement method or the heightened cash monitoring method, make disbursements by the end of the fiscal year and report the funds in the “90%” side of the ratio 
for that fiscal year); institutions are restricted in when and how they can count institutional loans and alternative financing arrangements as non-federal revenue; institutions may, under certain circumstances, include non-federal revenue from non-Title IV programs in their 90/10 calculation; and institutions must notify ED and students in a timely manner if they fail the 90/10 Rule. 
Incentive Payment Rule. An institution participating in Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions, or financial aid awarding activity based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or federal student financial aid. ED has previously announced that it will calculate institutional liability for noncompliance with the incentive payment rule by calculating the cost to ED of the Title IV funds improperly received by the institution, including the cost to ED of all of the Title IV funds received by the institution over a particular period of time if those funds were obtained through implementation of a policy or practice in which students were recruited in violation of the incentive payment rule. ED may also fine an institution, or take administrative action to limit, suspend, revoke, deny, or terminate an institution’s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, if the institution violates the prohibition.
We have designed our employee compensation and third-party contractual arrangements to comply with the incentive payment rule currently in effect. However, because there are ambiguities as to how the rule is interpreted and enforced by ED and because we could make errors in implementation, we can make no assurances that ED would not find deficiencies in our past, current, or future employee compensation plans and relevant third-party contractual arrangements. In addition, in recent years, other postsecondary education institutions have been named as defendants in whistleblower lawsuits, known as “qui tam” cases, brought pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, alleging that an institution’s compensation practices did not comply with the incentive payment rule. Any such litigation could be costly and could divert management’s time and attention away from the business, regardless of whether a claim has merit. The incentive payment rule also influences how our institutions are able to compensate and motivate their employees.
Student Loan Defaults. Under the HEA, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if defaults on the repayment of federal loans by its students exceed 30% for each of three consecutive years, or 40% in any one year. An institution’s cohort default rate is calculated as the percentage of borrowers who entered repayment in the relevant fiscal year who default before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the borrowers entered repayment. If an institution’s cohort default rate is equal to or greater than 30%, it must establish a default prevention task force.
In October 2022, ED released official three-year cohort default rates for federal fiscal year 2019. The final official ED cohort default rates for APUS, RU, and HCN for the federal fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019 are as follows:

 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019
APUS | 15.2% | 9.4% | 2.4%
RU | 9.4% | 7.8% | 1.6%
HCN | 12.1% | 8.1% | 1.1%

If one or more of our institutions has a default rate in excess of allowable levels, it could result in that institution’s or those institutions’ loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or incurring additional costs related to default prevention. In March 2020, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, ED implemented a temporary freeze on payments and interest accruals for federal student loans that is expected to continue pending implementation of ED’s broader debt relief program or resolution of associated litigation. During this period of temporary relief, we would expect borrowers to be substantially less likely to default on federal student loans, which may have artificially lowered our institutions’ cohort default rates for federal fiscal year 2019 and may similarly artificially lower our institutions’ cohort default rates for federal fiscal years occurring during the forbearance period. Upon expiration of the temporary freeze, borrowers will again need to make repayments on loans and loans will again accrue interest, which may lead to higher cohort default rates. 
Third-Party Servicers. ED regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institution’s participation in Title IV programs. Our institutions utilize third-party servicers for some services and in the future may consider using third-party servicers for other functions that are currently managed directly by our institutions. Third-party servicers must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to ED for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV provision. An institution must report to ED new contracts with or any significant modifications to contracts with third-party servicers and other matters related to third-party servicers. If any third-party servicer engaged by one of our institutions does not comply with 
applicable statutes and regulations, our institution may be liable for its actions, and our institution could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.
ED recently issued new guidance that significantly expands the types of activities and functions that constitute third-party servicer activities for Title IV purposes, including, for example, recruitment and retention services, provision of software products and services that involve Title IV administration activities, and provision of educational content and instruction. The guidance, with respect to which ED has invited comments, also states ED’s position that an institution may not contract with a vendor that is a third-party servicer for Title IV purposes if the vendor (or its subcontractors) is located outside the U.S. or is owned or operated by an individual who is not a U.S. citizen or national or a lawful U.S. permanent resident. Our institutions must assess their arrangements with third parties to determine whether a vendor must now be treated as a third-party servicer based on the guidance, and such assessment may lead to a need to modify or end existing contracts and establish new contracts.
Title IV Return of Funds. When a student withdraws, an institution must return unearned Title IV program funds to ED in a timely manner. An institution must first determine the amount of funds that a student “earned” before withdrawal. If the student withdraws during the first 60% of any period of enrollment or payment period, the amount of Title IV program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible. If the student withdraws after the 60% threshold, then the student has earned 100% of the Title IV program funds. The institution must return to the appropriate Title IV programs, in a specified order, the lesser of (i) the unearned Title IV program funds or (ii) the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned Title IV program funds. An institution must return the funds no later than 45 days after the date of the institution’s determination that a student withdrew.
If 5% or more of such returns were not timely made, the institution may be required to submit a letter of credit in favor of ED equal to 25% of the amount of unearned Title IV funds the institution was required to return for its most recently completed fiscal year. If ED determines that one of our institutions has repeatedly failed to comply with ED regulations, it may take adverse action against the institution on the basis of the repeated finding or may find that the institution has failed to demonstrate administrative capability, as described above. As described in Compliance with Regulatory Standards and Effect of Regulatory Violations – Compliance Reviews, in January 2022, HCN received a program review report from ED that included a finding related to return of Title IV funds calculations that were not properly calculated. In connection with that finding, HCN was required to conduct a full file review and have the review tested by an independent auditor. In July 2022, HCN issued a final program review determination with respect to all findings, resulting in total liabilities of approximately $12,000.
Misrepresentation. Under the HEA and its implementing regulations, ED may fine, suspend or terminate the participation in Title IV programs by an institution that engages in substantial misrepresentation regarding the nature of its education program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. The rule covers both acts and omissions of fact.
The Clery Act. Our institutions must comply with certain campus safety and security reporting requirements as well as other requirements in the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, or the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires an institution, among other things, to report to ED and disclose in an annual security report, for the three most recent calendar years, statistics concerning the number of certain crimes that occurred on or within the institution’s “Clery geography,” which comprises an institution’s campus and non-campus buildings and property, public property on or adjacent to and accessible from the campus, and in some cases areas within the patrol jurisdiction of the campus police or security department, and to publish certain policies and procedures related to campus safety. A failure to comply with the Clery Act could result in our institutions being fined or having their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs limited, suspended, or terminated, could lead to litigation, or could harm our institutions’ reputation, each of which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions’ enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business.
Borrower Defenses. Under the HEA, ED regulations may specify which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment, or BDTR, of a Direct Loan. ED’s previous regulations permitted a borrower to assert a BDTR of a Direct Loan if the institution’s acts or omissions give rise to a cause of action against the institution under state law. In November 2016, ED published the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations, which address, among other matters, which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a student borrower or group of borrowers may assert as a defense to repayment of a Direct Loan. For Direct Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2017, the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations created a new federal standard for BDTR of Direct Loans, new limitation periods for such claims, and new processes for resolution of such claims. The 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations were in effect until the 2019 Borrower Defense Regulations went into effect July 1, 2020. In September 2019, ED published the 2019 Borrower Defense Regulations, which, among other things, modify the BDTR for Direct Loans made on or after July 1, 2020, the limitation periods for such claims, and the processes for resolution of such claims. The 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations continue to apply to all Direct Loans made on or after July 1, 2017 and before July 1, 2020, with certain exceptions pursuant to the 2019 Borrower Defense 
Regulations. The 2019 Borrower Defense Regulations apply to all Direct Loans made on or after July 1, 2020 and before July 1, 2023 due to the 2022 Borrower Defense Regulations explained below.
In March 2021, ED announced a revised approach for determining relief for borrowers who successfully assert borrower relief claims. Under this new approach, a borrower will receive full loan relief when evidence shows that the institution engaged in certain misconduct. This policy rescinded the prior administration’s formula that generally granted only partial loan relief for borrower defense claims. Under the 2016 and the 2019 Borrower Defense Regulations, ED may initiate a separate proceeding to collect from an institution the amount of relief granted based on a BDTR claim. If ED determines that borrowers of Direct Loans who attended our institutions have a defense to repayment of their Direct Loans, our repayment liability to ED could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
On November 1, 2022, ED published final regulations with an effective date of July 1, 2023 to address BDTR, loan discharge, pre-dispute arbitration and class-action waivers, among other issues, or the 2022 Borrower Defense Regulations. The 2022 Borrower Defense Regulations will create a single standard and streamlined process for relief that will: apply to all future and pending BDTR claims as of July 1, 2023 instead of standards varying based on the date of the borrower’s first loan disbursement; define what kinds of misconduct could lead to borrower defense discharges (substantial misrepresentation, substantial omission of fact, breach of contract, aggressive and deceptive recruitment, and certain judgments or final ED actions); establish a reconsideration process for borrowers whose claims are not approved for a full discharge; create a process for forming groups of borrowers and adjudicating claims based on the common facts of those group claims; and provide a clear timeline for adjudication of group and individual claims. The 2022 Borrower Defense Regulations indicate that ED will hold colleges accountable for the cost of discharges, including by establishing a recoupment process separate from the approval of BDTR claims and making a recoupment determination based on the standards in place at the time the loan was first disbursed. 
Closed School Loan Discharge. The 2019 Borrower Defense Regulations modified ED’s requirements with respect to the circumstances under which a borrower is eligible for a loan discharge if an institution or location closes. For example, the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations previously provided for an automatic loan discharge under certain circumstances, but the 2019 Borrower Defense Regulations eliminated the automatic loan discharge for schools closing on or after July 1, 2020. Based on the automatic loan discharge rules, ED found RU responsible for $168,630 in closed school loan discharges as a result of campus consolidations in North Dakota in 2015 and in Wisconsin in 2016; the liability was reduced on appeal to $77,569. RU may also face closed school discharge liabilities as a result of the 2021 consolidation of two Florida campuses. The 2022 Borrower Defense Regulations will provide for automatic discharges to any borrower who was enrolled within 180 days prior to a school’s closure and who did not complete their education at the school or through an approved teach-out agreement at another school within one year after the closure of their original school. The final regulations shorten the previous period for automatic discharge so borrowers do not default on their loans after a closure of their school.
Dispute Resolution. The 2019 Borrower Defense Regulations also generally removed prohibitions on pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class action waivers contained in the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations and required institutions whose students must enter into pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class action waivers as a condition of enrollment to disclose publicly those requirements in an easily accessible format and prohibited such institutions from requiring a student to participate in arbitration or any internal dispute resolution process prior to filing a BDTR application with ED. The 2022 Borrower Defense Regulations prohibit institutions from requiring borrowers to sign mandatory pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class action waivers for claims related to the making of a Federal Direct Loan or the provision of educational services for which the loan was obtained. 
COVID-19 Financial Aid Matters. ED has issued several guidance documents regarding the appropriate use of monetary relief provided to higher education institutions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and related reporting requirements regarding regulatory flexibility in the administration of federal student aid as a result of challenges related to COVID-19. These guidance documents provide institutions further information on allowable practices for the administration of federal work study, measurement of satisfactory academic progress, and proper return of unearned federal student aid to ED. In addition, ED implemented a temporary freeze on payments and interest accruals for federal student loans. This administrative forbearance period began on March 20, 2020 and was extended several times. On November 22, 2022, ED announced that the administrative forbearance would continue pending implementation of ED’s broader debt relief program or resolution of associated litigation. Specifically, payments will resume 60 days after ED is permitted to implement the program or the litigation is resolved. If the program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, 2023, payments will resume 60 days after that date. We cannot predict the extent to which the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or related regulatory or legislative activity may impact us or our institutions in the future.
Other Department of Education Regulation
Privacy of Student Personal Information and Records. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, and ED’s regulations implementing FERPA require education institutions to protect the privacy of students’ education records by, among other things, limiting disclosure of a student’s personally identifiable information without prior written consent. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, ED may require corrective actions or terminate eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. In addition, education institutions engaged in financial activities such as the granting of student loans are obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and implementing regulations, which among other things, requires reasonable security practices to protect personally identifiable financial information of students, parents, or other individuals in a customer relationship with the institution. Failure to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements may result in FTC enforcement, which could include the imposition of conditions, penalties, monitoring, and oversight. Institutions are also subject to the FTC’s general deceptive and unfair practices jurisdiction of Section 5 of the FTC Act for processing student information. FTC enforcement focuses primarily on: (1) collecting, using, sharing, or retaining personal information inconsistent with representations, commitments, and promises in privacy policies and other public statements; (2) privacy policies that do not adequately inform consumers about actual practices; and (3) failing to reasonably protect the security, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information. Institutions must also comply with the FTC Red Flags Rule, a requirement designed to identify and mitigate identity theft for certain student accounts. States can also bring similar enforcement actions under so called “mini-FTC Acts” as well as other applicable privacy and security laws. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, and implementing regulations impose disclosure and notice obligations on institutions and provides a broad array of consumer rights relating to California residents and their personal information, including among others, the right to access personal information, the right to opt out of sales of personal information, and the right to delete personal information. The CCPA has the potential for significant civil penalties for failing to comply as well as a private right of action and statutory damages for data breaches that are the result of unreasonable security. The California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, will expand the CCPA’s requirements when it becomes effective in 2023 and other comprehensive state privacy laws with varying requirements also come into effect in 2023. Our collection of personal information relating to individuals in the European Union, or EU, may implicate the EU’s comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Non-compliance with the GDPR could result in a fine for certain activities of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of an organization’s global annual revenue, whichever is higher, per violation.
Accessibility for Students with Disabilities. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or Section 504, prohibits discrimination against a person with a disability by any organization that receives federal financial assistance, which includes us. ED’s Office for Civil Rights, which enforces Section 504, together with the Department of Justice, has asserted that requiring the use of technology in a classroom environment when such technology is inaccessible to individuals with disabilities violates Section 504, unless those individuals are provided accommodations or modifications that permit them to receive all the educational benefits provided by the technology in an equally effective and integrated manner. In recent years, ED’s Office for Civil Rights has taken enforcement action against several institutions of higher education, including primarily online institutions, after determining that their websites and online learning management platforms were not accessible to persons with a disability. If one of our institutions is found to have violated Section 504, it may be required to modify existing content and functionality of its online classroom or other uses of technology, including through adoption of specific technical standards. An institution that does not come into compliance with Section 504 could lose access to federal funding, including the ability to participate in the Title IV programs and TA.
Title IX. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, or Title IX, prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs that receive funding from the federal government. ED regulations effective as of August 2020 define what constitutes sexual harassment for purposes of Title IX in the administrative enforcement context, describe what actions trigger an institution’s obligation to respond to incidents of alleged sexual harassment, and specify how an institution must respond to allegations of sexual harassment. In June 2022, ED released proposed regulations that would significantly revise how schools, including higher education institutions, must address cases involving sex-based discrimination, including cases of sexual harassment, sex-based harassment, and assault. The proposed regulations also would explicitly include protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics. In addition, the proposed regulations would update protections against discrimination because of pregnancy, related conditions, or terminations of pregnancy.
Distance Education. Regulations that were effective July 2021 provide institutions additional flexibility in offering distance education and competency-based education programs. Definitions in the rule clarify the instructional requirements that distance education programs must abide in order to remain eligible for Title IV disbursements. Failure to comply with these standards could lead to adverse actions by ED.
Department of Defense
Regulation of Tuition and Credentialing Assistance
Service members of the U.S. Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the DoD’s TA program. Service members may use TA to pursue postsecondary degrees at institutions that are accredited by accrediting agencies recognized by ED. APUS participates in TA, and for students in APUS undergraduate, and beginning January 2020, for students in APUS master’s programs, APUS provided grants so that APUS tuition rates per credit hour can be 100% covered by TA provided that the student does not exceed the annual limits per student. RU and HCN also participate in TA. RU’s active-duty military students in most undergraduate programs and master’s level graduate programs receive per credit tuition pricing at a tuition rate that is commensurate with available TA funding to allow tuition charges to be 100% covered by TA. HCN offers an alumni achievement grant of up to $1,200 to assist qualifying PN program alumni as they progress into the ADN program, as well as an institutional affordability grant to students demonstrating financial need to cover the difference between the total cost of tuition and fees less the amount of all eligible financial aid resources.
In March 2013, DoD restricted the ability of service members who have not previously taken a postsecondary education course and who are in certain duty locations outside the continental United States, or overseas locations, to receive TA for courses offered by institutions of higher education that are not parties to contracts with the DoD to provide DoD voluntary education programs at those locations. Because we do not have contracts with the DoD to provide instruction at overseas locations, service members who begin their first postsecondary education program after arrival at an applicable overseas location may not use TA to pay for their education in our programs until after they have already successfully completed a course with an institution that has entered into a contract to provide voluntary education programs at that overseas location. Service members who were already enrolled in one of our programs before arriving at an overseas location may continue to receive TA for the in-progress program, but they will be encouraged to enroll in courses provided by institutions that provide programs at the applicable overseas duty location.
DoD requires educational institutions to meet certain criteria, including generally having at least 20 students on base, and to request access in writing that outlines among other things the specific purpose of the visit, in order to access installations solely to provide counseling, and the Air Force expressly prohibits education institutions from holding regular or recurring office hours on installations solely to provide counseling. This limits APUS’s ability to support existing students and serve new students. If APUS is not able to improve its access to military installations and its existing students on those installations, or find alternative methods to serve those students, its military enrollments may decline.
Each institution participating in TA is required to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, outlining certain commitments and agreements between the institution and DoD prior to being permitted to participate in TA. Pursuant to the DoD MOUs, among other requirements, institutions must: explain certain tools to service members, such as ED’s “College Navigator” website and the “Paying for College” website of the CFPB; comply with requirements related to readmission policies for service members; abide by limitations on the use of funds derived from TA; provide certain academic and student support services; disclose information about transfer of credit; in certain circumstances, return TA funds to DoD (such as when a student ceases to attend or an institution cancels a course); offer to service members loan counseling before private student loans are offered or recommended; and comply with ED’s Title IV “program integrity” rules, including rules related to incentive payments and misrepresentation. The DoD MOUs also provide that an institution may only participate in TA if it is accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED, approved for VA funding, and a participant in Title IV programs. Additional information regarding the potential risks associated with the DoD MOUs is provided in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
Several federal government agencies have established an online student complaint system for service members, veterans, and their families to report negative experiences at education institutions and training programs administering the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, or Post-9/11 GI Bill, TA, and other military-related education benefit programs. An institution having recurring substantive complaints, or demonstrating an unwillingness to resolve complaints, may face a range of penalties, including revocation of its MOU and removal from participation in TA.
In addition to TA, branches of the U.S. military offer CA, which links soldiers to and in many cases provides funds for approved training courses or exams related to occupational licenses or certifications, and associated books, supplies and materials. Students in the military may use both TA and CA, subject to a combined cap on benefits. COOL is a program for each of the military branches and DoD civilians that links military occupations and experiences to civilian credentials (e.g., occupational certifications, licenses, and apprenticeships). While benefits vary by service, service members may be eligible for assistance in paying for certifications, including by prior payment (e.g., vouchers) or service member reimbursement. Students must meet certain eligibility requirements in order to receive CA, including in some cases service time, experience, and TA 
eligibility requirements. The Army additionally offers an expanded credentialing program designed to support soldiers who wish to pursue civilian credentials, licenses, and certifications that lead directly to a specific job, including in areas outside of a soldier’s Military Occupational Specialty. Through Army CA, soldiers can request funding for fees associated with qualifying programs listed on Army COOL. APUS is an approved training provider for Army CA programs. Students in the Army utilizing both Army CA and TA are subject to an annual combined cap on benefits of $4,000. We believe other service branches may follow the Army’s example or pursue other approaches to enhancing support for credentialing, including, for example, the Coast Guard’s CA Program, which has an annual combined cap on benefits of $9,000. 
Department of Defense Funding
A series of automatic federal budget cuts, known as sequestration, have impacted certain federal student aid programs since fiscal year 2013 and have been extended through fiscal year 2030. As a result of uncertainty about the availability of funding, several military branches initially suspended and later announced changes to their TA programs. For example, the Army now requires service members to complete one year of service after graduation from Advanced Individual Training in order to be eligible for TA, and the Army and the Coast Guard have both reduced the total per service member annual benefits.
Congressional inaction on budgetary matters has led to lapses in funding, resulting in government shutdowns, and subsequent policy changes that have affected federal student aid programs at DoD. A future government shutdown, particularly one that includes DoD or suspension or resulting modification of TA programs, including in connection with the failure to increase or a delay in increasing the federal debt ceiling, could have a material adverse effect on APUS’s enrollments and on our cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition.
Funding shortfalls have also affected DoD federal student aid programs. For example, as a result of the expected exhaustion of annual TA benefits available to sailors, in May 2019, the Navy ceased approving TA funds for eligible sailors until the start of the government’s fiscal year 2020. Currently, Navy service members must have a minimum of three years of service before becoming eligible to use TA and cannot be in their last year of service, and for TA and the Navy College Program for Afloat College Education, funding is capped at 18 semester hours per fiscal year combined, and career funding is capped at 120 semester hours combined. In addition, eligible sailors can only use TA to fund two courses each quarter of the fiscal year, and reservists on one-year orders are ineligible for TA. 
We expect each military branch and the DoD to continually evaluate their approach to education funding, and the resulting changes could have an impact on the funds available to service members to pursue their education at our institutions.
Department of Veterans Affairs
The VA administers education benefits provided by federal law, including the Montgomery GI Bill, or GI Bill, and the Post-9/11 GI Bill. APUS, RU and HCN are approved to provide education to veterans and members of the selective reserve and their dependents by the state approving agencies where the campus is located. In order for an institution to participate in VA education benefits, it must be a participant in the Title IV programs.
For the 2022-2023 academic year, an eligible veteran who attends a non-public U.S. institution may receive veterans’ education benefits to pay for tuition and fees based on the net cost to the veteran up to $26,381.37. Veterans pursuing a program of education on a more than half-time basis at an on-campus location are eligible for a monthly housing allowance equal to the basic allowance for housing available to service members in that location who are at a military pay grade E-5 and have dependents. Veterans pursuing a program of education solely through distance education on a more than half-time basis are eligible to receive a monthly housing allowance equal to 50% of the national average, or $916.50 per month.
To the extent that TA does not cover the full cost of tuition for service members, eligible service members may also use their benefits under the GI Bill or the Post-9/11 GI Bill through the “Top-Up” program. The “Top-Up” program allows U.S. Military active-duty service members to use their GI Bill or Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to pay the difference between the total cost of a college course and the amount of TA that is paid by the military for the course but is limited to 36 months of payments.
The Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020, or the Isakson Roe Act, enacted in January 2021, modified policies related to GI Bill and other VA-administered education funds, in part to align VA requirements with DoD and ED requirements related to student financial aid. Section 1018 of the Isakson Roe Act mandates that schools that receive veterans education benefits: (i) provide VA students with information on total cost of an education program, an estimate of debt the student will have upon graduation, graduation rates, requirements to obtain any 
license, certification, or approval for which the course of education is designed to provide preparation, and certain other information; (ii) inform VA students of the availability and potential eligibility of federal financial aid before packaging or arranging private student loans or alternative financing programs; (iii) avoid fraudulent and unduly aggressive recruiting or automatic renewal techniques; (iv) avoid misrepresentations or payment of incentive compensation on the basis of securing enrollments; (v) provide VA students with information regarding graduation requirements; (vii) obtain required approvals from the institutions’ accrediting agency for new courses or programs; (viii) maintain a policy to accommodate service members and reservists to be readmitted if they are temporarily unable to attend due to service requirements; and (ix) appoint a point of contact to provide academic and financial aid advising.
The Responsible Education Mitigating Options and Technical Extensions Act, enacted in December 2021, provides COVID-19 related extensions to certain veterans education benefits and clarifies that the Isakson Roe Act Section 1018 prohibition on incentive compensation does not apply to foreign students residing outside the U.S. who are ineligible for federal student financial aid.
Institutions were generally required to be in compliance with the Isakson Roe Act by August 2021. However, the Isakson Roe Act allowed institutions to seek from the VA a one-academic-year waiver of Section 1018. Subsequently, the REMOTE Act delayed the effective date of the Isakson Roe Act’s Section 1018 requirements to August 1, 2022, and institutions were permitted to seek a one-academic-year waiver of that deadline beginning June 15, 2022. RU did not seek a waiver of the August 1, 2021 compliance deadline and believes it satisfied Section 1018 requirements by that deadline. In September 2021, APUS and HCN received waivers for the requirements of Section 1018 for the period August 1, 2021 through July 31, 2022. APUS and HCN did not seek additional waiver extensions and believe they satisfied Section 1018 requirements by July 31, 2022.
The Training in High-Demand Roles to Improve Veteran Employment Act, or the THRIVE Act, enacted in June 2021, amended provisions related to veterans education programs found in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and the Isakson Roe Act. The legislation requires the VA to work with the Department of Labor to determine the list of high-demand occupations for rapid retraining assistance, excludes programs pursued solely through distance learning on a half-time basis or less from the housing stipend available to those in the retraining program, and requires the Government Accountability Office to report on the outcomes and effectiveness of retraining programs. The legislation also requires the VA to take disciplinary action if a person with whom an institution has an agreement to provide educational or recruiting services violates the VA’s incentive compensation prohibitions.
On August 26, 2022, the President signed into law the Ensuring the Best Schools for Veterans Act of 2022, which modifies how the VA implements the rule generally forbidding use of VA benefits for students enrolling in a program in which more than 85% of students enrolled in the program have any portion of their tuition, fees, or other charges paid to or for them by the institution or by the VA, or the 85/15 Requirement. Among other things, the law clarifies that reporting associated with the 85/15 Requirement generally does not apply to institutions at which 35% or fewer students receive GI bill benefits, computed separately for the main campus and any branch or extension of the institution. The law also exempts programs for which fewer than 10 students have any portion of their tuition, fees, or other charges paid to or for them by the institution or by the VA. An institution that meets the requirements for an exemption must submit verifying information to the VA on a biennial basis.
Additional Sources of Student Payments
In addition to the Title IV, DoD, and VA programs described above, eligible students may participate in other financial aid programs or receive support from other governmental and private sources. Some of our students finance their own education or receive full or partial employer tuition reimbursement. Our institutions enter into agreements with various employers through which our institutions agree to a variety of terms, including terms related to the provision of tuition grants to eligible employees. Our institutions may offer interest free payment plans of less than 12 months to students to assist them with the financing of educational expenses. In certain circumstances, our students may access alternative loan programs from a number of private lenders, which are intended to cover the difference between what the student receives from all financial aid sources and the student’s total cost of attendance. As a condition to an institution’s participation in the Title IV programs, the institution must adopt a code of conduct pertaining to student loans, including alternative loans.
RU and HCN both offer their students an extended payment plan option. The extended payment plans are designed to assist students with educational costs including tuition and fees. The extended payment plans are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, such as the Truth in Lending Act as implemented in Regulation Z, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act 
as implemented in Regulation B and the Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Beginning January 1, 2020, HCN began offering an institutional affordability grant to students demonstrating financial need to cover the difference between the total cost of tuition and fees less the amount of all eligible financial aid resources. The grant is designed to limit a student’s monthly payment to $200 through an award of up to $200 per month, or $600 per term after consideration of financial aid, employer tuition reimbursement, and other financial resources. 
Consumer Protection
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The CFPB has pursued enforcement actions against certain for-profit institutions of higher education and has released several reports that directly address issues related to institutions of higher education. In October 2021, the CFPB Education Loan Ombudsman released its annual report analyzing approximately 1,900 private student loan complaints and approximately 3,400 federal student loan complaints received between September 1, 2020 and August 31, 2021. In October 2022, the annual report analyzed approximately 2,960 private student loan complaints (an increase of approximately 56% compared to prior-year data) and approximately 5,450 federal student loan complaints (an increase of approximately 60% compared to prior-year data). We do not know what enforcement actions the CFPB may pursue, or what steps Congress or federal agencies may take, in response to these reports and whether such actions, if any, will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
Federal Trade Commission
In October 2021, in what it termed a broad-based initiative to deter for-profit college fraud, the FTC issued informational notices to 70 for-profit higher education institutions, including APUS and RU, informing them of certain marketing practices the FTC had previously determined to be deceptive or unfair and therefore unlawful under the FTC Act. The FTC indicated that an institution’s receipt of the notice was not an indication that the institution has engaged in deceptive or unfair conduct. The informational notices were sent in furtherance of an FTC Act provision permitting penalties against those engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices with actual knowledge of their unfair or deceptive nature. The informational notices informed the institutions that engaging in such practices could subject a company to civil penalties under that provision. By providing the informational notices, the FTC is able to document that the institutions have knowledge that the FTC has found these marketing practices to be unfair or deceptive. The FTC also announced that it would be enhancing its enforcement cooperation with other agencies with oversight of educational institutions, including ED’s Office of Federal Student Aid and the VA. We do not know what enforcement actions the FTC may pursue in light of its recent informational notices and whether such actions, if any, will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
Other Issues Related to Consumer Protection and Complaints
Many states have become more active in regulating for-profit education from a consumer protection perspective, specifically related to enforcement of consumer protection laws and implementation of new regulations by state attorneys general. Actions by state attorneys general and other governmental agencies, whether or not involving us or our institutions, could damage our reputation and the reputation of our institutions and limit the ability to recruit and enroll students, which could reduce student demand for our institutions’ programs and adversely impact our revenue and cash flow from operations.
Our institutions are recipients of complaints filed with state regulatory authorities, the Better Business Bureau, and posted in online forums. Our institutions attempt to resolve such complaints in a cooperative manner. However, even if such complaints are resolved or are otherwise unfounded, they may still harm the reputation of our institutions.
On October 8, 2021, ED announced that it had restored an Office of Enforcement within ED’s Office of Federal Student Aid to strengthen oversight of and enforcement actions against postsecondary institutions that participate in federal student loan, grant, and work-study programs.
Compliance with Regulatory Standards and the Effect of Regulatory Violations
Compliance Reviews
Our institutions are subject to compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including ED, ED OIG, state licensing agencies, DoD, VA, and accrediting agencies. The HEA and ED regulations also require institutions to submit annually a compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and applicable ED OIG audit standards. In addition, to enable ED to make a determination of financial responsibility, institutions must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with ED regulations.
In September 2016, ED began a program review of APUS’s administration of the Title IV programs during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 award years. ED closed the program review in January 2021, with no findings, penalties, or requirements for further action.
In July 2017, ED began a program review of RU’s administration of Title IV program during the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 award years. In September 2022, RU received a program review report from ED that asserted 14 findings of noncompliance with Title IV rules, including rules related to Title IV administration, policies, and consumer information and reporting requirements, and the federal work study, Pell Grant, and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant programs. The program review required RU to do a review in connection with the federal work study finding, prepare policies and procedures, return small amounts of funds to two students, provide training, and take other actions in connection with the findings, and to provide a response, which RU timely provided. ED will review the response and then issue a final program review determination specifying any liabilities. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the RU program review, when it will be completed, or whether ED will place any liability or other limitations on RU as a result of the review. 
In July 2022, HCN received from ED the final program review determination from a review that had been pending since June 2017, and in September 2022 ED notified HCN that it had closed the program review and no further action was required. The review included findings of a failure to prorate fees, return of Title IV funds calculations that were not properly computed, untimely and inaccurate reporting to the National Student Loan Data System, incomplete verification, and cost of attendance formulation deficiencies. HCN was required to do a full file review in connection with the return of Title IV funds finding, to have the review tested by an independent auditor, and to prepare policies and procedures and take other actions in connection with the findings. Total liabilities were approximately $12,000.
In order to participate in TA, institutions must agree to participate in DoD’s Voluntary Education Institutional Compliance Program, or ICP. An institution that through the ICP is found noncompliant with DoD requirements and demonstrates an unwillingness to resolve a finding may be subject to a range of penalties from a written warning to termination of the institution’s participation in TA. APUS has previously been subject to ICP reviews.
Potential Effect of Regulatory Violations
If our institutions fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV programs, ED could impose one or more sanctions, including transferring our institutions to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment, seeking to require repayment of certain Title IV program funds, requiring the posting of an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of ED as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against our institutions, referring the matter for criminal prosecution, or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, condition, suspend, or terminate participation in Title IV programs. If our institution’s approval to participate in Title IV programs is terminated, it will also lose its ability to participate in TA pursuant to its DoD MOU, as well as in education benefits administered by the VA.
If such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against our institutions and resulted in a substantial curtailment, or termination, of participation in Title IV programs, this would materially and adversely affect our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.
If one of our institutions were to lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or if the amount of available Title IV program funds were reduced, we could seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students. Although we believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to students attending our institutions, there is no assurance that this would be the case, and the interest rate and other terms of such financial aid might not be as favorable as those for Title IV program funds. We may be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing alternative sources of financial aid. Accordingly, the loss of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or a reduction in the amount of available federal 
student financial aid, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even if we could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid.
In addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our institutions’ participation in Title IV programs, we also may be subject, from time to time, to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties, such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public.
Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations
Many actions that we may wish to take in connection with our operations are subject to regulation from a variety of agencies. For example, ED’s regulations, state regulatory requirements, and accrediting agency standards may, in certain instances, limit our ability to acquire or sell institutions, and to establish additional locations and programs. For example, as described in “Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements – Department of Education – Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs – Eligibility and Certification Procedures”, RU is currently subject to certain temporary growth restrictions on the institution, including imposing limitations on new programs and locations and imposing a cap on the number of students that participate in Title IV programs that can be enrolled. Many states require approval before institutions can add new programs, campuses, or teaching locations. Generally, these agencies require institutions to notify them, and sometimes require institutions to obtain their approval, in advance of opening a new location or implementing new programs. APUS is regulated by its institutional accreditor, the HLC, as well as a state agency in West Virginia. RU’s is regulated by its institutional accreditor, the HLC, as well as the six state agencies where RU physical campuses are located, which include Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin. HCN is regulated by ABHES, and the state agencies in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan.
Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control
ED’s regulations, state regulatory requirements, and accreditation standards may limit our ability to acquire, merge, or sell institutions, and may impose restrictions on activities following a transaction. For example, ED must approve any change in ownership resulting in a change of control of APEI, our institutions or any institution we may acquire. These restrictions may impede our ability to grow by acquisition, or to dispose of assets. Moreover, as a publicly traded company, the potential adverse regulatory effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance, or redemption of our stock. In addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control could discourage bids for our shares of common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares.
For example, the Rasmussen Acquisition was required to be reported to, and in some cases approved by, various education regulatory bodies. RU also pursued post-closing notices and consents related to the change in ownership. State agencies, accreditors, boards of nursing, and other relevant regulators also required further action with respect to the Rasmussen Acquisition. For example, HLC required an additional site visit within six months of the closing date of the Rasmussen Acquisition, and the visit occurred in February 2022. Additionally, some regulators required approval after the change in ownership in order to continue proper licensure, accreditation, approval, or authorization.
In addition, on January 1, 2022, APEI acquired substantially all of the assets of GSUSA for approximately $1.0 million, subject to working capital adjustments. GSUSA is licensed by the D.C. Higher Education Licensure Commission, or DCHELC, and accredited by ACCET. DCHELC and ACCET approved the transaction. 
U.S. Department of Education
An institution that undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and must apply to ED in order to reestablish such eligibility. ED regulations define what constitutes a change in ownership and control of various types of legal entities. For example, ED regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly traded company occurs in one of two ways: (i) there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing a change of control; or (ii) the corporation has a stockholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation, and that stockholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock, or ceases to be the largest stockholder. As a result, a significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock, including an acquisition resulting in a stockholder owning at least 25% of our outstanding stock, could be determined by ED to be a change in ownership and control.
The HEA provides that after an institution undergoes a change in ownership and control ED may temporarily provisionally certify the institution based on a materially complete application received within 10 business days after the change occurred. ED may continue such temporary provisional certification on a month-to-month basis until it has rendered a final decision on the institution’s application, provided the institution has timely supplied all required information and documentation. If ED approves the application, it issues a provisional certification, which extends for a period expiring not later than the end of the third complete award year following the date of provisional certification.
When a change in ownership and control occurs, ED applies certain financial tests to determine the financial responsibility of the institution under the new ownership. The institution generally is required to submit a same-day audited balance sheet reflecting the financial condition of the institution immediately following the change in ownership and control, and the same-day balance sheet must satisfy certain requirements. In addition, when a change in ownership and control occurs and there is a new owner, the institution must submit to ED the new owner’s audited financial statements for its two most recently completed fiscal years. If those audits do not satisfy ED requirements, ED may impose conditions on continued Title IV participation, such as a letter of credit, certain growth restrictions including with respect to adding locations and programs, and additional monitoring requirements. ED’s financial responsibility standards are described more fully above in “Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements – Department of Education – Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs – Financial Responsibility”.
In October 2022, ED announced final regulations relating to change in ownership and change in control rules and procedures, effective July 1, 2023. The ownership interest threshold for publicly traded corporations remains at 25%, as described above. For entities that are not closely held or publicly traded corporations, including limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, limited partnerships, and similar types of legal entities, the final regulations increase the ownership interest threshold from 25% to 50% for a change in ownership that results in a change in control automatically triggering ED’s approval process, and also provide that ED’s approval process may apply when a change in control occurs despite not meeting the 50 percent threshold. The final regulations also require institutions to notify ED and students of a planned change in ownership that results in a change in control at least 90 days in advance. In addition, the final regulations impose reporting obligations on institutions for changes in ownership that do not result in a change in control, lowering the threshold for reporting such changes from 25 percent to 5 percent ownership interest for all entity types. The final regulations also: require additional financial protection (i.e., letters of credit) when a new owner is lacking financial statements or as ED determines necessary; and eliminate the existing requirement that ED continue an institution’s participation with the same terms and conditions in their Title IV agreement as prior to the transaction. In addition, the final regulations define “main campus” and modify the definitions of “additional location” and “branch campus” to clarify that a location must be within the same “ownership structure” of the institution.
State Regulatory Agencies
Many states require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status. The types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary, but many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change of control requiring approval. A change of control may require us to obtain approval of the change in ownership and control in order to maintain our state approval. In certain circumstances, state approving agencies responsible for oversight of veterans education benefits also may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control. 
Accreditors
Many accrediting agencies, including HLC, require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval for certain changes in legal status, ownership, form of control, or other aspects of institutional status, but the types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary. Many accrediting agencies also require on-site evaluations to confirm the appropriateness of any approval. Some accrediting agencies’ oversight may also extend to defined changes that occur in an institution’s parent or controlling entity, and not necessarily the institution itself. Such oversight could trigger additional reviews of the institution and possible change in accreditation status.
Should we attempt to enter into transactions with institutions accredited by other accreditors, we would be required to follow the requirements of such accreditors. Our management may not have experience with the accreditors of the target institution, which would increase the risks related to such a transaction and management of the institution subsequent to the transaction.
Restrictions on Adding Locations and Educational Programs
ED may, as a condition of participation in Title IV programs, require prior approval of new locations, programs, or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add. ED’s regulations require institutions to report and, in certain cases (such as when an institution is provisionally certified such as ours), to seek approval for a new additional campus location at which at least 50% of a program will be offered if the institution wants to disburse Title IV program funds to students enrolled at that location. Institutions are responsible for knowing whether they need approval, and institutions that add locations and programs and disburse Title IV program funds in connection with those locations and programs without having obtained any necessary approval may be subject to administrative repayments and other sanctions.
The HEA requires for-profit institutions to be in full operation for two years before qualifying to participate in Title IV programs. However, ED regulations in many circumstances permit an institution that is already qualified to participate in Title IV programs to establish additional campus locations that are exempt from the two-year rule. The new campus location must satisfy all other applicable requirements for institutional eligibility, including approval by the relevant state authorizing agency and the institution’s accrediting agency.
Provisionally certified institutions of higher education such as ours, and institutions on HCM1 like RU, must seek prior approval from ED to offer new academic programs eligible for Title IV program funds and to open new locations at which Title IV program funds will be disbursed. A fully certified degree-granting institution generally is not obligated to obtain ED’s prior approval for a new location, an additional program leading to a degree at the same level previously approved by ED, or a new program that both prepares students for gainful employment in the same or related recognized occupation as an education program that has previously been designated as an eligible program at that institution and meets certain minimum-length requirements. However, ED could nevertheless require a fully certified institution to obtain prior approval for new programs and locations for purposes of Title IV program participation.
Other Regulations
GSUSA’s contracts are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, a regulatory framework. The FAR affects how GSUSA interacts and does business with its federal government clients, including by providing government agencies with rights not typically found in commercial contracts. Our government contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. In addition, we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to these contracts, and any violations could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refund or suspension of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. Information about risks associated with GSUSA’s contracts being governed by the FAR is provided in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
Other Recent Legislative and Regulatory Activity
Many of our students rely on federally funded programs, including Title IV programs, TA and education benefits administered by the VA that may be affected by changes in the federal budget. Due to the substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through Title IV programs, TA and education benefits administered by the VA, the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs, and significant political interest in the cost of education, Congress continues to show interest in regulation and oversight of institutions of higher education, especially those that are for-profit.
In addition, ED held negotiated rulemaking sessions from January through March 2022 to address other topics for which proposed or final regulations have not yet been issued, including ability to benefit provisions, certification procedures for participation in Title IV programs, financial responsibility requirements, gainful employment program requirements, and standards of administrative capability.
