ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Overview
 
Co-Diagnostics, Inc. (“Company,” or “CDI,”) is developing robust and innovative molecular tools for detection of infectious diseases, liquid biopsy for cancer screening, and agricultural applications.
 
Our diagnostics systems enable very rapid, low-cost, molecular testing for organisms and genetic diseases by automating historically complex procedures in both the development and administration of tests. CDI’s newest technical advance involves a novel approach to PCR test design (“Co-Primers”) that eliminates one of the key vexing issues of PCR amplification, the exponential growth of primer-dimer pairs (false positives and false negatives) which adversely interferes with identification of the target DNA.
 
Our proprietary molecular diagnostics technology is paving the way for innovation in disease detection and life sciences research through our enhanced detection of genetic material. Because we own our platform, we are able to accomplish this faster and more economically, allowing for wider margins while still positioning Co-Diagnostics to be a low-cost provider of molecular diagnostics and screening services.
 
The Company, a Utah corporation, is a molecular diagnostics company that has developed and intends to manufacture and sell reagents used for diagnostic tests that function via the detection and/or analysis of nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA). In connection with the sale of our tests we may sell diagnostic equipment from other manufacturers as self-contained lab systems (which we refer to as the “MDx device”).
 
In addition, continued development has demonstrated the unique properties of our Co-Primer technology that make them ideally suited to a variety of applications where specificity is key to optimal results, including multiplexing several targets, enhanced Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (“SNP”) detection and enrichment for next gen sequencing.
 
Our scientists were the first to understand the complex mathematics of DNA test design, to “engineer” a DNA test and to automate algorithms that rapidly screen millions of possible options to pinpoint the optimum design. Dr. Satterfield, our Chief Technology Officer, developed the Company’s intellectual property consisting of the predictive mathematical algorithms and proprietary reagents used in the testing process, which together represent a major advance in Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR”) testing systems. CDI technologies are now protected by five granted or pending US patents, as well as certain trade secrets and copyrights. Ownership of our proprietary platform permits us the advantage of avoiding payment of patent royalties required by other PCR test systems, which grants us the opportunity of selling diagnostic tests at a lower price than competitors, while generating a profit margin.
 
We may either sell or lease portable and in some cases OEM laboratory equipment to existing diagnostic centers and sell the reagents that comprise our proprietary tests to those laboratories and other testing facilities.
 
We designed our tests by identifying the optimal locations on the target gene for amplification and paired the location with the optimized primer and probe structure to achieve outputs that meet the design input requirements identified from market research. This is done by following planned and documented processes, procedures and testing. In other words, the data resulting from our tests verify that we succeeded in designing what we intended to at the outset. Verification is a series of testing that concludes that the product is ready to proceed to validation in a clinical evaluation setting using initial production tests to confirm that the product as designed meets the user needs.
 
Using its proprietary test design system and proprietary reagents, CDI will design and sell PCR diagnostic tests for diseases and pathogens starting with tests for tuberculosis, a drug resistant tuberculosis test, hepatitis B and C, Malaria, dengue, HIV and Zika virus, all of which tests have been designed and verified in CDI’s laboratory. Our tuberculosis test, Zika test, and a triplex test for Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya received a CE Marks in 2018 and qualifying our test to be sold throughout the European community and in most countries in central and South America.

Infectious Disease Product Offering
 
We plan to manufacture molecular diagnostic tests for the following diseases in the following regions, to be sold along with the MDx device:
 

Timetable | Region | Tests 
--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current (revenues in the 1st quarter in 2019) | Caribbean and Central and South America | Zika, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C, Dengue, Zika/Dengue/Chikungunya triplex 
 | India | Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C, Malaria, Dengue and HIV 
2019-2020 | European Union; Asia | Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C 
2020-2025 | United States | To be determined based on need and regulatory barriers 

Caribbean and Central and South America
 
Our initial sales will be to entities within the Caribbean Public Health Agency Members States (Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, BES Islands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Curacao, Dominica, Grenada, Haiti, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St Maarten, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands).
 
In some of these countries, there are no regulatory hurdles and we can start offering our tests immediately. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted permission for us to export many of our products. The FDA’s permission to export was granted under Section 801(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the “FDC Act”). Section 801(e) of the FDA Act covers certain medical devices that have not yet received an approved Premarket Approval in the United States by the FDA, such as our products. We have not commenced any Premarket Approval steps with the FDA. Section 801(e) applies to medical devices that are acceptable to the importing country and that are manufactured under the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices.
 
We first offered our Zika test in this region because of the demand for such test, followed quickly by tests for tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, and dengue, then our full range of tests. Products will be manufactured for sale upon receipt of purchase orders from labs and hospitals.
 
India
 
The Company has entered into an agreement to manufacture diagnostics tests for seven infectious diseases with a pharmaceutical manufacturing company in India. The agreement provides for the manufacture of the tests named above and the joint sales and marketing of those tests in India. We have commenced with our joint venture partner to construct a plant that will be used for testing and manufacturing to service the Indian market. We believe that the plant will be completed and manufacturing activities will begin in the second quarter of 2019.
 
Since the tests will be conducted in India on Indian citizens, no FDA approval or inspection will be required. Certain Indian regulatory approval from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) must be acquired. We are engaging the services of an experienced consultant in India to help get us through this process. Research Use Only (RUO) reagents are able to be sold without requiring regulatory approval as long as they are labeled and designated as such. Tests for some of the targeted diseases are available for sale currently in India. We have received test licenses from the CDSCO for the following tests: tuberculosis, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, malaria, and a drug resistance test for tuberculosis. We will complete additional testing and then apply for manufacturing and sales licenses for these tests.
 
India is the country with the highest burden of tuberculosis. World Health Organization (WHO) tuberculosis statistics for India for 2015 give an estimated incidence figure of 2.2 million cases of tuberculosis for India out of a global incidence of 9.6 million. The tuberculosis incidence for India is the number of new cases of active tuberculosis disease in India during a certain time period (usually a year).

Europe
 
Molecular diagnostics, such as our tests, are governed in Europe by the framework for in vitro diagnostics (IVDs), which encompasses diagnostic products such as reagents, instruments and systems intended for use in diagnosis of disease. The regulatory system for IVDs is built largely on a self-certification procedure, placing heavy responsibility on manufacturers. Non self-certified products are subject to the same standards as self-certified products but are subject to audit and review by a notified body prior to receiving approval to be CE-marked. A CE-marking is a manufacturer’s declaration that a product meets the requirements of the applicable European Commission directive. Examples of current obligations include having in place a qualitative manufacturing process, user instructions that are clear and fit for purpose, ensuring that the ‘physical’ features of devices and diagnostics do not pose any danger. If a product fulfils these and other related control requirements, it may be CE-marked as an indication that the product is compliant with EU legislation and sold in the European Union. We received CE Marks for our tuberculosis test, our Zika test, and our zika, dengue, chikungunya triplex test in 2018.
 
We have received ISO 13485 and ISO 9001 certifications relating to the design and manufacture of our medical device products. The ISO certification indicates that we meet the standards required to self-certify certain of our products and affix a CE-marking for sales of our products in countries accepting the CE marking (not in the United States) with only minimal further governmental approvals in each country. We estimate the remaining costs for CE-marks on the initial tests we will offer to be approximately $100,000.
 
United States
 
We do not anticipate offering our tests in the United States in the near future. We believe, however, our tests may be able to qualify as Laboratory Developed Tests (LDT’s), diagnostic tests that are developed and manufactured by CLIA certified laboratories. These tests are developed by the lab for use only in that laboratory. CLIA laboratories develop the performance characteristics, perform the analytical validation for their LDT’s and obtain licenses to offer them as diagnostic services. The FDA has publicly announced its intention to regulate certain LDTs in a phased-in approach, but draft guidance that was published a couple of years ago was withdrawn at the end of the Obama administration and replaced by an informal non-enforceable discussion paper reflecting some of the feedback that it received on LDT regulation.
Market Opportunity
 
The molecular diagnostics market is a fast-growing portion of the in vitro (test tube based, controlled environment) diagnostics market. Using estimates of the incidence of disease by the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and other international health agencies and sources, the Company estimates that the global annual demand for our initial diagnostic tests could be as much as follows:

Tuberculosis | 10,400,000 | HIV | 36,700,000 
----------------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------+--------------
Multi-drug resistant Tuberculosis | 580,000 | Malaria | 214,000,000 
Zika | 324,000,000 | Sexually Transmitted Illnesses | 357,000,000 
Hepatitis B | 240,000,000 | Human papilloma virus | 291,000,000 
Hepatitis C | 130,000,000 | Dengue | 390,000,000 
Total Annual Tests | | | 1,993,680,000

 
There are several advantages of molecular tests, such as the ones we market and sell, over other forms of diagnostic testing, which include higher sensitivities, the ability to perform multiplex tests and the ability to test for drug resistance or individual genes.
 
Competitive Advantages of Co-Diagnostics
 
We believe that we have the following competitive advantages:
 

● | Affordability: Lower-cost test kits and low-cost MDx-device. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Flexibility: CDI’s tests have been designed to run on many vendors’ DNA diagnostic testing machines. These tests are particularly well suited to the new generation of “lab-on-a-chip” and “point-of-care” (“LOC and POC”), highly portable analysis machinery for field, clinic and office applications. 
● | Speed: We believe our rapid assay design system software provides shorter time to product release. 
● | Accuracy: We believe our tests are more accurate than competitors’ and can detect more strains of viruses. 
● | Exclusivity: CDI owns all patents and all intellectual property used in preparation of its tests.

● | Personalized Medicine: We project that rising health care costs in developed and developing nations will increasingly require that health care systems be patient specific to eliminate waste, misdiagnoses, and ineffectiveness. A critical component will be accurate, more affordable DNA-based diagnostics, which CDI plans to offer. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Low-cost Provider: We plan to keep the Company’s overhead low. Its platform technology obviates the need to pay patent royalties typically required of its competitors, which use patented test platforms to design their tests. 
● | Worldwide Footprint: With a dynamic technology that encompasses markets worldwide, the Company anticipates that it can identify the best target markets, not only in high burden developing countries (HBDC’s) but also in developed nations. 
● | Growth Industry Category: We believe that DNA testing is the fastest-growing segment of in-vitro diagnostic testing. 
● | Combination Product Offering: CDI’s ultra-sensitive tests can be a well-designed match for a new generation of handheld and other small point-of-care devices now entering the market. Used together, these affordable tests and devices may revolutionize the molecular diagnostics industry in cost, speed of test results and simplification. 
● | Multi-plexing: Our initial development efforts have demonstrated that our Co-Primer designed tests will be able to test for multiple targets in the same sample without the distortion caused by false negatives and false positives that generally occur in multiplexed tests. 

Liquid Biopsy for Cancer Screening
 
The development of the liquid biopsy test will spur low cost testing in many developing countries. We believe that our liquid biopsy cancer screening shall be ready for testing in 2019 if we have sufficient development resources to dedicate to the project. Medical applications of our SNP detection technology can determine the presence of cancer cells or cell-free genetic material in a liquid or tissue biopsy, and to determine the distinct type of cancer involved. A real-life example of this includes being able to identify specific mutation(s) in genes linked to breast cancer in order to determine a patient’s prognosis, initiate the most effective and affordable treatment and to determine whether chemotherapy is necessary.
 
Our technology has for all practical purposes essentially eliminated, primer-dimers, which opens up some very unique applications for liquid biopsy for cancer detection. Our ability to multiplex the reaction in testing for several DNA targets allows technicians to detect multiple cancers as free-circulating DNA fragments or whole cells in a blood sample at the same time
 
Agricultural Applications
 
SNP detection is also used in the agricultural industry to identify variations in crop genomes to achieve improved seed viability and other desired characteristics, including drought resistance, disease resistance, pest resistance and higher yield.
 
In mid-2017, the Company was first approached by a large agribusiness to evaluate our ability to multiplex certain target genomes. The results of the development project have been to successfully demonstrate our ability to not only multiplex the target genomes, but targeted SNP’s as well. The project was undertaken in conjunction with the manufacturer of our CoPrimer tests. The results of the project encouraged the parent of our manufacturer to seek a world-wide licensing arrangement for our CoPrimers in the agricultural industry, which was completed in October 2018. Pursuant to the exclusive license for the agrigenomics industry, the licensee will pay us a royalty for all CoPrimers sold to the licensee’s customers. In January 2019, the licensee formally introduced the product at a large agricultural conference and has branded the product it will sell as BHQCoPrimers.
 
Additional Licensing and Assay Development In addition, the unique properties of our CoPrimer technology make them ideally suited to a variety of applications where sensitivity is key to optimal results, including multiplexing several targets, enhanced SNP detection and enrichment for next gen sequencing. Because of these unique characteristics of CoPrimers, research companies and institutions have requested that we design diagnostics to locate and identify uncommon gene sequences and SNPs and create tests for the target sequences in a multiplexed reaction. This application of our technology is in its beginning stages, but we believe that the results from our initial research indicate a significant step forward in defining the capabilities of our technology, which we believe can be translated to revenue producing licensing arrangements.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of July 12, 2017, the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”); (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under applicable SEC rules. We expect that we will remain an emerging growth company for the foreseeable future, but cannot retain our emerging growth company status indefinitely. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 herein as the “JOBS Act”. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from specified disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:

● | being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | not being required to comply with the requirement of auditor attestation of our internal controls over financial reporting; 
● | not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; 
● | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and 
● | not being required to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

 
For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we expect that we will take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations available to us as a result of that classification. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock.
 
An emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will not be required to adopt new or revised accounting standards on the dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public reporting companies.
 
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure available for smaller reporting companies.
