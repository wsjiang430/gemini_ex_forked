Overview




EVgo is a leader in charging solutions, building and operating the infrastructure and tools needed to expedite the mass adoption of electric vehicles for individual drivers, rideshare and commercial fleets, and businesses. Since its founding in 2010, EVgo has led the way to a cleaner transportation future and its network has been powered by 100% renewable energy since 2019 through the purchase of renewable energy certificates. As one of the nation’s largest public fast charging networks, EVgo’s owned and operated charging network of approximately 900 fast charging locations services over 60 metropolitan areas and 30 states. EVgo continues to add more DC fast charging locations through EVgo eXtend, its white label service offering. EVgo is accelerating transportation electrification through partnerships with automakers, fleet and rideshare operators, retail hosts such as grocery stores, shopping centers, and gas stations, policy leaders, and other organizations. With a rapidly growing network, robust software products and unique service offerings for drivers and partners including EVgo Optima, EVgo Inside, EVgo Rewards, and Autocharge+, EVgo enables a world-class charging experience where drivers live, work, travel and play. 
EVgo has a flexible business model that derives value through multiple revenue streams. The foundation of the Company’s business is the development and operation of EV charging sites through which it dispenses electricity to EVs driven by individuals, commercial drivers and fleet operators. EVgo is prioritizing the build out of ultra-fast chargers, a key market segment that is expected to grow faster than the overall EV charging market. See “— Suppliers and Service Providers — Electricity.” To take advantage of the expected rapid growth in the number of EVs on the road in the United States, the Company is rapidly expanding its network of charging stations, focusing on development of locations with favorable traffic, utilization and financial return characteristics. The Company’s proprietary technology and analytical tools, along with its extensive commercial partnerships with OEMs, fleets and governments, provide a strong competitive edge as it selects, designs and develops new charging stations. Furthermore, EVgo’s robust underwriting standards require its portfolio to meet or exceed a pre-defined internal rate of return before project approval. 
EVgo’s partnerships and collaboration with a wide range of automotive OEMs, rideshare operators and other channel partners are designed to incentivize and accelerate EV adoption across the U.S. Through these partnerships, EVgo’s network has powered more than 400 million electric miles as of December 31, 2022. Total miles delivered is equal to the number of kWh EVgo has dispensed multiplied by the number of miles the average EV receives from a single kWh (“vehicle efficiency”). The weighted average vehicle efficiency from all vehicles compatible with the EVgo network in operation at the end of each year is based on 2022 data from Experian and the U.S. Department of Energy. The weighted average vehicle efficiency is applied to the EVgo kWh dispensed in the associated period.
EVgo also serves the rapidly growing EV fleet segment. The Company develops and deploys fleet-charging solutions for light-, medium- and heavy-duty EV fleets. Reliable and flexible charging is essential to fleet electrification. EVgo is developing, building, operating and servicing charging assets for fleets at their own depot locations, at off-site charging hubs that EVgo has secured, or via EVgo’s expansive public network. In addition, EVgo is able to integrate proprietary EVgo Optima software to connect to a fleet’s logistics platform. To date, fleet contracts have often included guaranteed payment streams in exchange for guaranteed network access, which benefits both EVgo and a fleet operator. Whether EVgo retains ownership of the charging infrastructure itself, depends on the terms and conditions of the commercial arrangement with the particular fleet customer. 
To accelerate its network expansion and increase customer reach, EVgo also offers a white label solution – EVgo eXtend – that helps partners invest in and build EV charging stations for their customers. Through EVgo eXtend, EVgo leverages its decade-plus track record of operational experience and site design, helping businesses develop charging assets that are serviced through EVgo’s national network (and often co-branded). EVgo eXtend generates revenue from the site development, equipment delivery, engineering and construction of the stations, as well as ongoing revenue through operations, networking and maintenance of those sites.

In addition to the provision of EV charging infrastructure, EVgo is continuing to develop and deploy innovative software-based, value-added services to drivers and partners. These offerings enhance the customer experience across EVgo’s business segments by layering proprietary technology functionality on top of its leading charging network, with the intention of widening EVgo’s competitive advantage and providing accretive revenue streams. To date, EVgo has developed and deployed time-of-use per kWh pricing across its California public network, expanded the EVgo Reservations offering to more metropolitan markets across the U.S., launched multiple new subscription plans nationwide (EVgo Basic and EVgo PlusMAX) and extended its EVgo Rewards driver loyalty program. EVgo Advantage is EVgo’s proprietary technology that delivers on-the-spot promotions from local businesses to EV drivers when they plug-in and start charging. In 2022 EVgo closed two additional EVgo Advantage partnerships which now cover more than 20 EVgo locations.
EVgo also has a customizable mobile app to make charging simple for EV drivers, delivering a user experience that makes switching to an EV more inviting. To improve the customer charging experience, in 2022 EVgo developed and launched Autocharge+, which allows customers to use their EV as both identification and authentication of a charging event by allowing customers to register eligible EVs with EVgo. Customers who enable this feature can simply drive up to an EVgo station, plug in their EV, and start charging. Since launch there has been a steady increase in the percentage of charging sessions initiated via Autocharge+. Further, this capability is supported by Teslas using the newly-available CCS1 adaptor, enabling EVgo to offer drivers of many Tesla models a similar experience to their native Tesla charging network upon registering their EVs with EVgo. EVgo also extended EVgo’s ability to attract, enroll, and retain customers through the development of EVgo Inside, which provides a suite of application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that enable a third party to embed the complete EVgo experience into their branded applications and launched this capability with GM, Toyota, and Lyft.
EVgo also owns PlugShare, which is the leading global platform for EV drivers to locate and provide information relating to charging stations and provide feedback on their charging experiences, while leveraging tools like Pay with PlugShare and EV Trip Planner. Beyond its services to EV drivers, PlugShare delivers data to automakers and other customers through the PlugShare API and manages the world’s largest EV driver research panel through PlugInsights. PlugShare also delivers advertising impressions globally on behalf of its advertising customers. In 2022 EVgo expanded Pay with PlugShare to include a portion of the EVgo network, launched a PlugShare Premium service, and increased advertising inventory and capabilities across the platform.

Market Overview


The EV charging market is inextricably linked to the general market for EVs, which has experienced significant recent growth. For the year end December 31, 2022, new battery EV sales in the United States were approximately 812,000, an increase of 65% compared to 2021, according to Cox Automotive. Market growth is driven by tailwinds such as increased EV model availability and performance, lower upfront prices for EVs, lower total cost of ownership (“TCO”) as compared to internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles, increased range and availability of chargers and federal, state and local incentives and regulations. In response to the growing electrification trend, nearly all major automobile manufacturers have committed to the production of EV models, with over 60 EV models anticipated to be available in 2023 from over 30 manufacturers and nearly a dozen more models coming onto the market soon. Additionally, major automobile manufacturers have set aggressive targets for EV sales, with General Motors (“GM”) announcing aims to phase out ICE vehicle sales by 2035, Ford planning on 40% to 50% of its global vehicle volume to be all-electric by 2030, and Mercedes-Benz and Volvo each committing to be all electric by 2030. According to forecasts from the United States Department of Transportation and Bloomberg New Energy Finance (“BNEF”), approximately eight million EVs are expected to be on American roads by 2025, nearly 34 million EVs by 2030 and over 125 million by 2040, which would represent approximately 50% of all motor vehicles in the U.S.
Automobile and battery manufacturers have substantially increased their efforts to offer EVs at a wide range of price points and to develop batteries with higher efficiencies and lower costs. According to a 2022 report by Reuters, $1.2 trillion is expected to be spent on EV investment through 2030 by global automobile OEMs. Their investments are expected to expand and put EVs and their associated technologies into mass production, which in turn is expected to underpin optimization of the global EV supply chain. Efforts to date by OEMs have already lowered the upfront costs of EVs, with further price reductions expected over the next several model years. As measured in terms of TCO, certain classes of EVs are already at or below parity with their ICE counterparts. As overall EV costs decline, it is expected that greater numbers of EV models will reach TCO parity with their ICE equivalents and that the TCO advantage for other types of EVs will expand.

In addition to price and TCO declines, widespread adoption of EVs will require consumer confidence in vehicle range, charger availability and increased model choice. Newer EV models, including the Chevrolet Bolt EUV, Toyota bZ4X, Nissan Ariya, Subaru Solterra, Ford F-150 Lightning, BMW i4, Hyundai Ioniq5, Kia EV6, VW ID.4, Audi Q4 e-tron, Rivian R1S, Volvo C40 Recharge and Tesla Models 3/Y/S/X, have eclipsed 200 miles of range on a full charge, a significant improvement to earlier EV models. Researchers and automotive engineers expect that EV ranges will continue to improve as battery technologies advance and costs decline over time. Beyond increases in range, broadly expanded EV offerings in the sport utility vehicle (“SUV”), crossover utility vehicle and pickup truck segments over the next three to five years are expected to greatly expand the market appeal and reach of EVs and further accelerate adoption of EVs.









These advances are further supported by incentives and rebates offered by federal, state and local governments to encourage the adoption of EVs. In November 2021, Congress passed and the President signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Among other provisions, this legislation included up to $7.5 billion in funding for EV charging infrastructure through the Department of Transportation. The U.S. federal government previously offered a tax credit for qualified plug-in EVs with a minimum credit of $2,500 and a maximum credit of $7,500, depending on vehicle weight and battery capacity. In August 2022, the President signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), which modified and extended the previous EV tax credit and created new tax credits for previously owned EVs and commercial vehicles. The legislation included new domestic content and critical mineral sourcing requirements and eliminated a cap on the availability of tax credits for individuals who purchased vehicles from OEMs that had reached certain production levels. The IRA also expanded, extended, and introduced new eligibility requirements for the tax credit for electric vehicle service equipment (“EVSE”) under Section 30C of the Code. States including California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York also offer various rebates, grants and tax credits to incentivize both EV purchases or leases, and pursuant to the IIJA, funding will soon become available for EVSE nationwide through grant programs administered by state departments of transportation.






Demand for EVs has also been encouraged by regulatory developments and changes in consumer habits. Several states — including California, Oregon, New Jersey, New York, Maryland and Massachusetts — have adopted or proposed mandates for EVs, and California alone has set an aggregate goal of more than seven million EVs on the road by 2030, which, by California Energy Commission estimates, will require 1.2 million private and shared public chargers. 

10



Additionally, California has enacted its Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program (the “Clean Miles Standard”) aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation networking companies (“TNCs”), such as rideshare vehicles, through electrification and other means. In 2021, California also finalized the Advanced Clean Truck (“ACT”) rule, a regulation that requires an increasing percentage of medium- and heavy-duty trucks sold in the state to be zero emissions. States such as Washington, New York, New Jersey and Oregon have also adopted the ACT rule. These regulations, combined with a shift toward car-sharing and mobility as a service offering, will rapidly accelerate EV adoption by fleets in the coming years.






















EV charging demand is a direct result of the number of EVs operating during a given period, miles traveled by such EVs and vehicle efficiency of such EVs. The market for fulfilling charging demand is bifurcated between high-powered DC fast and ultra-fast charging and lower powered Level 1 (defined below) and Level 2 (defined below) charging. The demand for different charging types is a function of the EV mix, owner demographics, locational factors, charger availability, pricing and EV use cases (e.g., private ownership, rideshare, commercially and municipally owned fleets, etc.). Lower-powered Level 1 and Level 2 charging is primarily used by EV owners with access to home or workplace charging and currently accounts for the majority of personal EV charging. Level 2 charging is also used by certain fleets that have the ability to charge overnight, have a low daily mileage requirement and return to a centralized location daily. Current DCFC customers are primarily those drivers who need to charge away from home in central business districts, those drivers who do not have access to home or workplace charging, or high-mileage fleets that seek to minimize downtime and maximize miles traveled.













Broadening demographics of EV owners, larger battery sizes, larger EVs with higher kWh usage per mile, increased EV penetration in medium- and heavy-duty vehicle applications, increasing adoption of rideshare and last-mile delivery services, and the proliferation of autonomous vehicle fleets are expected to increase demand for DCFC faster than demand for overall EV charging. According to forecasts from BNEF, fast charging is expected to constitute more than 25% of all public EV charging demand by 2030 as compared to less than 15% in 2021.
While EVs are more readily available and may benefit from first-mover, supply chain and infrastructure availability advantages relative to other non-ICE vehicles, several alternative vehicle types are also being developed which rely on hydrogen, biodiesel or hybrid powertrains for alternatives to fossil fuels. Sales of such vehicles may reduce the number of drivers requiring EV charging infrastructure.
EV Chargers and Standards

Working with the charger manufacturing industry, EVgo has specified and deployed a next generation DC fast charging station architecture whereby modular power units are placed under software management and control, allowing power output to be shared dynamically between vehicles that are simultaneously connected to a charger. EVgo has successfully deployed this architecture and demonstrated that this dynamic power sharing technology reduces upfront capital and ongoing operating costs, maximizing return on investment, while increasing operational flexibility and lowering operating risk. This advanced architecture allows EVgo to meet increasing charging requirements of the future, including higher charging speeds, higher power provisioning, dynamic energy and demand management, access prioritization, queuing management and scheduling across different EV models, customer types and use cases. This modular software-defined design maximizes charger throughput, asset utilization and ease of future power augmentation while eliminating single points of failure risks and improving charger reliability and availability. It also maximizes the number of standardized equipment components, helping to accelerate the learning rate benefits and associated cost reductions of charging hardware over time and improving the ability to offer higher value-added service offerings in the future.
As EVs proliferate in the transportation ecosystem, the industry is experiencing an ongoing shift toward the standardization of chargers and the introduction of new industry protocols for interoperability.

EV chargers do not come with a “one size fits all” dispenser. EV chargers are typically categorized by their ability to deliver instantaneous amounts of power — as measured in kWs — and their charging standards. Current designations based on power level include:

● | DCFCs. DCFCs operate between 200 and 1000V DC and supply at least 50kW. DCFCs are almost exclusively available in public locations or commercial applications and are capable of adding range of 100 miles in as little as five to 10 minutes, where the actual charge rate is capped by the charging capabilities of the particular EV’s charging profile (with lower capability and older EV models requiring 30 minutes or more for equivalent range) or the DCFC’s maximum charging profile. As of December 31, 2022, EVgo’s network included 2,184 DCFCs at over 900 locations — one of the largest public DC fast charging networks in the U.S. EVgo’s network has been powered by 100% renewable electricity since 2019 through the purchase of RECs. See “— Governmental Regulation — Renewable Energy Markets.”
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Level 2 AC Chargers. Level 2 chargers operate at 208V or 240V AC and supply between 3.6-19.2 kW. A Level 2 charger will not charge a battery as quickly as a DCFC, providing up to 20 miles of range per hour of charging. Level 2 chargers are often found in homes, workplaces and long dwell time public locations. EVgo currently operates over 1,200 Level 2 AC chargers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Level 1 AC Chargers. Level 1 chargers offer the least amount of power, as they operate at 120V AC, supplying between 1.2-2.4 kW. This is consistent with the power level offered through a standard household outlet. Such chargers can generally provide approximately 4-10 miles of range per hour. EVgo’s network does not contain any Level 1 chargers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to supporting different charging capabilities, EVs in the U.S. use different charging standards and connector types. These standards are neither interchangeable nor interoperable (without specialized adaptors), and each utilizes a unique connector. Presently, all EV charging standards deliver energy through cables that connect the EV charging station directly to the vehicle using a port located on the exterior of the vehicle. There are currently three standards in use in the U.S. — CCS, CHAdeMO and Tesla.

● | CCS. The CCS standard is utilized by EVs manufactured by U.S. OEMs (excluding Tesla) and European OEMs. OEMs that produce CCS-enabled vehicles include GM, Ford and BMW. The CCS standard provides for both AC and DC charging.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | CHAdeMO. The CHAdeMO standard has been utilized by EVs manufactured by Japanese OEMs. OEMs producing CHAdeMO-enabled vehicles include Nissan, Honda and Toyota. The CHAdeMO standard is being phased out in North America and Nissan and Toyota have introduced the next generation of their EVs in the United States utilizing the CCS standard. The CHAdeMO standard provides for DC charging.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tesla. In 2022, Tesla released their CCS adaptor that is capable of reaching the full 250kW supported by current generation Tesla EVs; however, not all Tesla’s in operation support this adaptor, with some requiring a hardware update to the EV itself that will not be available until 2023. Adding this CCS adaptor to EVgo’s deployed Tesla Connectors (based on the CHAdeMO adaptor) makes EVgo’s network more accessible to Tesla drivers. In 2022, Tesla also opened their proprietary connector and cable to the market under the name of the North American Charging Standard (“NACS”). At present, Tesla has provided the technical specifications of the air-cooled and 500V DC versions only, limiting the capability of sustained high-powered charging. Tesla did not open their proprietary charging communications protocol; therefore, non-Tesla charging stations chargers will communicate through the CCS communications protocols.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EVgo’s chargers support each of the fast charging standards described above. Most of EVgo’s charging stations contain both CCS and CHAdeMO cables with some of its more recent charging stations including only CCS cables. Additionally, certain EVgo charging sites offer integrated Tesla charging, allowing Tesla drivers to charge without needing a separate adaptor. With Tesla’s release of the CCS1 adaptor, all of EVgo’s CCS stations are now accessible to Tesla drivers, and with EVgo’s Autocharge+, EVgo can deliver the same plug and charge experience to Tesla drivers that they 

12



have on the Tesla super charger network. Continuing to develop access to seamless, integrated charging for all EV drivers is a core commitment of EVgo.
Products and Services

Retail Charging
The Company sells electricity directly to drivers who access EVgo’s publicly available networked chargers. Various pricing plans exist for customers and drivers have the choice to charge as members (with monthly fees and reduced per minute or kWh pricing and other benefits such as reservations), through a subscription service, or as non-members, paying a full tariff for each session. Drivers locate the chargers through EVgo’s mobile application, their vehicle’s in-dash navigation system, or third-party databases, such as PlugShare, that license charger-location information from EVgo. EVgo’s chargers are generally installed in parking spaces owned or leased by commercial or public-entity property owners, landlords and/or tenants (collectively, the “Site Hosts”) that desire to provide charging services at their respective locations. Commercial Site Hosts include retail and grocery stores, offices, medical complexes, airports and convenience stores. EVgo’s offerings are well aligned with the goals of Site Hosts, as many commercial businesses increasingly view charging capabilities as essential to attracting tenants, employees, customers and visitors and achieve sustainability goals. Site Hosts are generally able to obtain these benefits at no cost when partnering with EVgo through the Company’s owner and/or operator model, in which EVgo is responsible for the development, construction and operation of chargers located on Site Hosts’ properties. In many cases, Site Hosts will earn revenue from license payments in the form of parking space rental fees that EVgo pays in exchange for use of the site. EVgo also offers a white label solution – EVgo eXtend – that enables Site Hosts to invest in EV charging stations for their customers that are operated and maintained by EVgo.

Other related services EVgo currently provides to OEMs include co-marketing, data services and digital application services. EVgo’s OEM relationships are a core customer-acquisition channel.

Commercial Charging
Fleet and Rideshare Public Charging. High volume fleet customers, such as TNCs or delivery services, can access charging infrastructure through EVgo’s vast public network. Pricing for charging services is most often negotiated directly with the fleet owner based on the business needs and usage patterns of the fleet. In these arrangements, EVgo contracts with and bills, either the fleet owner directly or an individual fleet driver utilizing EVgo’s chargers. Access to the EVgo public network allows fleet and rideshare operators to support mass adoption of transportation electrification and achieve sustainability goals without needing to directly invest capital in charging infrastructure or incur operating costs associated with charging equipment.
Fleet Dedicated Charging. In addition to offering access to its public network, EVgo offers dedicated charging solutions to fleets. Given the diverse nature of the fleet segment, with a wide range of vehicle types, duty cycles, geographic footprints, fleet sizes and capitalization of the fleet operators, EVgo’s dedicated charging solutions are tailored to meet each fleet’s needs. Through its fleet product, EVgo develops, builds, and services charging assets for fleets either at their own depot locations or at off-site charging hubs that EVgo has secured without requiring a fleet to directly incur capital expenditures. EVgo offers turnkey charging solutions to fleets that EVgo builds, owns and operates or that EVgo sells to the fleet customer bundled with networking and other services. EVgo offers a variety of pricing models for dedicated charging solutions, including a mix of volumetric commitments and variable and fixed payments for provision of charging services. Together, EVgo’s dedicated charging solutions and public fleet charging services provide fleets with charging infrastructure options that are robust and flexible as the transition to electrified transportation accelerates.

EVgo continues to evaluate and engage in opportunities to use its foundational expertise in charging infrastructure to provide value-added services to the rapidly growing EV ecosystem while delivering shareholder returns.

Market Opportunity & Strategy

The U.S. EV market has recently experienced significant growth and the market share of EVs was approximately 6% of all vehicle sales in 2022. As adoption accelerates and the market continues to scale, the availability of appropriate charging infrastructure will be critical to enabling consumer and commercial adoptions of EVs. Larger (and thus heavier) EV models, such as SUVs and trucks, being made widely available in the coming years, coupled with an increased number of EV fleets, will require a greater number of easily accessible charging outlets. Further, DC charging is expected to grow faster than the overall charging market as EV range increases, battery density grows and as EV driver demographics and EV use cases expand. Access to convenient and affordable charging is key to accelerating EV adoption and EVgo’s mix of public and dedicated high-powered DCFC and low-powered Level 2 offerings positions EVgo to take advantage of broadening electrification trends.
EVgo is differentiated as an operator of charging infrastructure focused on high traffic, high density urban, suburban and exurban areas. EVgo has an extensive track record in optimized site selection, site development, planning, equipment procurement, engineering, construction and operation. In addition, EVgo’s robust underwriting standards underpin disciplined capital allocation. Experience as an asset owner and operator also provides the essential ingredients for being a partner of first resort in provision of white label services, creating increased optionality to provide charging services to emerging segments.
The EVgo team has an extensive skillset and expertise in network planning, site selection, site development, permitting and engineering, equipment specification and procurement, site construction and commissioning, as well as operations, maintenance and networking of a distributed network of DCFCs across the country. 
The core elements of this ongoing strategy include:

● | Identifying Optimal Charging Sites. EVgo has developed a proprietary set of tools that leverage sophisticated data science, financial modeling and geographic information system (“GIS”) techniques to design the Company’s network plan. The tools inform allocations and charger placement at both macro and micro geographical levels – nationally, within a Metropolitan Division, within a specific utility territory and down to specific site locations. The tool takes into account current and projected EV penetration trends, local availability of charging infrastructure, traffic patterns, fleet partner electrification, input from OEMs, environmental justice and government policies. Based on these inputs, the tools optimize for financial return, regulatory incentive capture,

utilization and network coverage. EVgo’s network plan serves to organize the activities and priorities of the internal and external parties involved in deploying the network, allowing EVgo to quickly execute against national opportunities like the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (“NEVI”) Program, which was established by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, while being efficient with its resources.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Charging Sites Development, Engineering and Construction. EVgo has teams of professionals with site leasing expertise who have long-standing relationships with national and regional retail chains and real estate investment trusts. These teams are focused on securing rights for charging station construction and operation at optimal sites that fit into a national network plan. In addition, EVgo has Development Engineering and Project Engineering teams that design site-specific solutions and bid construction projects out to third party engineering, procurement and construction firms. A Hardware Engineering team specifies, qualifies, tests, and validates all charging equipment that is deployed to ensure a seamless experience for EVgo customers. EVgo Project Management and Grid Integration teams then oversee construction projects, secure permits and easements as needed, and help ensure high quality and safety of charging sites. The Network Operations team commissions the sites and adds them to the active network.

● | Charging Equipment Procurement. The EVgo Supply Chain team secures availability of all equipment, negotiates pricing, maintains forecasts, and manages logistics and warehousing to ensure that the construction of sites can be carried out in a timely and cost-effective manner. The Supply Chain team negotiates manufacturing and services agreements with all suppliers, conducts quarterly and annual business reviews with them, and audits conformance with the terms of EVgo’s agreements. Detailed quality control metrics are measured and reported during these meetings, along with improvement plans as needed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Charging Sites Operation. EVgo’s Network Operations Center (“NOC”) operates from redundant locations on a 24/7/365 basis to remotely monitor all sites and charging stations. In addition to staffing internal resources, EVgo contracts with several national network maintenance firms to ensure response times in as little as four hours when needed. EVgo carries out predictive and preventive maintenance designed to avoid interruption of service, and also corrective maintenance in cases where equipment requires attention. The NOC team also performs regular onsite health checks to ensure that equipment is operating correctly and that any cosmetic issues are resolved. The EVgo Customer Care Center also operates from redundant locations on a 24/7/365 basis and is available to help customers resolve issues that they may encounter. In 2022, EVgo launched the ReNew program with six key pillars of execution — prevention, diagnostics, rapid response, analysis, resilience, and continuous customer service — to further enhance its operating practices. As part of the program, EVgo plans to replace, upgrade or remove aging chargers to improve network reliability. Leveraging years of operational data, EVgo anticipates the needs of transportation electrification to improve operational effectiveness.

Competition
The charging infrastructure sector is evolving as the EV market grows and expands to serve new drivers, and it is likely to become increasingly competitive. Key parts of the charging value chain include charging equipment manufacturing and sales, charging network operation and ownership and charging software development. The EV charging companies currently operating in the U.S. – like Blink, ChargePoint, Electrify America, Tesla, Shell Recharge Solutions (formerly Greenlots), Volta, Tritium, IoTecha, Rhombus and a few electric utilities – are involved with various parts of this value chain. But given the relatively early stage of electrification as a sector, the business models being pursued by each company are still in flux. In general, charging sector incumbents may expand their product offerings and sales strategies and new well-capitalized competitors may enter the market. 
As the charging sector continues to evolve, a number of players have emerged or could emerge as competitors of EVgo. As a leading builder, owner and operator of a public fast charging network, EVgo’s competitors include Electrify America, Blink, ChargePoint, Shell Recharge Solutions (formerly Greenlots), Volta, Tesla, Tritium, IoTecha, Rhombus, BP, Voltera, TerraWatt and Flo as well as the limited number of utilities granted permission by their regulators to own charging assets. As a provider of integrated fleet solutions, EVgo’s competitors include Electrify America, Blink, ChargePoint, Shell Recharge Solutions, Volta, Tritium, IoTecha, Rhombus, BP, Voltera, TerraWatt and Flo, but utilities could emerge as a competitive force in the future, as well as other pure play charging companies aiming to capitalize on the fleet electrification trend.
The principal competitive factors in the industry include charger count, locations, accessibility and quality of the customer experience; DCFC network availability and reliability, scale and local density; charger connectivity to EVs and ability to charge all standards; speed of charging relative to expected vehicle dwell times at the location; software-enabled services; operator brand, track record and reputation; access to equipment vendors and service providers; access to public policy support and pricing; and access to capital to support network expansion.
Barriers to entry in the EV charging market may erode as a result of government intervention and various support programs, leading to more competitors with a variety of profitability objectives. EVgo has competitive advantages in delivering charging services driven by network scale, network design, experience developing and operating DCFC infrastructure, OEM partnerships, fleet and rideshare partnerships, brand equity, longstanding reputation in the industry, a well-established supply chain, differentiated station design and software enabled service offerings and network effects 

16



driven by a large number of repeat customers. Competition arising from use of other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid EVs and high fuel economy gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles could inhibit growth in the EV sector.
Suppliers and Service Providers
Charging Equipment and Related Services
EVgo relies on third-party vendors for design, testing and manufacturing of charging equipment. At this stage of the industry, equipment is unique to each supplier with respect to components and aftermarket maintenance and warranty services. As such, equipment and services are currently singularly sourced from each supplier. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Delta and Graybar Electric provided 81.9% of EVgo’s total charging equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Delta and Marubeni (as a representative of SK-Signet) provided 37.3% of EVgo’s total charging equipment.
EVgo has invested in and maintains long-term relationships with suppliers and service providers. EVgo designs stations and specifies EV chargers in-house and outsources production to an assortment of manufacturers. Based on a rigorous certification and qualification testing process, the Company has established commercial relationships with multiple EV charger manufacturers including SK-Signet, Delta, BTC, ABB, IoTecha and LiteOn. EVgo typically appoints and manages specialized electrical and civil contractors to perform station construction and maintenance activities. Additionally, EVgo’s charger management software platform was developed and is operated by Driivz.
Electricity
During 2022, electricity was purchased for charging stations directly from local utilities as a commercial and industrial customer for approximately 64% of EVgo’s charging sites, with these sites representing approximately 76% of total GWh throughput. Each site qualifies for a certain utility tariff based primarily on maximum instantaneous electric usage measured over a historic period. A typical electricity tariff for a site consists of (i) a fixed charge, generally based on the number of meters on site, (ii) an energy charge based on kWh used, which may vary depending on time of use (including seasons and peak hours), (iii) a demand charge, or cost charged per kW during the applicable calculation period, which is often monthly, but which may also vary depending on time of use and (iv) any applicable state and utility taxes. The remainder of EVgo’s charging sites obtain electricity through the Site Host. EVgo reimburses the Site Host for the cost of the electricity at a pre-negotiated rate, subject to the terms of each Site Host agreement. The negotiated rate varies based on the Site Host’s electricity tariff, the size of the charging site and other financial incentives provided to the Site Host.
Customers, Partnerships and Strategic Relationships
EVgo has established partnerships and strategic relationships with key OEMs, including GM, Nissan, and Toyota, Site Hosts and fleet operators, as discussed further below. These relationships allow EVgo to access new customers and build brand awareness through co-marketing. EVgo may also benefit from promotional programs sponsored by OEMs. In some cases, OEM partners have agreed to provide one-time or ongoing payments related to the build-out of EVgo’s charger network. In all cases, EVgo retains 100% ownership of the chargers built under these OEM programs.
EVgo has established, invested in and maintained long-term relationships with Site Hosts with national and regional multi-site portfolios of commercial and retail properties. EVgo’s Site Hosts span a wide array of industries and locations, including airports, automobile dealers, healthcare/medical facilities, hotels, mixed-use facilities, municipal locations, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs and workplace locations. EVgo executes numerous master agreements with Site Hosts that enable the conversion of prospect sites into develop-able locations by standardizing terms and conditions for site control. EVgo’s ownership model is attractive to Site Host partners as it allows them to offer an EV charging amenity to their customers without needing to incur upfront capital expenditures or ongoing operating costs while generating rent revenue from EVgo. The benefits offered to Site Hosts through EVgo’s business model continue to provide EVgo access to the highest quality property owners, grocery store chains, parking garages, airports and convenience stores.
The Company had one customer that comprised 19.7% of the Company’s total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022. The Company had two customers that comprised 32.4% of the Company’s total accounts receivable as of 

17



December 31, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, two customers represented 42.9% and one customer represented 10.5% of total revenue, respectively. As EVgo and the EV industry continue to grow, EVgo expects revenues will be generated from a larger and an increasingly diverse group of customers and commercial partners. In the ordinary course of business, EVgo engages in active discussions and renegotiations with EVgo’s commercial partners with respect to the solutions it provides and the terms of its agreements, including fees. Most of EVgo’s contracts with EVgo’s commercial partners have multi-year terms and some have rights to terminate prior to the end of the term. The loss of any of EVgo’s largest commercial partners or the renegotiation of any of EVgo’s largest contracts with its commercial partners could adversely affect EVgo’s results of operations.

General Motors
On July 20, 2020, EVgo entered into a five-year contract with GM (the “GM Agreement”) to build 2,750 fast charger stalls that EVgo owns and operates as part of the Company’s public network. The GM Agreement has been amended twice to expand the overall number of charger stalls to be installed to 3,250, adjust charger stall installation targets, extend the completion deadline to March 31, 2026, and provide for a payment of $7,000,000 in December 2022 in exchange for EVgo’s agreement to apply certain branding decals on the fast chargers funded by GM pursuant to the GM Agreement and maintain a specified uptime percentage (described below) over the term of the agreement. EVgo believes the GM Agreement will serve to accelerate the Company’s development plans and enhance customer acquisition and brand equity among retail drivers. Pursuant to the GM Agreement, EVgo is required to meet certain quarterly milestones measured by the number of charger stalls installed, and GM is required to make certain payments based on charger stalls installed. 
Under the GM Agreement, EVgo is required to install a total of 3,250 charger stalls by March 31, 2026, 44% of which are required to be installed by December 31, 2023. Meeting these milestones will require additional funds beyond the amounts committed by GM, and EVgo may face delays in construction, commissioning or certain aspects of installation of the charger stalls the Company is obligated to develop. EVgo is also required to maintain network availability (i.e., the percentage of time a charger is operational and available on the network) of at least 95%. In addition to the capital build program, EVgo is required to provide GM EV customers with reservations and certain EVgo services at a discounted rate and branding on chargers.
The GM Agreement is subject to early termination in certain circumstances, including in the event EVgo fails to meet the quarterly charger stall-installation milestones or maintain the specified level of network availability. If GM opts to terminate the agreement, EVgo may not be entitled to receive continued payments from GM and instead may be required to pay liquidated damages to GM. In the event EVgo fails to meet a charger stall-installation milestone or maintain the required network availability in a calendar quarter, GM has the right to provide EVgo with a notice of such deficiency within 30 days of the end of the quarter. If the same deficiency still exists at the end of the quarter immediately following the quarter for which a deficiency notification was delivered, GM may immediately terminate the agreement and seek pre-agreed liquidated damages of up to $15.0 million.
Nissan
EVgo has executed two agreements with Nissan North America, Inc. (“Nissan”) under which EVgo has provided charger construction and installation and certain other services. Pursuant to the first agreement (the “Nissan 1.0 Agreement”), the Company was required to support, maintain and make available at least 850 chargers through July 2021, and purchasers or lessees of Nissan LEAF EVs in certain markets could receive charging services at EVgo stations or participating third-party charging stations. The Company fulfilled all build, support and maintenance obligations under the Nissan 1.0 Agreement.
The second agreement between EVgo and Nissan, entered into in June 2019 (the “Nissan 2.0 Agreement”), provides for joint marketing activities, charging credit programs for purchasers or lessees of Nissan EVs, and a capital-build program. The Nissan 2.0 Agreement has been amended several times, including most recently in the fourth quarter of 2022 (the “Nissan Amendment”) to, among other things, adjust the allocation of the value of unused charging credits and to provide new offerings for purchasers or lessees of certain Nissan EV models. Under the joint-marketing activities provisions of the Nissan 2.0 Agreement, EVgo is obligated to spend a specified amount annually on joint-marketing activities that are mutually agreed-upon with Nissan. Under the charging credit program provisions in the Nissan 2.0 Agreement, credits for charging are allocated to purchasers or lessees of Nissan EVs, and such purchasers or lessees are 

18



permitted to charge their EV for 12 months at no charge to the participant, up to the amount of the charging credit allocated to such participant or on an unlimited basis, depending on the model of Nissan EV purchased or leased. In the event a participant does not use the entire amount of the allocated charging credit or if the annual charging credit pool is not exhausted within a specific period, a portion of the remaining dollar value of such credit rolls over to subsequent periods, and a portion is retained by the Company. For Nissan EV purchasers or lessees receiving unlimited charging, the Company receives an upfront activation fee for each purchaser or lessee as well as a usage-based fee. The capital-build program provided for in the Nissan 2.0 Agreement requires the Company to install, operate and maintain public, high-power dual-standard chargers in specified markets pursuant to a schedule that outlines the build timelines for the chargers to be constructed (the “Build Schedule”). If the Company fails to meet its Build Schedule obligations, Nissan may invoke a penalty of up to $70,000 per delayed site beyond a designated cure period, which could result in an adjustment to the consideration received by the Company under the Nissan 2.0 Agreement. EVgo and Nissan previously agreed to amend the Nissan 2.0 Agreement to extend the installation deadlines under the Build Schedule by up to 12 months, and Nissan has waived penalties for installation delays relating to program year one. 
EVgo’s ability to meet its Build Schedule obligations may be impacted by delays in permitting, commissioning and utility interconnection, supply chain disruptions impacting business operations across the utility, engineering and permitting chain, including due to impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; as well as delays related to industry and regulatory adaptation to the requirements of high-powered charger installation, including slower than expected third-party approvals by utilities and landowners of sites where charger stations will be located. 
The Pilot Company
On July 5, 2022, EVgo entered into a charging infrastructure agreement (the “Pilot Infrastructure Agreement”) and an operations and maintenance agreement (the “Pilot O&M”) with Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot Company”) and GM to build, operate and maintain up to 2,000 stalls served by DC chargers that Pilot Company will own. The stalls will be located at approximately 500 Pilot Company sites across more than 40 states.
Pursuant to the Pilot Infrastructure Agreement, EVgo is required to meet certain construction milestones measured by the number of sites commissioned and Pilot Company is required to make certain payments each month based on completion of pre-engineering and development work, the progress of construction at each site and for each charger procured by EVgo. Subject to extensions of time for specified excusable events, if EVgo is unable to meet its commissioning obligations, Pilot Company will be entitled to liquidated damages calculated per day, subject to a cap of $30,000 at each site. The Pilot Infrastructure Agreement contains various provisions that may permit or cause early termination, including Pilot’s right to terminate after 1,000 stalls have been completed, the inability of EVgo to secure certain chargers and a material increase in the price of chargers due to a change in law. If Pilot Company elects to terminate the Pilot Infrastructure Agreement after 1,000 stalls have been completed, Pilot Company must pay EVgo a termination fee per stall for those not built; such fee varies based on the number of stalls already built.
Under the Pilot O&M, EVgo is required to perform operations, maintenance and networking services on stalls built and commissioned under the Pilot Infrastructure Agreement in exchange for payment of a monthly fee by Pilot to EVgo. EVgo is subject to certain performance criteria under the Pilot O&M.

Intellectual Property
EVgo protects its intellectual property and proprietary rights through patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws, and by confidentiality protocols. EVgo undertakes actions as it deems necessary to ensure that its proprietary rights are protected, while at the same time respecting the intellectual property rights of other persons.
As of December 31, 2022, EVgo held 16 patents and had 15 additional patent applications pending in the U.S. and abroad. EVgo continues to regularly assess opportunities for seeking patent protection for those aspects of EVgo’s technology, designs and methodologies that provide a meaningful competitive advantage to the Company.

Governmental Regulation
State, regional and local regulations for installing EV charging stations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may include permitting requirements, inspection requirements, licensing of contractors and certifications.
On December 16, 2019, the California Department of Food and Agriculture’s Division of Measurement Standards adopted amendments that, among other specifications, require EVSE transactions to be measured in either kilowatt hours (kWh) or megajoules. This regulation prohibits per-minute billing for AC chargers installed on or after January 1, 2021, and DC chargers installed on or after January 1, 2023. AC chargers installed before 2021 are not subject to the regulations until 2031, and DC chargers installed prior to 2023 are not subject to the regulations until 2033. EVgo has been transitioning to kWh pricing across its portfolio of public chargers, beginning with California in 2021.
Generally, public utilities commissions and state legislatures across the country have determined that EV charging service providers will not be regulated as utilities. While exceptions still exist and individual state determinations are not binding on any other regulator or jurisdiction, they demonstrate a trend in the way states view the EV charging industry. Other jurisdictions are exploring similar reforms. The determination not to regulate the Company as a utility generally provides the Company with greater flexibility to set rates and frees the Company from being subject to more burdensome regulatory requirements.

Grants and Incentives
EVgo continuously pursues public grants, subsidies and incentives to reduce capital expenditures. EVgo has dedicated and plans to continue to dedicate a variety of internal and external resources to monitor, submit for and utilize available grant, subsidy and incentive funding for the development of DCFCs on a state, local and national level. EVgo’s network expansion and local build plans are generally informed based on expected timing for and availability of funding of this type. EVgo has received grants from the California Energy Commission, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Colorado Energy Office, Maryland Energy Administration, North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, among others. As noted above, IIJA included $5 billion in formula funds for state departments of transportation to award EV charging infrastructure projects and EVgo expects these funds to have significant impacts on the EV charging landscape over the coming years.
EVgo has historically benefitted from the availability of federal tax credits under Section 30C of the Code, which effectively subsidizes the cost of placing in service EVgo’s charging stations. The Inflation Reduction Act revised the credit under Section 30C to extend the credit until December 31, 2032, introduce the concept of transferability of such tax credits, expand the credit such that it is capped at $100,000 per item and increase eligibility requirements to require installation of EV charging stations in certain census tracts along with meeting prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, among other changes. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors — The EV market currently benefits from the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives from governments, utilities and others to offset the purchase or operating cost of EVs and EV charging stations. The reduction, modification or elimination of such benefits could adversely affect EVgo’s financial results.” for further discussion.
EVgo intends to continue to vigorously seek additional grants, rebates, subsidies and incentives as an effective avenue to reduce its capital investment in the promotion, purchase and installation of charging stations where applicable.

Government Regulations to Enhance EV Adoption
The regulations mandated by the National Highway Transit Safety Administration (“NHTSA’s”) Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards set the average new vehicle fuel economy, as weighted by sales, that a manufacturer’s fleet must achieve. These standards have been established through Model Year 2026 for light-duty vehicles; however, in September 2021, the Biden Administration proposed to significantly increase these standards for model years 2024-2026 and EVgo expects the administration to set standards for future model years as well. Although EVgo is not a car manufacturer and thus not directly subject to the CAFE standards, such standards may still indirectly affect EVgo’s business. The adoption of more stringent federal standards may create further incentives for vehicle manufacturers to increase their EV offerings, which would likely result in increased demand for charging services. Additionally, several 

20



states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington D.C., have adopted or are considering adopting bans on the sale of ICE vehicles by 2035.

Waste Handling and Disposal
EVgo is subject to laws and regulations regarding the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and solid wastes, including electronic wastes and batteries. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the superfund law, in the U.S. and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred as well as companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur.
The Company may also generate or dispose of solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain components of EVgo’s charging stations may be excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations, provided certain requirements are met. However, if these components do not meet all of the established requirements for the exclusion, or if the requirements for the exclusion change, the Company may be required to treat such products as hazardous waste, which are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any such changes in the laws and regulations, or in EVgo’s ability to qualify the materials the Company uses for exclusions under such laws and regulations, could adversely affect EVgo’s operating expenses.

Renewable Energy Markets
As part of EVgo’s business strategy, the Company markets the electricity provided from EVgo’s charging stations as 100% renewable. Any claims EVgo makes to consumers about EVgo’s use of renewable energy are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). The FTC Green Guides require all non-renewable energy use to be matched with RECs in order to make renewable energy claims and may also require certain statements regarding the sources of renewable energy and related RECs. Failure to comply with such regulations can result in substantial monetary penalties or otherwise impact EVgo’s results of operations. Therefore, the Company purchases certified RECs in order to qualify the electricity the Company distributes through charging stations as renewable energy and will continue to purchase certified RECs in the future to substantiate claims that EVgo’s charging stations are powered by 100% renewable energy.
Additionally, as part of EVgo’s business model, the Company projects the number of RECs needed and purchases such RECs to meet this projection. Failure to accurately project EVgo’s REC needs may result in the purchasing of RECs on the spot market in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations. If material, this may adversely affect EVgo’s business and financial condition.

LCFS Credits
As a charging station owner and operator, EVgo earns regulatory credits, such as Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) credits and other regulatory credits, in states where such programs are enacted currently, including the Fast Charging Infrastructure Program in California. These credits are generated through charging station operations based on the volume of kWh sold. EVgo earns additional revenue through the sale of these credits to buyers obligated to purchase the credits to comply with the program mandates. EVgo actively seeks to maximize the number of credits generated per kWh of energy sold by sourcing renewable electricity. In addition to current programs, EVgo is currently monitoring implementation of Washington’s program and additional proposals in varying stages of discussions, including in New York, along with 

21



potential changes to the Renewable Fuels Standard. The availability of such credits depends on continued governmental support for these programs and regulatory frameworks that make it possible for EVgo to participate in these credit markets.
Human Capital Management
EVgo believes that its people are its most important asset. The Company is focused on fostering a diverse workforce with different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds to encourage innovative and creative ideas, and ultimately lead to collective success. 
EVgo’s workforce is essential in delivering on its business objectives. Its human capital management strategy is integrated with the overall leadership objectives (including ESG) and is designed to attract, develop, and retain a high performing workforce and evolve the Company’s culture to sustain its business, both today and in the future. EVgo is focused on maintaining a culture of inclusion and operational excellence that supports its employees, customers, and the many diverse communities it serves. The workforce is guided by its core commitments of safety, integrity, diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”), customer service and continuous improvement. 
EVgo remains steadfast in its commitment to treating people with dignity and respect. The Company is focused on maintaining the high standards of ethical conduct on which its business and reputation have been built. 
As of March 1, 2023, EVgo had 295 employees, including 292 regular full-time employees. None of EVgo’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage and believes in maintaining positive relationships with EVgo’s employees. 
The following charts present EVgo’s total employee population indicating percentages of employees that are female or are racially and/or ethnically diverse as of March 1, 2023: 

Health and Safety. EVgo is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the communities it serves. The Company’s commitment is demonstrated by providing the tools and skill building needed to help ensure that employees can perform their work safely. Employees are empowered and encouraged to question, stop, and correct any unsafe act or condition while communicating openly and honestly on health and safety issues. 

22



Culture and DEI. EVgo recognizes that racism, sexism, ableism, classism, ageism, and discrimination exist. The Company’s vision is “Electric for All.” To uphold its vision, EVgo commits to reflecting the communities it serves, upholding racial and climate justice, and eliminating environmental practices that affect communities of color. 
If EVgo aspires to achieve “Electric for All,” it needs to acknowledge the inequality of lived experiences. To be Black or Brown or a woman or disabled or LGBTQ+ or of different ages and classes is not a barrier; institutional racism, sexism, and prejudice are barriers. The Company does not tolerate a status quo that so many members of the community find painful and wants to be better. EVgo knows it will be an ongoing process and that it is important to be not just “non-discriminatory,” but also “anti-discriminatory.” The Company strives to embody – and continues to embody – a level of inclusivity that makes its staff proud. “Electric for All” stands for more than just a slogan. EVgo seeks to find ways to uphold it with action. 
EVgo is committed to hiring – and continuing to hire – Black, Indigenous, People of Color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, women, and people with different physical abilities, ages, and social classes to all levels of leadership. The Company uses terms like BIPOC and LGBTQ+, acknowledging their limitations in conveying the multitudes of identity. As language and social beliefs evolve, EVgo commits to evolving with them and mentoring and promoting people within its community whom EVgo values for their hard work, intelligence, and agility in pursuit of its mission. EVgo commits to building a portfolio of vendors that includes minority-owned businesses and to creating initiatives that ensure its employees are seen, heard, and valued. EVgo commits to continue checking in with leadership and employees to see how the Company is doing. And most importantly, commits to listening with openness. As EVgo aims to rapidly grow as a business, it commits to growing as a community as well.
The Company’s success depends on a diverse staff and inclusive leadership. EVgo believes the only way to achieve its vision of “Electric for All” is to utilize the strength that comes from the richness of diversity. Leading the vision of “Electric for All,” it commits to building and empowering a workplace community that values its members for simply being who they are. 
EVgo has created three DEI task forces that generally meet on a regular basis: 

● | Communication, Inclusion & Training: To help establish a supportive and welcoming workplace environment in which employees of all backgrounds and demographic characteristics can work together. Deliverables have included: monthly heritage information sessions, Driving Diversity newsletter, and “Overcoming Racism” training for all EVgo employees.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Talent Attraction and Development: In 2022, EVgo instituted its inaugural summer internship program providing opportunities to 12 interns of diverse backgrounds.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Electric for All and Community Engagement: To engage within communities to accelerate access to electrified transportation and to coordinate opportunities for EVgo staff to give back in their communities. EVgo is committed to doing better in its own organization and on the ground to bring more equitable access to EVs to communities across the U.S. Beyond including equity in its siting decisions, EVgo has led, partnered with and participated in several programs to promote equal access to EV charging including: EVgo Equal Access Charging Hub (“EACH”), Green Raiteros, Grid Alternatives and Veloz. EVgo aims to give back to the communities where its employees live, work and operate by participating in local and national causes, and believes that this commitment helps in the Company’s efforts to attract and retain employees. EVgo’s employees serve as the ambassadors of its social responsibility values. Deliverables have included: partnership with Boys & Girls Club of Santa Monica and Grid Alternatives solar build to deliver equitable access to charging in disproportionately impacted communities.

Talent, Attraction, Development and Engagement. From EVgo’s frontline employees to its leadership roles, the Company has maintained a focus on attracting, developing and retaining a robust talent pipeline to remain competitive and to continue to provide its customers with the highest standard of service. 
EVgo’s employees grow through a variety of training and development opportunities at all career tracks within the organization. In July 2022, the Company hosted its first EVgo University event covering in depth facets of its business – 

23



everything from how it builds chargers that customers love to creating the winning charging ecosystem through new products and applying empathy, collaboration, and ownership to get results. EVgo also offers tuition reimbursement programs to its employees. 
COVID-19 Response for EVgo’s Employees. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, EVgo has modified its business practices and currently allows most personnel to work in a hybrid manner between their home or an office location. EVgo has implemented various safety protocols for employees who must leave their homes for work such as requiring certifications of health status as well as implementing a vaccine mandate policy where all employees must present proof of vaccination. The Company provides COVID-19 related paid time off for employees to take care of themselves and their family members to get vaccinated, recover from side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine, to navigate school and daycare closures and for bereavement. EVgo may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that it determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners. 
Compensation and Benefits Program. EVgo’s compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support the Company’s business objectives, assist in the achievement of its strategic goals and create long-term value for its stockholders. The Company provides employees with compensation packages that include base salary, annual incentive bonuses tied to objectives and key results, and, for all employees, long-term equity awards tied to time-based vesting conditions. EVgo believes that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests, including by incentivizing business and individual performance (pay for performance), motivating based on long-term performance and integrating compensation with its business plans. EVgo participates in a compensation benchmark survey to review the competitiveness of its compensation packages. In addition, the Company offers employees benefits such as life and health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, uncapped paid time off, paid parental leave and a 401(k) plan.
