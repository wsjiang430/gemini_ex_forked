ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
General
 
We are currently engaged in the recycling energy business, providing energy savings and recycling products and services. We are a leading developer of waste energy recycling projects for industrial applications in China, and we believe that we are the only developer to use a Build-Operate-Transfer (“BOT”) model to provide energy saving and recovery facilities for multiple energy intensive industries in China. Our waste energy recycling projects allow customers who use substantial amounts of electricity to recapture previously wasted pressure, heat, and gas from their manufacturing processes to generate electricity. We currently offer waste energy recycling systems to companies for use in iron and steel, nonferrous metal, cement, coal and petrochemical plants. We construct our projects at our customer’s facility and the electricity produced is used on-site by the customer. While some of our competitors offer projects targeting one or two verticals, we serve multiple verticals.
 
We develop fully customized projects across several verticals to better meet customer’s energy recovery needs. Our waste pressure-to-energy solution primarily consists of the Blast Furnace Top Gas Recovery Turbine Unit (“TRT”), a system that utilizes high pressure gas emitted from the blast furnace top to drive turbine units and generate electricity. Our waste heat-to-energy solution primarily consists of heat power generation projects for applications in cement, steel, coking coal, and nonferrous metal industries, which collect the residual heat from various manufacturing processes, e.g. the entrance and exit ends of the cement rotary kilns, to generate electricity. Our waste gas-to-energy solution primarily consists of the Waste Gas Power Generation system (“WGPG”) and the Combined Cycle Power Plant (the “CCPP”). A WGPG system utilizes flammable waste gas from coal mining, petroleum exploitation, refinery processing or other sources as a fuel source to generate electricity through the use of a gas turbine. A CCPP system employs more than one power generating cycle to utilize the waste gas, which not only generates electricity by burning the flammable waste gas in a gas turbine (as a WGPG) but also uses the waste heat from burning the gas to make steam to generate additional electricity via a steam turbine.
 
We provide a clean-technology and energy-efficient solution aimed at reducing the air pollution and energy shortage problems in China. Our projects capture industrial waste energy to produce low-cost electricity, enabling industrial manufacturers to reduce their energy costs, lower their operating costs, and extend the life of primary manufacturing equipment. In addition, our waste energy recycling projects allow our industrial customers to reduce their reliance on China’s centralized national power grid, which is prone to black-outs or brown-outs or is completely inaccessible from certain remote areas. Our projects generally produce lower carbon dioxide emissions and other pollutants, and are hence more environmentally friendly than other forms of power generation.
 
Since 2007, we have primarily used the “Build-Operate-Transfer” (“BOT”) model to serve our customers. For each project, we design, finance, construct and install the waste energy recycling projects for our customers, operate the projects for five to twenty years, and then transfer the projects to the owners. The BOT model creates a win-win solution for both our customers and us. We provide the capital expenditure financing in exchange for attractive returns on each project; our customers can focus their capital resources on their core businesses, do not need to invest additional capitals to comply with government environmental regulations, reduce noise and emissions and reduce their energy costs. We in turn efficiently recapture our costs through the stream of lease payments.

The Company was incorporated on May 8, 1980 as Boulder Brewing Company under the laws of the State of Colorado. On September 6, 2001, the Company changed its state of incorporation to the State of Nevada. In 2004, the Company changed its name from Boulder Brewing Company to China Digital Wireless, Inc. and on March 8, 2007, again changed its name from China Digital Wireless, Inc. to its current name, China Recycling Energy Corporation. The Company, through its subsidiaries, provides energy saving solutions and services, including selling and leasing energy saving systems and equipment to customers, project investment, investment management, economic information consulting, technical services, financial leasing, purchase of financial leasing assets, disposal and repair of financial leasing assets, consulting and ensuring of financial leasing transactions in the Peoples Republic of China (“PRC”).
 
Our business is primarily conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Shanghai Yinghua Financial Leasing Co., Ltd. (“Yinghua”) and Sifang Holdings Co., Ltd. (“Sifeng”), Sifeng’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Huahong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (“Huahong”) and Shanghai TCH, Shanghai TCH’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Xi’an TCH Energy Technology Company, Ltd. (“Xi’an TCH”), Xi’an TCH’s wholly-owned subsidiary Erdos TCH Energy Saving Development Co., Ltd. (“Erdos TCH”) and Xi’an TCH’s 90% owned subsidiary Xi’an Zhonghong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and Zhongxun Energy Investment (Beijing) Co., Ltd (“Zhongxun”). Shanghai TCH was established as a foreign investment enterprise in Shanghai under the laws of the PRC on May 25, 2004, and currently has registered capital of $29.80 million. Xi’an TCH was incorporated in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province under the laws of the PRC in November 2007. Erdos TCH was incorporated in April 2009. Huahong was incorporated in February 2009. Xi’an Zhonghong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. was incorporated in July 2013. Xi’an TCH paid RMB 27 million ($4.37 million) and owns 90% of Zhonghong. Zhonghong provides energy saving solutions and services, including constructing, selling and leasing energy saving systems and equipment to customers. Zhongxun was incorporated in March 2014, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xi’an TCH.
 
Our Projects
 
We design, finance, construct, operate and eventually transfer waste energy recycling projects to meet the energy saving and recovery needs of our customers. Our waste energy recycling projects use the pressure, heat or gas, which is generated as a byproduct of a variety of industrial processes, to create electricity. The residual energy from industrial processes, which was traditionally wasted, may be captured in a recovery process and utilized by our waste energy recycling projects to generate electricity burning additional fuel and additional emissions. Among a wide variety of waste-to-energy technologies and solutions, we primarily focus on waste pressure to energy systems, waste heat to energy systems and waste gas power generation systems. We do not manufacture the equipment and materials that are used in the construction of our waste energy recycling projects. Rather, we incorporate standard power generating equipment into a fully integrated onsite project for our customers.
Waste Pressure to Energy Systems
 
TRT is a power generating system utilizing the exhaust pressure and heat from industrial processes in the iron, steel, petrochemical, chemical and non-ferrous metals industries, often from blast furnace gases in the metal production industries. Without TRT power systems, blast furnace gas is treated by various de-pressurizing valves to decrease its pressure and temperature before the gas is transmitted to end users. No electricity is generated during the process and noise and heat pollution is released. In a TRT system, the blast furnace gas produced during the smelting process is directed through the system to decrease its pressure and temperature. The released pressure and heat is then utilized to drive the turbine unit to generate electricity, which is then transmitted back to the producer. We believe our projects are superior to those of our competitors due to the inclusion of advanced dry-type de-dusting technology, joined turbine systems, and automatic power grid synchronization.

Waste Heat to Energy Systems
 
Waste heat to energy systems utilize waste heat generated in industrial production to generate electricity. The waste heat is trapped to heat a boiler to create steam and power a steam turbine. Our waste heat to energy systems have used waste heat from cement production and from metal production. We invested and have built two cement low temperature heat power generation systems. These projects can use about 35% of the waste heat generated by the cement kiln, and generate up to 50% of the electricity needed to operate the cement plant.
Waste Gas to Energy Systems
 
Our Waste Gas to Energy Systems primarily include Waste Gas Power Generation (“WGPG”) systems and Combined Cycle Power Plant (“CCPP”) systems. WGPG uses the flammable waste gases emitted from industrial production processes such as blast furnace gas, coke furnace gas, and oil gas, to power gas-fired generators to create energy. A CCPP system employs more than one power generating cycle to utilize the waste gas, which is more efficient because it not only generates electricity by burning the flammable waste gas in a gas-fired generator (WGPG) but also uses the waste heat from burning the gas to make steam to generate additional electricity via a steam generator (CCPP).
 
Shanghai TCH and its Subsidiaries
 
Shanghai TCH was established as a foreign investment enterprise in Shanghai under the laws of the PRC on May 25, 2004 and has a registered capital of $29.80 million. Xi’an TCH was incorporated in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province under the laws of the PRC on November 8, 2007. In February 2009, Huahong was incorporated in Xi’an, Shaanxi province. Erdos TCH was incorporated in April 2009 in Erdos, Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region. On July 19, 2013, Xi’an TCH formed a new company called Xi’an Zhonghong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd (“Zhonghong”). Xi’an TCH owns 90% of Zhonghong, which provides energy saving solutions and services, including constructing, selling and leasing energy saving systems and equipment to customers. On March 24, 2014, Xi’an TCH incorporated a new subsidiary, Zhongxun Energy Investment (Beijing) Co., Ltd (“Zhongxun”) with registered capital of $5,695,502 (RMB 35,000,000). Zhongxun is 100% owned by Xi’an TCH and is mainly engaged in project investment, investment management, economic information consulting, and technical services. Zhongxun has not yet commenced operations as of the date of this report.
 
As of December 31, 2017, Xi’an TCH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shanghai TCH, was leasing the following systems: (i) BMPG systems to Pucheng Phase I and II (15 and 11.9 year terms, respectively); (ii) BMPG systems to Shenqiu Phase I (11 year term); and (iii) Shenqiu Phase II (9.5 year term). In addition, as of December 31, 2017, Erdos TCH leased power and steam generating systems from waste heat from metal refining to Erdos (five systems) for a term of twenty (20) years.
 
Erdos TCH – Joint Venture
 
On April 14, 2009, the Company formed Erdos TCH as a joint venture (the “JV” or “Erdos TCH”) with Erdos Metallurgy Co., Ltd. (“Erdos”) to recycle waste heat from Erdos’ metal refining plants to generate power and steam to be sold back to Erdos. The JV has a term of 20 years with a total investment for the project estimated at $79 million (RMB 500 million) and an initial investment of $17.55 million (RMB 120 million). Erdos contributed 7% of the total investment for the project, and Xi’an TCH contributed 93%. According to Xi’an TCH and Erdos’ agreement on profit distribution, Xi’an TCH and Erdos will receive 80% and 20%, respectively, of the profit from the JV until Xi’an TCH receives the complete return of its investment. Xi’an TCH and Erdos will then receive 60% and 40%, respectively, of the profit from the JV. On June 15, 2013, Xi’an TCH and Erdos entered into a share transfer agreement, pursuant to which Erdos transferred and sold its 7% ownership interest in the JV to Xi’an TCH for $1.29 million (RMB 8 million), plus certain accumulated profits as described below. Xi’an TCH paid the $1.29 million in July 2013 and, as a result, became the sole stockholder of Erdos TCH. In addition, Xi’an TCH is required to pay Erdos accumulated profits from inception up to June 30, 2013 in accordance with the supplementary agreement entered on August 6, 2013. In August 2013, Xi’an TCH paid 20% of the accumulated profit (calculated under PRC GAAP) of $226,000 to Erdos. Erdos TCH currently has two power generation systems in Phase I with a total of 18 MW power capacity, and three power generation systems in Phase II with a total of 27 MW power capacity.

With the current economic conditions in China, the government has limited and reduced over capacity and production in the iron and steel industry, which has resulted in a sharp decrease of Erdos Metallurgy Co., Ltd’s production of ferrosilicon, its revenue and cash flows, and has made it difficult for Erdos to make the monthly minimum lease payment.
 
 After considering the challenging economic conditions facing Erdos, and to maintain the long-term cooperative relationship between the parties, which we believe will continue to produce long-term benefits, on April 28, 2016, Erdos TCH and Erdos entered into a supplemental agreement, effective May 1, 2016. Under the supplemental agreement, Erdos TCH cancelled monthly minimum lease payments from Erdos, and agreed to charge Erdos based on actual electricity sold at RMB 0.30 / KWH, which such price will be adjusted annually based on prevailing market conditions. The Company evaluated the modified terms for payments based on actual electricity sold as minimum lease payments as defined in ASC 840-10-25-4, since lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to the future use of the leased property are contingent rentals and, accordingly, are excluded from minimum lease payments in their entirety. The Company wrote off the net investment receivables of these leases at the lease modification date.  
 
Pucheng Biomass Power Generation Projects
 
On June 29, 2010, Xi’an TCH entered into a Biomass Power Generation (“BMPG”) Project Lease Agreement with PuchengXinHeng Yuan Biomass Power Generation Co., Ltd.

On July 24, 2013, Zhonghong entered into a Cooperative Agreement of CDQ and CDQ WHPG Project with Boxing County Chengli Gas Supply Co., Ltd. (“Chengli”). The parties entered into a supplement agreement on July 26, 2013. Pursuant to these agreements, Zhonghong agreed to design, build and maintain a 25 MW CDQ system and a CDQ WHPG system to supply power to Chengli, and Chengli agreed to pay energy saving fees (the “Chengli Project”). Chengli will contract the operation of the system to a third party contractor that is mutually agreed to by Zhonghong. In addition, Chengli will provide the land for the CDQ system and CDQ WHPG system at no cost to Zhonghong. The term of the Agreements is for 20 years. The watt hours generated by the Chengli Project will be charged at RMB 0.42 ($0.068) per KWH (excluding tax). The operating time shall be based upon an average 8,000 hours annually. If the operating time is less than 8,000 hours per year due to a reason attributable to Chengli, then time charged shall be 8,000 hours a year, and if it is less than 8,000 hours due to a reason attributable to Zhonghong, then it shall be charged at actual operating hours. The construction of the Chengli Project was completed in the second quarter of 2015 and the project successfully completed commissioning tests in the first quarter of 2017. The Chengli Project is now operational, but will not begin operations until the Company receives the required power generating license, which the Company anticipates receiving in the second quarter of 2018. When operations begin, Chengli shall ensure its coking production line works properly and that working hours for the CDQ system are at least 8,000 hours per year, and Zhonghong shall ensure that working hours for the CDQ WHPG system are at least 7,200 hours per year.
 
On July 22, 2013, Zhonghong entered into an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) General Contractor Agreement for the Boxing County Chengli Gas Supply Co., Ltd. CDQ Power Generation Project (the “Chengli Project”) with Xi’an Huaxin New Energy Co., Ltd. (“Huaxin”). Zhonghong, as the owner of the Chengli Project, contracted EPC services for a CDQ system and a 25 MW CDQ WHPG system for Chengli from Huaxin. Huaxin shall provide construction, equipment procurement, transportation, installation and adjustment, test run, construction engineering management and other necessary services to complete the Chengli Project and ensure the CDQ system and CDQ WHPG system for Chengli meet the inspection and acceptance requirements and work normally. The Chengli Project is a turn-key project in which Huaxin is responsible for monitoring the quality, safety, duration and cost of the Chengli Project. The total contract price is RMB 200 million ($33.34 million), which includes all materials, equipment, labor, transportation, electricity, water, waste disposal, machinery and safety costs.
 
Tianyu Waste Heat Power Generation Project
 
On July 19, 2013, Zhonghong entered into a Cooperative Agreement (the “Tianyu Agreement”) for Energy Management of CDQ and CDQ WHPG with Jiangsu Tianyu Energy and Chemical Group Co., Ltd (“Tianyu”). Pursuant to the Tianyu Agreement, Zhonghong will design, build, operate and maintain two sets of 25 MW CDQ and CDQ WHPG systems for two subsidiaries of Tianyu – Xuzhou Tian’an Chemical Co., Ltd (“Xuzhou Tian’an”) and Xuzhou Huayu Coking Co., Ltd. (“Xuzhou Huayu”) – to be located at Xuzhou Tian’an and Xuzhou Huayu’s respective locations (the “Tianyu Project”). Upon completion of the Tianyu Project, Zhonghong will charge Tianyu an energy saving fee of RMB 0.534 ($0.087) per KWH (excluding tax). The operating time will be based upon an average 8,000 hours annually for each of Xuzhou Tian’an and Xuzhou Huayu. If the operating time is less than 8,000 hours per year due to a reason attributable to Tianyu, then time charged will be 8,000 hours a year. Because of the control of the overcapacity and pollution of the iron and steel and related industries, the government has imposed production limitations for the energy-intensive enterprises with heavy pollution, including Xuzhou Tian’an. Xuzhou Tian’an has slowed the construction process for its dry quenching production line which caused the delay of our project. The construction of the Xuzhou Tian’an Project is anticipated to be completed by the third quarter of 2018. Xuzhou Tian’an will provide the land for the CDQ and CDQ WHPG systems for free. Xuzhou Tian’an also guarantees that it will purchase all of the power generated by the CDQ WHPG systems. The Xuzhou Huayu Project is currently on hold due to a conflict between Xuzhou Huayu Coking Co., Ltd. and local residents on certain pollution-related issues. The local government has acted in its capacity to coordinate the resolution of this issue. The local residents were requested to move from the hygienic buffer zone of the project location with compensatory payments from the government. Xuzhou Huayu was required to stop production and implement technical innovations to mitigate pollution discharge including sewage treatment, dust collection, noise control, and recycling of coal gas. Currently, some local residents have moved. Xuzhou Huayu has completed the implementation of the technical innovations of sewage treatment, dust collection, and noise control, and the Company is waiting for local governmental agencies to approve these technical innovations so that we can resume construction. We expect to complete the construction of Xuzhou Huayu in the second quarter of 2018. Once Huayu obtains the government’s acceptance and approval of the technical innovations, the project will resume.

Industry and Market Overview
 
Overview of Waste-to-Energy Industry
 
The waste energy recycling industry concentrates mostly on power-intensive manufacturing and production processes, such as iron, steel and nonferrous metal production, cement production, and coal and petrochemical plants. Our waste energy recycling projects allow customers to recapture previously wasted pressure, heat, and gas from their manufacturing and production processes and use this waste to generate electricity. Waste energy recycling projects are installed at a customer’s facility and the electricity produced can be used on-site to lower energy costs and create a more efficient production process. The industry verticals at the vanguard of this trend are metallurgical production (including iron & steel), cement, coal mining, coke production and petrochemicals.
 
The industry also includes the conversion of biomass to electricity. For thousands of years, biomass, biological material derived from living organisms like plants and their byproducts, was burned to produce heat so as to convert it to energy. A number of non-combustion methods are now available to convert raw biomass into a variety of gaseous, liquid, or solid fuels that can be used directly in a power plant to generate electricity.
 
Waste-to-Energy Industry Growth
 
China has experienced rapid economic growth and industrialization in recent years, increasing the demand for electricity. In the PRC, growth in energy consumption has exceeded growth in gross domestic product, causing a shortage of electricity with blackouts and brownouts over much of the country. Much of the energy demand has been due to the expansion of energy intensive industrial sectors such as steel, cement, and chemicals. China’s increasing modernization and industrialization has made it the world’s largest consumer of energy.
 
One result of this massive increase in electric generation capacity has been the rise of harmful emissions. China has surpassed the United States to become the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and the country faces enormous challenges from the pollution brought about by its consumption of conventional energy. On September 12, 2013, the State Council has released the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control. The action plan has proposed that in five years, China will witness the overall improvement of air quality and dramatic drop of seriously polluted days. China will strive to gradually eliminate the seriously polluted weather and notably better the national air quality in another five years or longer. Specific targets are as follows: particular matter with particle size below 10 microns (“PM10”) in cities at prefecture level or above declines by over 10% in 2017 compared with that in 2012 and premium air quality days increase year by year. The PM2.5 of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze Delta and Pearl River Delta areas drops by about 25%, 20% and 15% respectively and the annual PM2.5 in Beijing is controlled to within 60 micrograms per cubic meter.

Description of WGPG (Waste Gas Power Generation)
 
During the process of industrial production, some by-products, such as blast furnace gas, coke furnace gas, oil gas, and others are created with certain high intensive thermal energy. The waste gas can be collected and used as a fuel by gas turbine system to generate power energy.
 
Gas turbines are a set of hi-tech equipment and devices that is crucial to the energy development strategy of China. Gas turbine, which uses flammable gas as fuel and combines with recycling power generating technology, has many merits. These include high efficiency power generation, low investment, short construction periods, small land usage, water savings, environment protection and more. We believe the market prospect of the gas turbine industry is promising. On January 2013, the State Council released “Energy ‘Twelfth Five-Year’ Plan “. The Plan has proposed to focus on developing natural gas power generation. The total volume of gas power generating is expected to reach 56,000 MW, representing 16.2% growth rate compared with 2010. During the “Twelfth Five-Year” period, the newly constructed gas power generation station will reach 30,000 MW.
 
Through years of research, development and experimental applications, this gas-to-energy system has started to be applied into some high energy intensive industrial plants, such as in the course of iron-smelting in metallurgy plants. Metallurgical enterprises, as the biggest industrial energy user in China, consume 13%-15% of the nation’s electricity. Electricity consumed by the iron-smelting industry accounts for 40% of that consumed by metallurgical enterprises. If all top furnaces in the iron-smelting industry are equipped with gas recovery systems, electricity consumption may decrease by 30-45%. Furthermore, environmental pollution will be reduced while energy efficiency is improved in those heavy industries.
 
Stringent Environmental Standards and Increasing Government Supports
 
Since energy is a major strategic issue affecting the development of the Chinese economy, the Chinese government has promoted the development of recycling and encouraged enterprises to use waste energy recycling projects of the type we sell and service. Similar to previous five year periods, the China National Environment Protection Plan, for the Twelfth five year period (2011-2015), is focused on high energy consumption industries, including specific programs to support the building of waste energy recycling projects for application in iron, steel and nonferrous metal plants and in cement production lines. Given the worsening environment and insufficient energy supply in China, the Chinese government has implemented policies to curb pollution and reduce wasteful energy usage. The Renewable Energy Law, strict administrative measures to restrict investment and force consolidation in energy wasting industries, and the requirement to install energy-saving and environment protecting equipment whenever possible are just some ways the government is emphasizing the need to reduce emissions and to maximize energy creation. Local government officials, who sometimes flout central government policies for the sake of local GDP growth, are now required to tie emission, energy usage and pollution to GDP growth. If local emissions of pollutants grow faster than the local GDP, these local officials face the risk of losing their jobs. Such determination and strict enforcement by the central and local governments provide a good backdrop and growth opportunity for CREG’s business activities.

The following tables show the funds invested, or expected to be invested, in the environmental protection industry by the Chinese government.
 

Source: China National Environmental Protection Plan in the 13th Five Years (2016-2020).
 
The 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) covers a crucial period in China’s economic and social development. Environmental protection and low-carbon development will be one of the top priority considerations during that period. The government, private enterprises and the public sector will seek to jointly implement the strictest environmental protection system to realize environmental improvement, control carbon emissions, honor climate commitments and deeply participate into global climate governance. China aims to hit the CO2 emissions peak by around 2030 and reduce CO2 emissions per unit of the GDP by 60 percent to 65 percent from the 2005 level on or before 2030.
 
Waste-to-Energy is a Cost-Effective Means to Meet Rising Energy Needs
 
According to the International Energy Agency, China will need to increase its electricity generating capacity to meet its future needs. This demand may mean price increases for electricity in China. With the need for more energy, in particular energy that does not cause additional emissions, and the relative low price of the waste-to-energy production we provide, we believe that our markets will continue to expand.
 
12

 

Since China has been experiencing a dramatic surge in its energy consumption as well as widespread energy shortages, recycling energy is not only an attractive alternative to other sources of energy as part of a national diversification strategy to avoid dependence on any one energy source or politically sensitive energy supplies, but also a proven solution to make the use of energy more efficient. Under current economic conditions and current tax and regulatory regimes, waste energy recycling projects generally can create price-competitive electricity compared to electricity generated from fossil fuels or other renewable sources. Our customers can reduce energy costs significantly by installing our waste energy recycling projects. Compared to electricity from the national grid, the generating cost from recycling energy is lower, which means our customers can leverage the waste-to-energy projects to generate low-cost electricity, reducing energy costs for the manufacturing process. The current national grid electricity rate ranges from RMB 0.45-0.50/kWh and our operated recycling rate ranges from 0.35-0.45/kWh subject to project type, generating scale and local situation.
 
Customers of our energy recycling projects may also qualify for credits from the Clean Development Mechanism (“CDM”). The CDM is an international arrangement under the Kyoto Protocol allowing industrialized countries with a greenhouse gas reduction commitment to invest in ventures that reduce emissions in developing countries as an alternative to more expensive emission reductions in their own countries. In 2005, China’s government promulgated “Measures for Operation and Management of Clean Development Mechanism Projects in China” (“China CDM Measures”) to facilitate the application and operation of CDM project activities in China. Our energy recycling solutions are of a kind which falls into the beneficial categories accredited by the China CDM Measures. If our customers can get approval from the Chinese government and successfully register their projects in the United Nations’ CDM Executive Board, they can receive additional revenue income through exchanging their Certified Emission Reductions (“CER”) credits with investors in industrialized countries.
 
Trends in Industries We Principally Service
 
Iron, Steel and Nonferrous Metal Industry
 
As the biggest iron and steel producer in the world and one of the highest CO2 emission sectors, China’s iron and steel industry is undergoing a low-carbon transition accompanied by remarkable technological progress and investment adjustment, in response to the macroeconomic climate and policy intervention.
 
Environmental pollution, shortage of resources and energy shortage have been identified in China as three major challenges for China’s nonferrous metal industry. China aims to save 1.7 million tons of coal and 6 billion kWh of electricity per year, as well as reduce sulfur dioxide by 850,000 tons annually as part of the industrial upgrading for the nonferrous metallurgy sector and, at the same time, to improve the utilization efficiency for resources. In China, the utilization rate for the nonferrous metal mineral resources is 60%, which is 10 to 15% lower than developed countries. The utilization rate for associated nonferrous metals is only 40%, which is 20% lower than developed nations. In addition, parts of nonferrous mines located in different cities are disorganized with random mining, causing severe wastes of resources.
 
Coal and Petrochemicals
 
Flammable waste gases emitted from industrial production processes, such as blast furnace gas, coke furnace gas, oil or gas can be used to power gas-fired generators to create energy. Two large producers of these waste gases are coal mining and petrochemical refining. The PRC is the largest coal producer and consumer in the world. Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel and a major cause of methane gas emissions, a greenhouse gas 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Methane gas is found naturally in coal beds. In the 1950s, China began recovering methane to make mines safer. Now, as then, most of the captured methane is released into the air but it could be used as a clean energy source using waste energy recycling technologies.
Biomass Waste-to-Energy Industry
 
In China, agricultural waste and biogas are two main sources for biomass waste. China has more than 600 million tons of wasted straw produced every year. It also has 19 billion tons of forest biomass, of which 300 million tons can be utilized as an energy source. The straw burning power industry will grow faster in China with supportive policies, development of new technologies and the formation of raw material collection and storage systems, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. Electricity generated from straw has a preferential price of RMB 0.25 per kWh higher than coal-fueled power when sold to the state grid. In addition, straw power plants enjoy a series of preferential policies including tax exemption.

Biogas technology captures methane gases emitted from compostable materials and burns it to power a turbine to produce electricity. The waste that is usually disposed of in landfills is converted into liquid or gaseous fuels. By utilizing the resource from waste cellulosic or organic materials, biomass energy can be generated through the fermentation process.
 
Our Strategies 
 
Maintain Core Verticals to Increase Market Share in China
 
We focus on waste-to-energy projects for specific verticals, such as steel, cement, nonferrous metal and coal mining. We plan to continue our focus on such core verticals and leverage our expertise to expand our market share. We intend to expand our waste-to-energy power generating capacity rapidly in order to meet the anticipated growth of demand in China’s energy efficiency industrial applications and to gain market share. We continually identify potential customers in our core verticals.
Expand to New Business of Energy Storage with Future High Growth Potentials
 
We are in the process of transforming into an energy storage integrated solution provider. We plan to pursue disciplined and targeted expansion strategies for market areas that we currently do not serve. We are actively seeking and exploring opportunities to apply energy storage technologies to new industries or segments with high growth potential, including industrial and commercial complexes, large scale photovoltaic (PV) and wind power stations, remote islands without electricity, and smart energy cities with multi-energy supplies. By supporting and motivating all kinds of the electric power market to participant in resource development and utilization of demand response, we plan to provide services including peak shaving with compensation and frequency modulation. We intend to gradually form motor load performance for peak and low-hours, which will account for about 3% of the annual maximum power load on the demand side and to ensure the electricity supply and demand balance for situations of non-severe power shortages.
 
User-side energy storage is the outlet of distributed (and renewable) energy power output with high viscosity, high assets resale value, and stable cash flow income. Resource integration layout in 2019 will form an ecological chain of supply-transmission-distribution-consumption by integrating power generation assets that have high efficiency and low valuation. In this system, energy storage will play an important role to realize long distance transmission, reduce transmission loss, enhance the stability of the power supply, and provide users with multiple energy pricing mechanisms and comprehensive service. With the large-scale operation of energy storage projects in China and the Asia-pacific region, technology will gradually be improved and prices will decrease, which will provide the opportunity for vertical integration with teams in the industry that have a long time experience in the energy storage industry and technical reserves.
 
Continually Enhance Research and Development Efforts
 
We plan to devote resources to research and development in order to enhance our waste-to-energy design and engineering capabilities. We anticipate that our in-house design and engineering team will provide additional competitive advantages, including flexibility to quickly design and evaluate new technologies or applications in response to changing market trends.
 
14

 

Selectively Acquire Waste-to-Energy Power Plants 
 
While we have experienced substantial organic growth, we plan to pursue a disciplined acquisition strategy to accelerate our growth. Our strategy will focus on obtaining additional power generating capacity, research and development capabilities and access to new markets and customers.
Our Business Models
 
We have sold our products to our customers under two models: the “Build-Operate-Transfer” (the “BOT”) model and the operating lease model, although we emphasize the BOT model which we believe is more economically beneficial to us and to our customers.
 
BOT Model
 
We primarily engage in the BOT model to provide waste-to-energy solutions to our customers:
 
“Build”
 
We work directly with customers for each of our waste-to-energy projects. Our working process starts with a team of engineers that assesses and analyzes the specific needs of the customer to establish the design layout, equipment procurement list and capital expenditure budget for the project. Our sales team works closely with our engineering staff to present and negotiate the model with the customer.
 
After the signing of a contract, we finance the entire capital expenditure budget ourselves and commence the construction and installation of the project. We do not manufacture the equipment and materials that are used in the construction of the waste-to-energy power generation facility. Rather, we incorporate standard power generating equipment into a fully integrated on-site waste energy recycling project for our customer. The construction and installation period ranges from three to 12 months subject to the project type, size and complexity.
 
We usually engage an EPC general contractor, who is experienced in power plant and waste energy recycling project construction, to take charge of equipment procurement, project construction and installation. Our team of five engineers participates in and monitors the equipment purchase process; this team also oversees the construction and installation activities to ensure that they are completed on time and meet our rigorous standards and specifications.
 
“Operate”
 
After the project has been installed at the customer site and passed a series of stringent tests, we, currently, outsource the operation to a third-party vendor. The operation period ranges from 5 to 20 years subject to the terms of each contract.
 
During the operation period, the customer can purchase all the electricity at a below-market price. We collect energy-saving-based lease payments from the customer; the lease term is equivalent to the operation period, ranging from five to twenty years, and the payments are based on the sale by us as lessor to our customers as lessee of energy generated by the waste energy recycling project at below-market rates. The customer’s payments are based on a minimum operation schedule agreed upon by us with our customer, and are collateralized by assets of the customer and/or third party guarantees. To reduce risk, we offer leasing services across a wide variety of industries and only target larger manufacturers or state-owned enterprises. Operation in excess of the minimum schedule enables us to receive additional revenues from the excess energy generated and sold to the customer.
 
“Transfer”
 
Based on the specific terms for each project, we eventually transfer the waste energy recycling project to the customer at no cost or a nominal cost upon the completion of the operation/lease period.

Why BOT
 
Waste-to-energy projects are capital intensive, which requires the manufacturers to invest a considerable amount of cash to purchase equipment during the construction period. As a BOT service provider, we fund all contracted projects on our own or jointly with our customers; such financing arrangements can help our customers by removing or reducing the heavy capital expenditure burden required by specific projects, thereby allowing them to concentrate on their core business. While technologically mature in advanced countries, waste-to-energy projects are still new to most of China’s industrial companies and require intensive technology or know-how with respect to energy recycling and power generation. It is time-consuming or not feasible for industrial manufacturers to equip themselves with adequate expertise and technicians. Our specific sector knowledge and rich project experience allow us to construct, operate and maintain the power plants efficiently and to respond to operational issues in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
 
In exchange for upfront capital investment, we require secured power generating capacity during the operation period and guaranteed attractive internal rates of return from each project. Our operation period ranges from 5 to 20 years, during which we are entitled to sell the recycled electricity to those customers at a predetermined rate. Such electricity sales are secured by long-term electricity production agreements with guarantees, which result in minimum annual payments. We employ a process of stringent and systematic internal scrutiny on new customer development so as to minimize operational and default risk; for some smaller or non-SOE businesses, we require property collateral, management or third party guarantees, and/or prepayment of three months. As such, our cash inflow schedule from each in-operation project is fixed and predictable providing clear financial visibility. Our payback period is generally two to three years, depending on the project size.
 
In our experience, this BOT model is well received by our existing and potential customers in China. The insufficient supply of BOT vendors to the market is wholly due to the funding limitations of most of the recycling energy solution providers. Not all of our competitors have the ability to access sufficient capital on a timely basis.
 
Operating Lease Model
 
In the past, we also recorded rental income from two separate one-year operating leases. Under the operating leases, we leased waste-energy systems and subleased the systems to a customer for a greater amount. We choose not to renew our lease agreements, and we do not generally expect any revenue in the future through such model. In 2018, however, the Company plans to put the one Chengli project and the one Tian’an project under operating leases; these projects were under construction at the end of 2017.
Contractor and Equipment Suppliers
 
We generally conduct our project construction through an EPC general contractor. We select the EPC general contractor for each project through a bidding process; then we sign a contract with the selected contractor for that project. The general contractor may outsource parts of our project construction to subcontractors according to the complexity and economics of the project. The general contractor is responsible for purchasing equipment to satisfy the requirements of the project we design for our customer. We generally do not purchase equipment directly from the equipment suppliers, but our general contractors obtain our consent before selecting the equipment suppliers. Our engineering department is involved in the equipment supplier selection process together with our general contractors and makes sure our stringent standards and requirements have been appropriately applied in selection of the equipment. We currently have engaged Shaanxi Huaxin Energy Engineering Co., Ltd.for our projects under construction, and we also maintain relationships with many other quality general contractors in China, including Wuxi Guolian, CITIC Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., A-Power Energy Generation Systems, Ltd.
 
As mentioned above, we do not manufacture the equipment and materials that are used in the construction of our waste energy recycling projects. Rather, we incorporate standard power generating equipment into a fully integrated onsite system. The key equipment used in our projects are the boilers and turbine generators, which represent the majority of equipment cost for each project. Though we do not place the direct procurement orders, we believe we maintain good relationships with those power generation equipment suppliers, and these relationships help provide cost-effective equipment purchasing by the general contractor for our intended projects and ensure the timely completion of these projects. We have well-established business relationships with most of the suppliers from whom our general contractors procure equipment, including Hangzhou Boiler Plant, Beijing Zhongdian Electric Machinery, Chengdu Engine Group, Shanghai Electric Group, China Aviation Gas Turbine Co. Ltd and Xuji Electric. Therefore, we believe that we have a strong position and support in equipment supply and installation, which benefits us, the general contractors and our customers.

Government and Environmental Management System
 
We hold all licenses that the various levels of Chinese government require for our operations.
 
Competition
 
In the past, waste energy recycling projects have been installed mainly by the industrial plants themselves. These plants hire general contractors to purchase waste energy recycling equipment manufactured by third parties and with design support from government design institutes, which usually charge a one-time design fee, construct the projects on-site. Pressure has increased on Chinese producers to become more energy-efficient, but many mid-sized companies do not have the special technical expertise or the capital to install and operate such waste energy recycling projects. Many companies have begun to outsource these functions to third-party providers, creating an opportunity in a growing market.
 
We are a leading developer of industrial waste energy recycling projects in China. To our knowledge, we are the only non-state owned enterprise primarily using a BOT model to provide energy saving and recovery systems for various energy intensive industries, such as cement, steel and metallurgy industries. We face competition from an array of market participants.
 
Our main competitors as third-party providers are state owned research institutes or their wholly owned construction companies; however, smaller private companies occasionally employ a BOT model to provide waste-to-energy systems. The state-owned enterprises include Equipment and System Engineer Co., Ltd. of Hangzhou Steam Turbine & Power Group (Hangzhou Turbine) and Energy Saving Development Co., Ltd of China National Material Group, Sinoma Development Co., Ltd. The private companies include China Senyuan Electronic Co., Ltd., Dalian East New Energy Development Co. Ltd., Top Resource Conservation Engineering Co., Ltd. and Nanjing Kaisheng Kaineng Environmental Energy.
 
We believe that there is a larger market in the waste-to-energy industry in China for systems constructed on the “Engineering Procurement Construction” or “EPC” model in which customers purchase the services of a contractor to construct a system for the customer at the customer’s expense. Service providers include Dalian East New Energy Development, Nanjing Kaisheng Cement Technology and Engineering Co., Ltd., Jiangxi Sifang Energy Co., Ltd., Beijing Century Benefits Co., Ltd., Beijing Shineng Zhongjin Energy Technology Co., Ltd., Kunming Sunwise Co., Ltd. and China Everbright International Ltd. We compete with EPC providers for waste-to-energy projects when potential customers are able to obtain external financing or have the necessary capital.
 
We believe that we offer advantages over our competitors in several ways:
 

● | Our management team has over 20 years of industry experience and expertise; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We have the capabilities to provide TRT, CHPG and WGPG systems, while our competitors usually concentrate on one type or another;

Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
There were many new laws, regulations, rules and notices regarding the environment and energy production adopted, promulgated and put into force during past years. The Chinese government is putting more stringent requirements and urgency on reducing pollution and emissions and improving energy efficiency nationwide. Our products are designed and constructed to comply with the environmental laws and regulations of China. As our systems allow our customers to use waste heat and gases to create energy, we help reduce the overall environmental impact of our customers. Since our business focuses on recycling energy, the effect of the strengthening of environmental laws in China may be to increase demand for the products and services we offer and others like them.
