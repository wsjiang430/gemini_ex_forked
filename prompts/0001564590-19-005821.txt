 Overview
 Everbridge is a global software company that provides enterprise software applications that automate and accelerate organizations’ operational response to critical events in order to keep people safe and businesses running faster. During public safety threats such as active shooter situations, terrorist attacks or severe weather conditions, as well as critical business events such as IT outages, cyber-attacks or other incidents such as product recalls or supply-chain interruptions, our Software as a Service or “SaaS”-based platform enables our customers to quickly and reliably aggregate and assess threat data, locate people at risk and responders able to assist, automate the initiation of pre-defined emergency processes and track progress on executing response plans. Our customers use our platform to identify and assess hundreds of different types of threats to their organizations, people, assets or brand. Our solutions enable organizations to deliver intelligent, contextual messages to, and receive verification of delivery from, hundreds of millions of recipients, across multiple communications modalities such as voice, SMS and e-mail, in over 200 countries and territories, in 22 languages and dialects – all simultaneously. Our Critical Event Management platform is comprised of a comprehensive set of software applications that address the full spectrum of tasks an organization has to perform to manage a critical event, including Mass Notification, Incident Management, Safety Connection, IT Alerting, Visual Command Center, Population Alerting, Crisis Commander, Community Engagement and Secure Messaging. We believe that our broad suite of integrated, enterprise applications delivered via a single global platform is a significant competitive advantage in the market for Critical Event Management solutions, which we refer to generally as CEM.
 In critical situations, the speed at which threats are assessed and information is transmitted and accessed is essential. For example, United States Department of Homeland Security research indicates that the average duration of an active shooter event at a school is approximately 12.5 minutes, while the average police response time to such events is 18 minutes. Accordingly, organizations must be able to aggregate multiple types of threat and incident data and determine whether their people, assets, or suppliers could be impacted, rapidly deliver messages that are tailored to multiple, specific audiences, in precise locations and be assured of delivery. Further, the proliferation of mobile and digital communications has resulted in individuals spending less time in a fixed office location, with International Data Corporation estimating that by 2020 mobile workers will account for 72% of the total United States workforce, and this trend has simultaneously increased the number of pathways through which people receive information. These developments have made it imperative that organizations be able to locate travelling or remote workers to determine who might be impacted by a critical event, and that critical communications be delivered via voice, SMS, and email, as well as to social media, outdoor signage and personal computers. Moreover, organizations require the ability to leverage all of these pathways, individually or in sequence, to reach people in situations where a certain means of communication may be inoperative or individuals are not responsive to a single pathway. During public safety threats and critical business events, the ability to gather, organize and analyze data in real time, and to enable secure, scalable, reliable and automated communications to people can be essential to saving lives, protecting assets and maintaining businesses. Further, the ability to rapidly organize a response by locating available responders and reducing the time required to initiate action can also result in significant economic savings, as each minute of unplanned downtime costs organizations an average of approximately $8,900, according to the Ponemon Institute.
 The severity, complexity and frequency of these critical events, their implications for business performance and personal safety, and regulatory and compliance challenges are increasing. The need for active shooter preparedness and public safety protection from terrorist attacks, as well managing the response to IT outages, cyber incidents, severe weather conditions, product recalls, supply-chain interruptions, hazardous material discharges and other urgent events, drive the need for a secure, scalable and reliable CEM system that can be operated quickly and easily. In addition, there has been a rapid proliferation of connected devices and networked physical objects – the Internet of Things, or IoT – that have the capability to communicate information about status and environment and generate data that enables individuals and enterprises to take appropriate action. These dynamics have led to a growing need for solutions that can increase the speed and completeness of assessing threats and can deliver comprehensive yet targeted and contextually relevant content that facilitates the desired outcomes in critical situations and overcomes the information overload that individuals face. We estimate, based on data from Frost & Sullivan, presented in an independent study commissioned by us, and data from Markets and Markets, that the market for CEM solutions represents a $41.0 billion worldwide opportunity in 2020.

Following the tragic events of 9/11, Everbridge was founded with a vision of helping people communicate effectively in critical situations. Our SaaS-based CEM platform is built on a secure, scalable and reliable infrastructure with multiple layers of redundancy to enable the rapid assessment of threat data and delivery of critical communications, with near real-time verification, over numerous devices and contact paths. Our Mass Notification application is our most established application and enables enterprises and governmental entities to aggregate and assess threat data, locate people based on their standard work or home location and send and receive two-way, contextually aware notifications to individuals or groups to keep them informed before, during and after natural or man-made disasters and other emergencies. For example, during Hurricane Irma, our Mass Notification application was used in the state of Florida to deliver more than 18 million communications. By automating the delivery of these types of critical communications, we enable customers to increase the speed and accuracy of their response and reduce associated costs. Importantly, given the pressure and anxiety most people experience in critical situations, our Mass Notification application provides a simple user interface and automated workflows for ease of use. The expertise that we garnered developing our Mass Notification application and our customers’ reliance on our solutions led us to leverage our platform to deploy solutions for CEM use cases. In turn, we have developed a full suite of enterprise-scale applications that enable our customers to inform and organize people during critical situations, whether a broad audience or a targeted subset of individuals, globally or locally, and accounting for cultural, linguistic, regulatory and technological differences. As all of our applications leverage our CEM platform, customers can use a single contacts database, rules engine of algorithms and hierarchies and user interface to accomplish multiple objectives. Our applications are easy-to-use, quickly deployable and require limited implementation services and no development resources.
 The following situations reflect examples of how our applications aggregate and assess data and enable improved management of critical events:
  
• | When an active shooter situation or terrorist attack occurs, organizations can quickly identify employees in the affected area, including employees not at their usual business location, in order to confirm that they are safe and provide tailored instructions. For example, shelter-in-place instructions may be provided to people in an impacted building while evacuation instructions are provided to those in an adjacent building. At the same time, first responders and hospitals can use multiple modes of alerting to mobilize resources and call in staff to provide emergency care.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a hurricane is imminent, local emergency management departments can alert affected communities with relevant safety and evacuation instructions while companies can put in place emergency plans to notify employees of office closures while coordinating work assignments to maintain the continuity of core operations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Companies can consolidate separate command centers for emergency operations and supply chain events, using one common data set to aggregate and assess data on severe weather, political unrest and other types of threats to their own and suppliers’ operations, thereby reducing costs while gaining efficiencies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When IT systems fail, IT administrators can shorten the time required to alert cross-department responders, use scheduling information to determine availability and quickly assemble appropriate personnel on a conference bridge, thereby reducing the costs incurred from downtime.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a patient is suspected of having a stroke, an on-call specialist can provide a patient assessment via video communications during the ambulance trip and the emergency room can be readied for an immediate stroke treatment, accelerating critical time to treatment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a cyber incident shuts down an IT network, management can alert employees of the network shutdown via a secure, alternate communication path.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a power line is down, utility workers can utilize pre-configured incident management templates to alert affected customers and responders and provide service updates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When engine readings in critical equipment detect a malfunction, technicians with the appropriate skills can be automatically alerted and quickly deployed to minimize downtime and avoid revenue loss or service interruption.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | When readings from an implanted medical device are abnormal, that information can be automatically routed to the individual’s healthcare provider to enable timely medical care.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a young child goes missing, local officials can send alerts to and receive tips from their communities to aid in locating and returning the child.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a financial services firm experiences disruptions in service, clients can be promptly notified and audit confirmations can be provided to document delivery.

Evolution of Critical Event Management Solutions
 Traditional solutions for critical communications have not kept pace with the increasingly digital world, the evolving threat landscape and the opportunity to leverage technological innovation to more effectively gain situational awareness and to communicate with people. These solutions are often developed in-house or are not truly enterprise grade in scale and reliability, leaving many organizations to manually evaluate multiple streams of threat data and to use analog, one-way and people-based modalities to communicate with relevant stakeholders. These solutions lack the scale to reliably address the breadth of the different critical challenges that organizations increasingly face, the sophistication required to address evolving needs with aggregated data and analysis for threat assessment, automated workflows and the ability to rapidly deliver messages that are contextually tailored to multiple, specific audiences, in precise locations, using a variety of different communication modalities. Traditional solutions also typically determine a person’s location for threat assessment and availability for response, and send notifications, based upon astatic work or home address. Given the mobile nature of today’s workforce, solutions now need to be able to dynamically locate who is near a critical event and send instructions to impacted parties and responders based upon where they actually are.
 CEM solutions build upon the strengths of modern critical communications. Organizations today typically manage critical events across the organization in silos that use disparate data sources and unintegrated tools, making it difficult to achieve a common operational view of threats and of the status of response. Utilizing a common contact base, consistent rules engines, threat databases that are integrated with information on the location of an organization’s people, assets and suppliers, and a common visualization platform, CEM solutions can provide a more integrated solution which can improve management control and visibility and lower costs. The ability to cohesively and rapidly share information and collaborate across the organization underlies creating a common operational approach.

Our Growth Strategy
 We intend to drive growth in our business by building on our position as a global provider of critical event management, critical communications and enterprise safety applications. Key elements of our growth strategy include:

• | Accelerate Our Acquisition of New Customers. We have multiple paths of entry into new customers with our portfolio of applications, which are used for a wide variety of use cases across a diverse set of verticals markets. We intend to capitalize on the breadth of our solutions and the technological advantages of our CEM platform to continue to attract new customers. In parallel, we plan to attract new customers by investing in sales and marketing and expanding our channel partner relationships. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Further Penetrate Our Existing Customers. With revenue retention rates of over 110% for each of the last three years, we believe that there is a significant opportunity within our existing customer base to expand their use of our platform, both by selling new applications and features to our existing customers and selling to additional departments in their organizations. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to increase the lifetime value of our customer relationships as we educate customers about the benefits of our current and future applications that they do not already utilize and of taking an integrated CEM approach. In the last three years we have added five new applications, which have already begun to experience significant growth. These new applications have grown from 6% in the first quarter of 2016 to 55% in the fourth quarter of 2018 of our contracted sales, which represent the total dollar value of new agreements entered into within the prior 12 months, exclusive of renewals. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop New Applications to Target New Markets and Use Cases. Our platform is highly flexible and can support the development of new applications to meet evolving safety and operational challenges. For example, our Safety Connection application enables organizations to locate people and send them notifications based on their dynamic last known location, while actively incorporating threat and other data to allow for targeted and relevant communications. While the historic market for corporate security and safety solutions has been focused on establishing perimeters – locks, alarms and guards – to keep threats to employees outside of the physical premises, our solutions are responsive to the dramatic shift towards an increasingly mobile workforce where employees spend less time in traditional offices. At the same time, protection of employees at traditional places of business remains crucial. Market research completed in 2017 by us together with Emergency Management & Safety Solutions, found that while organizations were very concerned about the risk of workplace violence, 79% said they were at best only somewhat prepared for an active shooter event, and communicating with people in an impacted building was seen as the biggest challenge. In light of these dynamics, we intend to continue to develop new applications for use cases in a variety of new markets and to leverage our platform and our existing customer relationships as a source of new applications, industry use cases, features and solutions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Our International Footprint. We intend to continue to expand our local presence in regions such as Europe, the Middle East and Asia to leverage our relationships with local carriers and our ability to deliver messages to over 200 countries and territories in 22 languages and dialects as well as expand our channel partnerships and also to opportunistically consider expanding in other regions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain Our Technology and Thought Leadership. We will continue to invest in our core CEM platform and our applications to maintain our technology leadership position. For example, we believe that we are the only company today that provides a full, integrated CEM solution and that we provide the first solution to offer dynamic versus static location awareness integrated with analysis and communications for the employee safety and security marketplace. Further, we believe we have a competitive advantage through our commitment to innovation and thought leadership that has enabled us to take market share from our competitors and accelerate our growth. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Opportunistically Pursue Acquisitions. We plan to selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies and teams that allow us to penetrate new markets and add features and functionalities to our platform. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Contact Stores
 Our contact stores manage approximately 270 million contact profiles and connections from more than 4,400 customers based in 49 countries as of December 31, 2018, up from 15 million contact profiles as of December 31, 2012. They are initially created through an upload of contacts from the customer and are automatically updated with the most current contact information provided by the customer or by individuals who opt-in to receive notification from our Community Engagement application. Our contact stores are simultaneously enriched by geographic, situational and other real-time data. Our contact stores are repositories for all contact details, attributes and business rules and preferences, such as a person’s last-known location, language spoken, special needs, technical certifications and on-call status.

We leverage the data contained in our contact stores in a number of significant ways. Our data asset across multiple verticals enables us to develop best practices for reaching the intended contact, on the correct device, at the right location, at the appropriate time. We also use these data to better understand our customer base and their emerging use cases in order to improve our existing applications and develop new applications.
 Everbridge Publishing Network
 An important component of our platform is our Everbridge Publishing Network, which allows our customers to share relevant situational awareness information with each other. Public safety agencies, for example, can publish information to the Everbridge Publishing Network about incidents that might prove disruptive to the movement of people, goods and services for businesses within a certain area. If any of those businesses are also customers of ours, they will receive this information from a source they know is vetted and reliable and will be able to take timely steps to mitigate or remediate the situation.
Our Applications
 Through our CEM platform, we deliver reliable enterprise-ready applications that provide organizations with the ability to assess threats, locate people, automate actions, monitor incident response, and deliver contextual communications in any volume, in near-real time. We have designed our applications’ user interface to be easy to use. We understand that since some of our applications will be utilized to manage complex situations or to send large volumes of messages to key stakeholders during stressful situations, streamlining the user interface to reduce user errors and anxiety is essential. We conduct extensive usability testing and design reviews with our stakeholders, and have applied in our designs the lessons learned over more than a decade of working with critical communications users and professionals.
 Our applications enable:
  
• | Communications to key stakeholders during emergency situations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Corporate communications with customers and employees.
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | Automated outreach to on-call personnel.
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Integrated threat assessment and visualization.
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Integration of physical security data with location awareness data gathered from travel, network and access systems to rapidly find and communicate with employees during disruptive events.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Securely designed and efficiently implemented communications among healthcare providers and patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Community engagement and collaboration with citizens and businesses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Critical IoT communications between machines and from machines to people
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mobile response plan deployment and management of incidence response.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our applications include:
  
• | Mass Notification. Our secure, scalable and reliable Mass Notification application is our most established application and enables enterprises and governmental entities to send contextually aware notifications to individuals or groups to keep them informed before, during and after natural or man-made disasters and other emergencies. We provide robust analytics, map-based targeting, flexible group management, distributed contact data, language localization, multiple options for contact data management and a globally-optimized approach to voice and SMS routing. We also support community engagement functionality, which provides a direct link between residents and emergency management departments with the goal of fostering public safety.

• | Safety Connection. Our Safety Connection application enables organizations to send notifications based on dynamic last known location of an individual, including the airport, street, building floor or conference room at which the individual was most recently present, while actively incorporating threat and other data to allow for targeted and relevant communications. When fully deployed, the application can also aggregate near real-time data from multiple sources, including building access control systems, wired and wireless network access points, travel management systems and mobile application check-ins. We believe that Safety Connection represents a significant advance in helping organizations use critical communications to keep their constituents safe, as many current solutions use only static office and residential locations that are not sufficiently location-aware relative to an increasingly mobile workforce.

• | Incident Management. Our Incident Management application enables organizations to automate workflows and make their communications contextually relevant using drag and drop business rules to determine who should be contacted, how they should be contacted and what information is required. We believe that this application decreases costly human errors and reduces downtime, while simultaneously capturing required compliance information. We also support cross-account collaboration and situational intelligence sharing during crises for corporations and communities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IT Alerting. Our IT Alerting application enables IT professionals to alert and communicate with key members of their teams during an IT incident or outage, including during a cyber security breach. The application integrates with IT service management platforms, including ServiceNow, and uses automatic escalation of alerts, on-call scheduling and mobile alerting to automate manual tasks and keep IT teams collaborating during an incident. We also provide real-time shift calendars with integrated on-call notifications to help users better manage employee resources and get the right message to the right person, at the right time through automated staffing. Taken together, our IT Alerting application has the potential to provide meaningful savings to organizations by reducing mean-time-to-repair. Each minute of unplanned downtime costs organizations an average of approximately $8,900 according to Ponemon Institute, while 59% of Fortune 500 companies experience 1.6 hours of downtime per week, according to Dunn & Bradstreet. IHS, Inc. estimates information and communication technology downtime costs North American organizations $700 billion per year.

• | Visual Command Center. Our Visual Command Center application enables customers to monitor and integrate more than 100 types of threat data, as well as information on internal incidents, to generate and visualize an alert when potential risks occur within proximity of an organization’s physical locations, suppliers, assets or people. The solution improves the ability to more quickly understand and assess the impact of threats, execute the correct response, and monitor on-going resolution in order to mitigate risk to personnel safety, business continuity, assets and supply chain operations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Population Alerting. Our Population Alerting application is used to reach international mobile populations on a regional or country-wide scale. It leverages existing telecom infrastructure to anonymously reach mobile phone users within a geographic area with two-way SMS communications without requiring an existing database of mobile phone numbers. Multichannel alerting can also be accomplished via mobile push notifications, cell broadcast, voice, email, or messaging to electronic display boards or radio. The application has been deployed as part of the national warning system for multiple countries including Sweden, the Netherlands, Greece, Cambodia, and a number of the largest states in India.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Community Engagement. Our Community Engagement application integrates emergency management and community outreach by providing local governments with a unified solution to connect residents to their public safety department, public information resources, and neighbors via social media and mobile applications. This creates a stronger and more engaged community improving the communication reach for emergency personnel, while providing residents with real-time emergency and community information, and allows residents to anonymously opt-in and provide tips. For example, the City of Philadelphia experienced a 70% increase in opt-ins in 2016 with our Community Engagement application.

Our Technology
 The design and development of our applications, and our critical communication and critical event management platforms include the following key attributes:
  
• | Robust, Enterprise-Grade Scalability and Reliability. Given the mission-critical nature of our solutions, our multi-tenant platform was designed to provide a robust, high level of resiliency, scalability and redundancy. We use multiple geographically distributed service providers and communications carriers to achieve a high degree of redundancy, fault tolerance and cost-effective operations. We have multiple layers of redundancy and a horizontal scaling model across our infrastructure to deliver high availability and performance. Our redundant data centers are located in Los Angeles, California; Denver, Colorado; San Francisco, California; Ashburn, Virginia; St. Louis, Missouri; and Toronto, Canada as well as in Germany, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Similarly, we leverage redundant downstream communications providers to enable our services to remain uninterrupted even if a particular provider encounters technical difficulties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Multi-Modal, Globally Local Communications Delivery. We optimize international call routing across hundreds of telecommunications providers to enable higher voice quality, improved delivery rates during emergencies and the ability to configure local caller IDs to improve recognition and answer rates. We also work with multiple SMS providers to identify regulatory hurdles and deploy and actively manage an optimal mix of national and international SMS codes to ensure high delivery and response rates. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Security and Compliance. Our security and data protection policies and controls are based on the Federal Information Security Management Act risk management framework defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, special publication, or SP, 800-37. To meet the rigorous standards of our enterprise and government customers, an independent and accredited third-party security assessment firm annually verifies our compliance with over 800 security and data protection requirements detailed in NIST SP 800-53. Through this process, we map our compliance with other security and data privacy frameworks including ISO 27001 and HIPAA. In addition, we hold certifications including SysTrust Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18, Service Operations Controls 2 & 3. We have also been awarded approvals by DHS that enable us to receive priority treatment for vital voice and data circuits or other telecommunications services. More recently, our critical communications solutions received designation under the SAFETY Act and certification by DHS that places us on the approved product list for homeland security and provides us with the highest level of liability protection available under the SAFETY Act. The certification similarly protects our customers from legal liability claims arising from acts of terrorism, as contemplated by the SAFETY Act. Further, our solutions are accredited under FISMA and we are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield to meet regulatory requirements governing the processing of European Union residents’ personal data outside of the European Union. Our Everbridge Suite solution also achieved authorization under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) in 2018, that required satisfying a rigorous security and risk management review process and which we believe provides an advantage for selling into the U.S. federal sector.

• | Dynamic Location Detection. Our platform can create and update dynamic data sets containing a contact’s last-known location, including the airport, street, building floor or conference room at which the contact was most recently present. Multiple data sources can be aggregated including building access control and badging systems, wired and wireless network access points, and corporate travel management and office hoteling systems. These data are used to best locate a contact in an emergency or critical business situation, independent of the contact’s home or office location. Contacts can also share their location via a three-in-one mobile panic button application, which sends a panic message to the applicable organization’s security team, and also includes the ability to send audio and video content, to check-in to capture and report geo-location data and to establish a safe corridor through a potentially unsafe area.

Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing organizations collaborate to create brand preference, efficiently and effectively generate leads, build a strong sales pipeline and cultivate customer relationships to help drive revenue growth. Our go-to-market strategy consists of a strong thought-leadership program, digital marketing engine and a diversified sales organization designed to efficiently sell across vertical markets to organizations of all sizes. We have dedicated sales teams focused on corporate customers, healthcare organizations and government customers, which covers U.S. federal, state and local governmental entities.
 We believe that our sales and marketing model is economically compelling. We spent $1.00 to generate each $1.00 of new sales in each of 2018 and 2017, respectively, which reflects our sales and marketing expense incurred in 2018 and 2017 (other than expense related to employees dedicated to client retention) compared to 12 months of contract value for contracts entered into in 2018 and 2017, and $0.06 to renew each $1.00 of renewal sales in each of 2018 and 2017, which reflects our sales and marketing expense related to employees dedicated to client retention compared to 12 months of contract value for contracts renewed in 2018 and 2017.
 Sales
 We sell our solutions through our telephone and direct inside sales teams, a direct field sales team and a growing partner channel. Our global sales teams focus on both new customer acquisition and up-selling and cross-selling additional and new offerings, respectively, to our existing customers. Our sales teams are organized by geography, consisting of the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; as well as by target organization size. Our inside sales team focuses typically on small and middle-market transactions, while larger or more complex transactions are generally handled by our direct field sales teams. Our highly trained sales engineers help define customer use cases, manage pilots and train channel partners.
 In addition to the vertical and geographic distribution of our salesforce, we have dedicated teams of account executives focused on net new accounts and growth of existing accounts, account managers responsible for renewal of existing accounts, and business development representatives targeting new and growth business opportunity creation. Our sales representatives use phone, email and web meetings to interact with prospects and customers. In 2018, we increased the headcount of our sales organization, and we intend to continue to invest in building our global sales and go-to-market organizations.
 We also sell through channel partners both domestically and internationally. To help integrate our applications with other third-party services and take advantage of current and emerging technologies, we seek to enter into alliances with leading technology companies.
 Marketing
 We focus our marketing efforts on increasing the strength of the Everbridge brand, communicating product advantages and business benefits, generating leads for our salesforce and channel partners, leveraging geographic market strengths and driving product adoption. We run campaigns that take advantage of a network effect in which success within a region encourages other organizations within that area to choose our solutions, in part to be using a system consistent with that of other entities in the area with which they may share information or best practices. We deliver targeted content to demonstrate our thought leadership in critical communications best practices and use digital advertising methods to drive conversion of potential prospects, which convert to opportunities for our sales organization.
 Our marketing team focuses on inbound marketing through our industry-leading content, resources, and sharing customer best practices. We rely on multiple marketing and sales automation tools to efficiently market to, and automatically identify qualified individuals using product and industry specific criteria. We use multiple marketing tactics to engage with prospective customers including: email marketing, event marketing, print and digital advertising, and webinar events. We engage with existing customers to provide vertically-based education and awareness and to promote expanded use of our current and new software offerings within these customers. We also host regional and national events to engage both customers and prospects, deliver product training and foster community.
 15


Research and Development
 We invest substantial resources in research and development and leverage offshore development in multiple geographies to implement a “follow the sun” engineering strategy and to increase the efficiency of our overall development efforts. We enhance our core technology platform and applications, develop new end market-specific solutions and applications, and conduct application and quality assurance testing. Our technical and engineering team monitors and tests our applications on a regular basis, and we maintain a regular release process to refine, update, and enhance our existing applications. Research and development expense totaled $41.3 million, $22.2 million and $14.8 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Our Competition
 The market for CEM solutions is highly fragmented, intensely competitive and constantly evolving. We compete with an array of established and emerging companies, many of whom are single product or single market focused, as well as in-house solutions. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to remain intense going forward. The primary competitors for our Mass Notification and Incident Management applications include: BlackBerry Limited, F24 AG, Enera Inc., Nuance Communications, Inc., OnSolve, LLC, Rave Wireless, Inc. and SunGard Data Systems Inc. The primary competitors for our IT Alerting application include: PagerDuty, Inc. and xMatters, Inc. The primary competitors for our Secure Messaging application include: DocHalo, LLC, Spok, Inc., Perfect Serve, Inc. and TigerText, Inc. With respect to our recent acquisitions, the primary competitors for our Crisis Commander application includes In Case of Crisis. The primary competitor for our Population Alerting application is one2many.
 We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:
  
• | product functionality, including local and multi-modal delivery in international markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth of offerings;
--+----------------------


• | performance, security, scalability and reliability;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with local regulations and multi-language support;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | brand recognition, reputation and customer satisfaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | ease of implementation, use and maintenance; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | total cost of ownership.
--+-------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors and that we are well positioned as a leading provider of targeted and contextually relevant critical communications.
 Intellectual Property
 Our future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the United States and other jurisdictions.
 We have numerous issued patents and patent applications pending. We cannot assure you that any patents will issue from any patent applications, that patents that issue from such applications will give us the protection that we seek or that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future from our pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
 We have registered the “Everbridge” and “Nixle” names in the United States and have registered the “Everbridge” name in the European Union. We have registrations and/or pending applications for additional marks in the United States; however, we cannot assure you that any future trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.
 16


We also license software from third parties for integration into our offerings, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.
 We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include everbridge.com, as well as similar variations on that name.
 In order to protect our unpatented proprietary technologies and processes, we rely on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and others. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or develop similar technologies and processes. Further, the contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights.
 If we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop solutions that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our solutions infringe their proprietary rights.
 Patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in our industry and we have been involved in such disputes from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. They may also assert such claims against our customers whom we typically indemnify against claims that our solution infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights of third parties. As the numbers of products and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. Any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business.
 Government Regulation
 We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, export taxation or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation. For a discussion of risks related to these various areas of government regulation, see the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Culture and Employees
 We believe that our culture has been a key contributor to our success to-date and that the critical nature of the solutions that we provide promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our employees. We have invested in building a strong corporate culture and believe it is one of our most important and sustainable sources of competitive advantage.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 777 full-time employees, including 173 in data center operations and customer support, 286 in sales and marketing, 229 in research and development and 89 in general and administrative. As of December 31, 2018, we had 558 full-time employees in the United States and 219 full-time employees internationally. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.

Legal Proceedings
 From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
