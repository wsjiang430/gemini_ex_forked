ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Overview
XPO Logistics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries (“XPO,” “XPO Logistics,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”), is a top ten global provider of cutting-edge supply chain solutions to the most successful companies in the world. The Company operates as a highly integrated network of people, technology and physical assets. We use our network to help our customers manage their goods most efficiently through their supply chains. Our revenue derives from a mix of key verticals, such as retail and e-commerce, food and beverage, consumer packaged goods and industrial. As of December 31, 2018, we operated with more than 100,000 employees and 1,535 locations in 32 countries and served over 50,000 customers.
We run our business on a global basis, with two reporting segments: Transportation and Logistics. In 2018, approximately 65% of our revenue came from Transportation; the other 35% came from Logistics. Within each segment, we have robust service offerings that are positioned to capitalize on fast-growing areas of customer demand. Substantially all of our services operate under the single brand of XPO Logistics.
Transportation Segment
We offer customers an unmatched transportation network of multiple modes, flexible capacity and route density to transport freight quickly and cost effectively from origin to destination. Our scale and service range are significant advantages — both for XPO, as competitive differentiators, and for our customers, who depend on us to provide reliable capacity under all market conditions.
Within our Transportation segment, as of December 31, 2018, our largest service offerings were freight brokerage and truckload, and less-than-truckload (“LTL”), which contributed 27% and 28%, respectively, to our consolidated revenue in 2018. By comparison, in 2017, freight brokerage and truckload and LTL contributed approximately 27%
4

and 29%, respectively, to our consolidated revenue. In 2016, freight brokerage and truckload and LTL contributed approximately 25% and 29%, respectively, to our consolidated revenue.
Globally, we are the second largest freight brokerage provider, and a top five provider of managed transportation based on the value of freight under management. Many of our transportation services hold market-leading positions in North America and Europe. In North America, we are the largest provider of last mile logistics for heavy goods; the largest manager of expedited shipments; a top three provider of LTL transportation; and a top three provider of intermodal services, with a national drayage network. We are also a freight forwarder with a global network of ocean, air, ground and cross-border services.
In Europe, we provide full truckload transportation as dedicated and non-dedicated services using the Company’s fleet, which is the largest owned road fleet in Europe, and as a brokered service using independent carriers. Our other transportation offerings in Europe are LTL transportation, which we provide through one of the largest LTL networks in Western Europe, and last mile logistics. Our total lane density in Europe covers the regions that produce approximately 90% of the eurozone’s gross domestic product.
We use a blended model of owned, contracted and brokered capacity for truck transportation. This gives us extensive flexibility to provide solutions that best serve the interests of our customers and the Company. The non-asset portion of our model is predominately variable cost and includes our brokerage operations, as well as contracted capacity with independent providers. As of December 31, 2018, globally, we had approximately 12,000 independent carriers and owner-operators under contract to provide drayage, expedite, last mile and LTL services to our customers, and more than 50,000 independent brokered carriers representing over 1,000,000 trucks on the road.
We employ professional drivers that transport goods for customers using our fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers. Globally, our road fleet encompasses approximately 16,000 tractors and approximately 39,000 trailers, primarily related to our LTL operations in North America and our full truckload operations in Europe. These assets also provide supplemental capacity for our freight brokerage operations as needed. Our company overall is asset-light, with the revenue generated by activities directly associated with our owned assets accounting for less than a third of our revenue in 2018.
Logistics Segment
In our Logistics segment, which we sometimes refer to as supply chain or contract logistics, we have deep expertise in key verticals, and strong positions in fast-growing sectors, such as e-fulfillment, returns management and temperature-controlled warehousing. We provide a range of contract logistics services for customers, including value-added warehousing and distribution, omnichannel and e-commerce fulfillment, cold chain solutions, reverse logistics and surge management. In addition, our Logistics segment provides highly engineered, customized solutions and supply chain optimization services, such as volume flow management. Once we secure a logistics contract, the average tenure is approximately five years and the relationship can lead to a wider use of our services, such as inbound and outbound logistics. Our Logistics segment contributed approximately 35%, 34% and 32% to our consolidated revenue in each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
We operate 190 million square feet (18 million square meters) of contract logistics facility space worldwide, making XPO the second largest contract logistics provider. Approximately 91 million square feet (8 million square meters) of our logistics space is in the United States, where we are a market leader in logistics capacity. Our expansive footprint makes us particularly attractive to large customers with multinational operations. Our logistics customers include many of the preeminent names in retail and e-commerce, food and beverage, technology, aerospace, wireless, industrial and manufacturing, chemical, agribusiness, life sciences and healthcare.
We also benefit from a strong position in the high-growth e-commerce sector. E-commerce is predicted to continue to grow globally at a double-digit rate through at least 2020, making it difficult for many companies to handle fulfillment in-house while providing a high level of service. Demand in the e-commerce sector is characterized by strong seasonal surges in activity; the fourth quarter peak is typically the most dramatic, when holiday orders are placed online.
We are the largest outsourced e-fulfillment provider in Europe, and we have a major platform for e-fulfillment in North America, where we provide highly customized solutions that include reverse logistics and omnichannel services. Our experience with fast-growing e-commerce categories makes us a valuable partner to customers who 
5

want to outsource order fulfillment, product returns, testing, refurbishment, warranty management, refunding, order personalization and other value-added services. Together with our last mile expertise with heavy goods, our logistics capabilities provide e-commerce companies with superior control, flexible warehousing options and labor, advanced automation and a national network of home delivery hubs.
Operating Philosophy 
We believe that our ability to provide customers with integrated, end-to-end supply chain solutions gives us a significant competitive advantage. Many customers, particularly large companies, prefer to use large, multimodal service providers to manage more than one aspect of the supply chain. Additionally, we have positioned the Company to capitalize on the ongoing growth in e-commerce, and on secular trends in demand, such as outsourcing and just-in-time inventory practices.
Two hallmarks of our operations are technology and sustainability.
We prioritize innovation because we believe that advanced technology is critical to continuously improving customer service, controlling costs and leveraging our scale. Our 2018 investment in technology was approximately $500 million, among the highest in our industry.
We concentrate our efforts in four areas of innovation: automation and intelligent machines, dynamic data science, the digital freight marketplace, and visibility and customer service, specifically in the e-commerce supply chain. Our global team of approximately 1,700 technology professionals can deploy proprietary software very rapidly on our cloud-based platform. Our focus is on developing innovations that differentiate our services, create benefits for our customers and value for our shareholders. For example, we have the ability to share data with our customers in real time, including visibility of orders moving through fulfillment and shipments in transit. Our technology gives us a birds-eye view of real-time market conditions and pricing for truckload, intermodal and LTL, and facilitates load assignments with our independent contractors, all of which greatly enhances customer service.
In addition, we have a strong commitment to sustainability. We own the largest natural gas truck fleet in Europe and we launched government-approved mega-trucks in Spain as two of numerous initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint. In 2018, we made substantial investments in fuel-efficient Freightliner Cascadia tractors in North America; these use EPA 2013-compliant and GHG14-compliant Selective Catalytic Reduction (“SCR”) technology. In Europe, our tractors are approximately 98% compliant with Euro V, EEV and Euro VI standards, making our fleet one of the most modern in the industry. Our Company has been awarded the label “Objectif CO2” for outstanding environmental performance of transport operations in Europe by the French Ministry of the Environment and the French Environment and Energy Agency.
A number of our logistics facilities are ISO 14001-certified, which ensures environmental and other regulatory compliances. We monitor fuel emissions from forklifts, with protocols in place to take immediate corrective action if needed. Company packaging engineers ensure that the optimal carton size is used for each product slated for distribution and, as a byproduct of reverse logistics, we recycle millions of electronic components and batteries each year. We are committed to operating in a progressive and environmentally sound manner, with the greatest efficiency and the least waste possible.
Transportation Services
The Company’s Transportation segment includes freight brokerage (which encompasses truck brokerage, intermodal, drayage and expedite), last mile, LTL, full truckload, global forwarding and managed transportation services led by highly experienced operators.
Freight Brokerage
Our truck brokerage operations are non-asset-based: we place shippers’ freight with qualified carriers, primarily trucking companies. Customers offer loads to us via electronic data interchange, email, telephone and the internet on a daily basis. Truck brokerage services are priced on either a spot market or contract basis for shippers. We collect payments from our customers and pay the carriers for transporting customer loads. Our proprietary, cloud-based brokerage platform, Freight Optimizer, gives us real-time visibility into truckload supply and demand. Freight Optimizer is also the technology behind XPO Connect, our digital freight marketplace, which connects shippers and carriers in a virtual environment.
6

Our intermodal operations are asset-light: we provide customers with container capacity, brokered rail transportation, drayage transportation via independent contractors, and on-site operational services. We lease or own approximately 9,500 53-ft. containers and approximately 5,000 chassis. We utilize this equipment, together with access to supplemental capacity, to meet our customers’ intermodal requirements.
We have a sophisticated infrastructure in place to work with the railroads in providing the long-haul portion of freight shipments in containers, and we contract with independent drayage trucking companies for local pickup and delivery. We also provide customized electronic tracking and analysis of market prices and negotiated rates through our proprietary Rail Optimizer technology, which we use to determine the optimal configurations of truck and rail.
We offer our door-to-door intermodal services to a wide range of customers in North America, including large industrial and retail shippers, transportation intermediaries, such as intermodal marketing companies, and steamship lines. As of December 31, 2018, XPO was the third largest provider of intermodal services in North America, with one of the largest U.S. drayage networks, and a leading provider of intermodal services in the cross-border Mexico sector.
Our expedite operations are predominantly non-asset-based — we use a network of contracted owner-operators for expedited ground transportation, and an electronic bid platform for air charter loads. Another large component of our expedite offering is our proprietary transportation management platform, which awards loads electronically based on online bids by carriers. These transactions primarily happen on a machine-to-machine basis. Our technology initiates a new auction on the internet, and we take a fee for facilitating the process.
Our expedite services can be characterized as time-critical, time-sensitive or high priority freight shipments, many of which have special handling needs. Urgent needs for expedited transportation typically arise due to tight tolerances in a customer’s supply chain, or some kind of disruption to the supply chain. 
Expedite customers most often request our services on a per-load transactional basis through our offices or via our proprietary online portals. Only a small percentage of loads are scheduled for future delivery dates. We operate an ISO 9001:2008-certified call center that gives our customers on-demand status updates related to their expedited shipments. As of December 31, 2018, XPO was the largest manager of expedited freight shipments in North America.
Last Mile Logistics
Our last mile operations in North America and Europe primarily specialize in heavy goods, including appliances, furniture, large electronics and other items that are larger-than-parcel. As of December 31, 2018, XPO was the largest provider of last mile logistics for heavy goods in North America, having arranged approximately 40,000 deliveries a day on average in 2018.
Our last mile services are predominantly asset-light; we utilize independent contractors to perform transportation and over-the-threshold deliveries and installations. In North America, these services are facilitated through a large network of XPO last mile hubs. As of December 31, 2018, we had 85 hubs operating in North America, extending our footprint to within 125 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population and further reducing transit times for goods. We also have a small last mile business in Europe.
Last mile comprises the final stage of the delivery from a local distribution center or retail store to the end-customer’s home or business, where additional services are often required. It is a fast-growing industry sector that serves blue chip retailers, e-commerce companies and smaller retailers that have limited in-house capabilities for deliveries and installations. Important aspects of last mile service are responsiveness to seasonal demand, economies of scale, advanced technology and an ability to maintain a consistently high quality of customer experience.
The last mile process often requires incremental services, such as unpacking, assembly, utility connection, installation and testing, as well as the removal of an old product. These additional services are commonly referred to as white-glove services. We use our proprietary technology platform to collect customer feedback, monitor carrier performance, manage capacity and encourage communication to protect the brands of the retailers, e-tailers and manufacturers we serve.

Less-Than-Truckload (LTL)
In North America, our LTL operations are asset-based. We employ professional drivers, own a leading fleet of tractors and trailers for line-haul, pickup and delivery, and have a large network of terminals. We provide our customers with critical density and day-definite regional, inter-regional and transcontinental LTL freight services. As of December 31, 2018, XPO was a top three provider of LTL services in North America, offering more than 75,000 next-day and two-day lanes. Our coverage area in North America encompasses approximately 99% of all U.S. zip codes, with service within Canada, and cross-border with Mexico and Canada.
In Europe, our LTL operations utilize a blend of asset-based and asset-light capacity — both Company fleet and contracted carriers, with a network of terminals. We provide LTL services domestically in France, the United Kingdom and Spain. We also offer multinational LTL distribution throughout Europe.
Full Truckload
Our asset-based full truckload services operate almost entirely in Europe. For many customers, we function as a dedicated contract carrier, providing truckload capacity by utilizing our fleet of tractors and trailers, and our drivers. In addition, we provide transactional transportation of packaged goods, high cube products and bulk goods. We provide full truckload services domestically in France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Romania, Italy, Portugal and Slovakia, and internationally throughout Europe. As of December 31, 2018, XPO was a leading provider of full truckload transportation in Europe.
Global Forwarding
Our global forwarding operations are asset-light; we provide logistics services for domestic, cross-border and international shipments through our relationships with ground, air and ocean carriers and a network of Company and agent-owned offices. Our freight forwarding capabilities are not restricted by size, weight, mode or location, and therefore are potentially attractive to a wide market base.
As part of our global forwarding network, we operate subsidiaries as non-vessel-operating common carriers (“NVOCC”) to transport our customers’ freight by contracting with vessel operators. We are also a customs broker licensed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service. This enables us to provide customs brokerage services to direct domestic importers, other freight forwarders and NVOCCs, and vessel-operating common carriers.
Managed Transportation
The Company is a top five global provider of managed transportation based on the value of freight under management. Our managed transportation offering includes a range of services provided to shippers who want to outsource some or all of their transportation modes, together with associated activities. These activities can include freight handling, such as consolidation and deconsolidation, labor planning, the facilitation of inbound and outbound shipments, cross-border customs management and documentation, claims processing, and third-party logistics supplier management, as well as other services. We categorize our managed transportation services as control tower solutions, managed expedite and dedicated capacity.
Logistics Services
Our Logistics segment, which we also refer to as Supply Chain, encompasses a range of services for the purpose of helping our customers control costs and increase efficiency. We provide differentiated and data-intensive contract logistics services for customers, including value-added warehousing and distribution, e-commerce fulfillment, cold chain solutions, reverse logistics, packaging and labeling, factory support, aftermarket support, inventory management and personalization services, such as laser etching. In addition, our Logistics segment provides highly engineered, customized solutions and supply chain optimization services, such as volume flow management, predictive analytics and advanced automation. Our Logistics operations are led by seasoned executives in North America and Europe who collaborate on multinational opportunities. As of December 31, 2018, XPO was the second largest global provider of contract logistics based on facility space, with one of the largest e-fulfillment platforms in Europe.
We utilize our technology and expertise to solve complex supply chain challenges and create transformative solutions for our customers. Examples include intelligent robots that support our warehouse employees, and 
8

sophisticated analytics for demand forecasting. Our proprietary algorithms can predict the flow of goods and future returns, helping our e-commerce customers plan for peak inventory, capacity and labor levels. 
Our logistics customers primarily operate in industries with high-growth outsourcing opportunities, such as retail and e-commerce, food and beverage, technology, aerospace, wireless, industrial and manufacturing, chemical, agribusiness, life sciences and healthcare. They have demanding requirements for quality standards, real-time data visibility, special handling, security, the management of large numbers of stock-keeping units, time-assured deliveries and management of seasonal surges in certain sectors, such as retail and e-commerce.
XPO Direct
XPO Direct is a shared-space distribution network that capitalizes on the strengths of our Logistics and Transportation segments in combination. This network of logistics warehouses and last mile hubs gives our customers flexible capacity and helps them speed order fulfillment and delivery. Our facilities serve as stockholding sites and cross-docks that can be utilized by multiple customers at the same time. Transportation needs are supported by our brokered, contracted and owned capacity. 
XPO Direct gives companies a way to manage Business-to-Consumer and Business-to-Business fulfillment using our scale and capacity, without the capital investment of adding high-fixed-cost distribution centers. Our North American footprint positions goods within one-day and two-day ground transportation range of approximately 90% of the U.S. population and in close proximity to retail stores for inventory replenishment.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to help customers manage their goods most efficiently through their supply chains, using our highly integrated network of people, technology and physical assets. We deliver value to customers in the form of process efficiencies, cost efficiencies, reliable outcomes, technological innovations and service that is both highly responsive and proactive.
As part of our strategy, we continuously seek to become more efficient in our own operations. We do this by looking for ways to leverage our strengths and serve customers as comprehensively as possible — our existing customers, and also companies in high-growth verticals where there is a need for multiple XPO services. As of December 31, 2018, 90 of our top 100 customers were using two or more of our service lines.
In addition, we have a comprehensive framework of processes for recruiting, training and mentoring our employees, and for marketing to the hundreds of thousands of prospective customers that can use our services. Most important to our growth, we have instilled a culture of collaboration that focuses our efforts on delivering results for our customers and our Company.
We will continue to grow the business in a disciplined manner, and with a compelling value proposition: XPO can provide innovative solutions for any company, of any size, with any combination of supply chain needs.

Technology and Intellectual Property
One of the ways in which we empower our employees to deliver superior service is through our proprietary technology. We believe that technology is a compelling differentiator in our industry. It represents one of the Company’s largest categories of investment, reflecting our belief that the continual enhancement of our technology is critical to our success.
In 2018, we introduced numerous innovations, some of which are described here:
In our Logistics segment, we launched our proprietary, cloud-based warehouse management platform to integrate robotics and other advanced automation very rapidly into our operations. This is particularly advantageous in multi-site and multichannel environments. Our technology facilitates omnichannel distribution, lean manufacturing support, aftermarket support, supply chain optimization and transportation management. It links our XPO Direct distribution network and can predict where stock should be positioned in the network for the greatest efficiency.
We announced a partnership with a world leader in consumer packaged goods to co-create a 638,000-square-foot logistics center in the U.K. The site is scheduled to open in 2020 and will feature advanced sortation systems and robotics, as well as other state-of-the-art automation and an XPO technology laboratory. A digital ecosystem will integrate predictive data and intelligent machines, operating as both a think tank and a launch pad for our innovations.
We’re deploying 5,000 additional robots throughout our logistics sites in North America and Europe. These are intelligent robots that collaborate with humans; the solution is designed to supplement our existing workforce and support future growth. These robots shorten order-to-shipment times, support same-day and next-day deliveries and help workers minimize walk-time and manual errors. As a separate initiative, we are using data-driven workforce planning tools in our warehouses to optimize productivity shift by shift.
In our Transportation segment, our XPO Connect digital freight marketplace operates as a fully automated, self-learning platform that connects shippers with carriers, both directly and through the Company. This technology gives customers direct access to our carrier transportation network and its predictive data, while carriers connect through our Drive XPO mobile app. As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 14,000 carrier signups for XPO Connect access.
In last mile, our technology delivers a consistent consumer experience with superior satisfaction levels. The system gathers real-time feedback post-delivery to help our customers build loyalty. This protects the brands of our e-tail 
10

and retail customers. We also use our proprietary applications to engage consumers in the delivery process for their heavy goods. Shoppers who buy large items from our customers online can track those orders in real time using our web portal, Google Home, Amazon Echo or Google Search. They can request personalized alerts, reschedule delivery times electronically and use our augmented reality tool to visualize the item inside their home.
In LTL, we launched a next-generation web integration that gives shippers access to more capabilities without custom programming, including delivery and pickup management tools, pricing and planning tools, and electronic document handling. We also developed proposal and pricing systems for LTL, with robust algorithms and profitability monitoring. Overall, we have improved the business intelligence we use internally for LTL pricing, workforce planning and network optimization.
The supply chain industry is wide open for disruptive thinking like this. Our position as a technology leader has led to important new advantages for our customers.
Customers and Markets
Our Company provides services to a variety of customers, ranging in size from small, entrepreneurial organizations to Fortune 500 companies and global leaders. We have a diversified base of more than 50,000 customers that minimizes our concentration risk: in 2018, approximately 11% of our revenue was attributable to our top five customers.
In addition, our markets are highly diversified. The customers we serve span every major industry and touch every part of the economy. Our revenue derives from a mix of key verticals, such as retail and e-commerce, food and beverage, consumer packaged goods and industrial.
Our transportation services are primarily marketed in North America and Europe, whereas our logistics and global forwarding networks serve global markets with concentrations in North America, Europe and Asia. For the full year 2018, approximately 59% of our revenue was generated in the United States, 13% came from France and 12% from the United Kingdom.
Competition
Transportation and logistics are highly competitive and fragmented marketplaces, with thousands of companies competing domestically and internationally. XPO competes on service, reliability, scope and scale of operations, technological capabilities and price. Our competitors include local, regional, national and international companies that offer the same services we provide — some with larger customer bases, significantly more resources and more experience than we have. Additionally, some of our customers have internal resources that can perform services we offer. Due in part to the fragmented nature of the industry, we must strive daily to retain existing business relationships and forge new relationships.
The health of the transportation and logistics industry will continue to be a function of domestic and global economic growth. However, we believe that we have positioned the Company in fast-growing sectors to benefit from secular trends in demand, such as e-commerce and outsourcing. Together with our scale, technology and company-specific initiatives, we believe that our positioning should keep us growing faster than the macro environment.
Regulation
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies in the United States and in the other countries where we conduct business. These regulations impact us directly and indirectly by regulating third-party transportation providers we use to transport freight for our customers.
Regulation Affecting Motor Carriers, Owner-Operators and Transportation Brokers. In the United States, our subsidiaries that operate as motor carriers have motor carrier licenses issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). In addition, our subsidiaries acting as property brokers have property broker licenses issued by the FMCSA. Our motor carrier subsidiaries and the third-party motor carriers we engage in the United States must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those related to drug-testing, alcohol-testing, hours-of-service, records retention, vehicle inspection, driver qualification and minimum insurance requirements. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to 
11

government regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to emissions, drivers’ hours-of-service, independent contractor eligibility requirements, onboard reporting of operations, air cargo security and other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the California Air Resources Board and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), also regulate our equipment, operations and independent contractor drivers. Like our third-party support carriers, we are subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements in certain states and local jurisdictions where we operate. In foreign jurisdictions where we operate, our operations are regulated by the appropriate governmental authorities.
In 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance Safety Accountability program (“CSA”), which uses a Safety Management System (“SMS”) to rank motor carriers on seven categories of safety-related data, known as Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories, or “BASICs.”
Although the CSA scores are not currently publicly available, this development is likely to be temporary. As a result, our fleet could be ranked worse or better than our competitors, and the safety ratings of our motor carrier operations could be impacted. Our network of third-party transportation providers may experience a similar result. A reduction in safety and fitness ratings may result in difficulty attracting and retaining qualified independent contractors and could cause our customers to direct their business away from XPO and to carriers with more favorable CSA scores, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
In addition, nearly all carriers and drivers that are required to maintain records of duty status, including certain of XPO’s motor carrier subsidiaries and drivers, have been required to install and use electronic logging devices (“ELDs”). ELD installation and use may increase costs for independent contractors and other third-party support carriers who provide services to XPO and may impact driver recruitment.
Regulations Affecting our Subsidiaries Providing Ocean and Air Transportation. XPO Customs Clearance Solutions, LLC (“XCCS”) and XPO GF America, Inc. (“XGFA”), two of the Company’s subsidiaries, are licensed as U.S. Customs brokers by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“the CBP”) of the DHS in each U.S. district where they perform services. All U.S. Customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the CBP. In other jurisdictions where we perform customs brokerage services, our operations are licensed, where necessary, by the appropriate governmental authority.
Our subsidiaries offering expedited air charter transportation are subject to regulation by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) of the DHS regarding air cargo security for all loads, regardless of origin and destination. XPO Global Forwarding, Inc. (“XGF”), XGFA and XPO Air Charter, LLC are regulated as “indirect air carriers” by the DHS and the TSA. These agencies provide requirements, guidance and, in some cases, administer licensing requirements and processes applicable to the freight forwarding industry.
Regarding our international operations, XGF and XGFA are members of the International Air Transportation Association (“IATA”), a voluntary association of airlines and freight forwarders that outlines operating procedures for forwarders acting as agents or third-party intermediaries for IATA members. A substantial portion of XPO’s international air freight business is transacted with other IATA members.
Additionally, XGF, XGFA and XCCS are each registered as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary (“OTI”) and ocean freight forwarders by the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”), which establishes the qualifications, regulations and bonding requirements to operate as an OTI and ocean freight forwarder for businesses originating and terminating in the United States. XGF and XGFA are also licensed NVOCCs.
Our international freight forwarding operations make us subject to regulations of the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Treasury, and to various laws and regulations of the other countries where we operate. These regulations cover matters, such as what commodities may be shipped to what destinations and to what end-users, unfair international trade practices, and limitations on entities with which we may conduct business.
Other Regulations. The Company is subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption statutes.
Classification of Independent Contractors. Tax and other federal and state regulatory authorities, as well as private litigants, continue to assert that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than 
12

independent contractors. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements and heighten the penalties for companies who misclassify workers and are found to have violated overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers that meet certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a longstanding, recognized practice. Federal legislators also sought to expand the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover “non-employees” who perform labor or services for businesses, even if said non-employees are properly classified as independent contractors; require taxpayers to provide written notice to workers based upon their classification as either an employee or a non-employee; and impose penalties and fines for violations of the notice requirement and/or for misclassifications. Some states have launched initiatives to increase revenues from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation and income taxes, and the reclassification of independent contractors as employees could help states with those initiatives. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determinations of independent contractor status. If XPO’s independent contractor drivers are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under some or all of the following: federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, and labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.
Environmental Regulations. Our facilities and operations and our independent contractors are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, emissions from vehicles, engine-idling, fuel tanks and related fuel spillage and seepage, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters that involve inherent environmental risks. Similar laws and regulations may apply in many of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We may be responsible for the cleanup of any spill or other incident involving hazardous materials caused by our operations or business. In the past, we have been responsible for the costs of cleanup of diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events, and none of these incidents materially affected our business or operations. We generally transport only hazardous materials rated as low-to-medium-risk, and a small percentage of our total shipments contains hazardous materials. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations and we do not know of any existing environmental condition that reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. Future changes in environmental regulations or liabilities from newly discovered environmental conditions or violations (and any associated fines and penalties) could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. U.S. federal and state governments, as well as governments in certain foreign jurisdictions where we operate, have also proposed environmental legislation that could, among other things, potentially limit carbon, exhaust and greenhouse gas emissions. If enacted, such legislation could result in higher costs for new tractors and trailers, reduced productivity and efficiency, and increased operating expenses, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Risk Management and Insurance
We maintain insurance for commercial automobile liability, truckers’ commercial automobile liability, commercial general liability, cargo/warehouse legal liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, and umbrella and excess umbrella liability, with coverage limits, deductibles and self-insured retention levels that we believe are reasonable given the varying historical frequency, severity and timing of claims. Certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments are made for insurance reserves and are subject to a degree of variability.
Seasonality
Our revenue and profitability are typically lower for the first quarter of the calendar year relative to the other quarters. We believe this is due in part to the post-holiday reduction in demand experienced by many of our customers, which leads to more capacity in the non-expedited and service-critical markets and, in turn, less demand for expedited and premium shipping services. In addition, the productivity of our tractors and trailers, independent contractors and transportation providers generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations. It is not possible to reliably predict whether the Company’s historical revenue and profitability trends will continue to occur in future periods.

Our employee base is one of our most critical resources, and we view the recruitment, training and retention of qualified employees as being essential to our ongoing success. We believe that we have good relations with our employees, with strong programs in place for communication and professional development.
