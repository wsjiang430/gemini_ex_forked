ITEM 1:     BUSINESS
​
Background
​
Winmark – the Resale Company® (Winmark Corporation, Winmark or the Company), is a nationally recognized franchisor focused on sustainability and small business formation. We champion and guide entrepreneurs interested in operating one of our award winning resale franchises: Plato’s Closet®, Once Upon A Child®, Play It Again Sports®, Style Encore® and Music Go Round®. At December 31, 2022, there were 1,295 franchises in operation in the United States and Canada and over 2,800 available territories. Our mission is to provide Resale for Everyone™. 
 ​
Each of our resale brands emphasizes consumer value by offering high-quality used merchandise at substantial savings from the price of new merchandise and by purchasing customers’ used goods that have been outgrown or are no longer used. Our concepts also offer a limited amount of new merchandise to customers. For over 30 years, we have offered a sustainable solution for consumers to recycle their gently used clothing, toys, sporting goods and musical instruments. We estimate that, since 2010 stores in our resale brands have extended the lives of over one and a half billion items. We continue to enhance our franchise model and provide our franchisees with the technology, tools and training to profitably expand their operations and evolve towards being a multi-channel retailer.
 ​
During 2021, we made the decision to no longer solicit new leasing customers and pursue an orderly run-off of our equipment leasing portfolio in our wholly owned subsidiary, Winmark Capital Corporation.
​
Our significant assets are located within the United States, and we generate the majority of revenues from United States operations. Revenues from Canadian franchisees in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $6.4 million, $4.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively. For additional financial information, please see Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We were incorporated in Minnesota in 1988.
​



COVID-19
​
COVID-19 has had an unprecedented impact on the retail industry in general, and our franchised retail stores have experienced the resulting imposition of temporary store closures to in-store consumer activities, reduced customer traffic, implementation of new cleaning and safety standards, and pivoting to find new ways to help consumers buy and sell merchandise in our concepts. As a result, our system-wide sales and royalty revenues were impacted, most notably in 2020, as reflected in the tables below.
​
For further information about COVID-19’s impact to our business, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
​
Operations
​
Our retail brands are summarized as follows: 
​
Plato’s Closet
​
We began franchising the Plato’s Closet brand in 1999. Plato’s Closet franchisees buy and sell gently used clothing and accessories geared toward the teenage and young adult market. Customers have the opportunity to sell their used items to Plato’s Closet stores and to purchase quality used clothing and accessories at prices lower than new merchandise.
​
Once Upon A Child
​
We began franchising the Once Upon A Child brand in 1993. Once Upon A Child franchisees buy and sell gently used and, to a lesser extent, new children’s clothing, toys, furniture, equipment and accessories. This brand primarily targets parents of children ages infant to 12 years. These customers have the opportunity to sell their used children’s items to a Once Upon A Child store when outgrown and to purchase quality used children’s clothing, toys, furniture and equipment at prices lower than new merchandise.
​
Play It Again Sports
​
We began franchising the Play It Again Sports brand in 1988. Play It Again Sports franchisees buy, sell and trade gently used and new sporting goods, equipment and accessories for a variety of athletic activities including team sports (baseball/softball, hockey, football, lacrosse, soccer), fitness, ski/snowboard and golf among others. The stores offer a flexible mix of merchandise that is adjusted to adapt to seasonal and regional differences.
​
Style Encore
​
We began franchising the Style Encore brand in 2013. Style Encore franchisees buy and sell gently used women’s (and to a lesser extent, men’s) apparel, shoes and accessories. Customers have the opportunity to sell their used items to Style Encore stores and to purchase quality used clothing, shoes and accessories at prices lower than new merchandise.
​
Music Go Round
​
We began franchising the Music Go Round brand in 1994. Music Go Round franchisees buy, sell and trade gently used and, to a lesser extent, new musical instruments, speakers, amplifiers, music-related electronics and related accessories.
​
The following table presents system-wide sales, which we define as estimated revenues generated by all franchise locations through both in-store and e-commerce sales, for each of the past three years.

​
​



We have developed an e-commerce platform that allows franchisees of our Music Go Round, Play It Again Sports and Style Encore brands to market and sell in-store product inventory online. Consumers that visit musicgoround.com, playitagainsports.com or style-encore.com can find all product listed by participating stores in one convenient location. All product listings are available for in-store pickup, and certain products may be available for shipment. Our e-commerce platform assists our franchisees in marketing, increasing brand awareness, and driving consumers to local stores, which provides further opportunities for our stores to purchase product from consumers. Additionally, our franchisees use other vehicles to drive non-store sales including social media platforms (Facebook and Instagram) as well as third-party marketplaces (including Shopify and eBay).
​
The following table presents the royalties and franchise fees contributed by each of our brands for the past three years and the corresponding percentage of consolidated revenues for each such year:

​
Sustainability
​
As a leader in the circular economy, we have been at the forefront of the sustainability movement for over 30 years. Our franchise brands offer customers a better way to keep their clothes, sporting goods and music equipment out of landfills and in use for a fuller, longer product lifespan. In 2022 alone, stores across our five resale brands purchased over 178 million items of clothing, toys, books, musical instruments and sports equipment. Our high-quality franchised stores give consumers an easier way to buy and sell used goods within their local communities without placing demands on wasteful production. In turn, this means less water and energy consumption, giving consumers a way to help cut down on pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
​
Franchising Business Model
​
We use franchising as a business method of distributing goods and services through our retail brands to consumers. We, as franchisor, own a retail business brand, represented by a service mark or similar right, and an operating system for the franchised business. We then enter into franchise agreements with franchisees and grant the franchisee the right to use our business brand, service marks and operating system to manage a retail business. Franchisees are required to operate their retail businesses according to the systems, specifications, standards and formats we develop for the business brand. We train the franchisees how to operate the franchised business. We also provide continuing support and service to our franchisees.



We have developed value-oriented retail brands based on a mix of gently used and, to a lesser extent, new merchandise. We franchise rights to franchisees who open franchised locations under such brands. The key elements of our franchise strategy include:
​

● | franchising the rights to operate retail stores offering value-oriented merchandise;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | attracting new, qualified franchisees; and
--+-------------------------------------------


● | providing initial and continuing support to franchisees.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

Offering Value-Oriented Merchandise
​
Our retail brands provide value to consumers by purchasing and reselling gently used merchandise that consumers have outgrown or no longer use at substantial savings from the price of new merchandise. By offering a combination of high-quality used and value-priced new merchandise, we benefit from consumer demand for value-oriented retailing. In addition, we believe that among national retail operations our brands provide a unique source of value to consumers by purchasing used merchandise. We also believe that the strategy of buying used merchandise increases consumer awareness of our retail brands.
​
Franchisee Qualification
​
We seek to attract prospective franchisees with experience in management and operations and an interest in being the owner and operator of their own business. We seek franchisees who:
​

● | have a sufficient net worth;
--+-----------------------------


● | have prior business experience; and
--+------------------------------------


● | intend to be integrally involved with the management of the business.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

​
At December 31, 2022, we had 57 signed franchise agreements, of which the majority are expected to open in 2023.
​
Franchise Support
​
As a franchisor, our success depends upon our ability to develop and support competitive and successful franchise owners. We emphasize the following areas of franchise support and assistance.
​
Training
​
Each franchisee must attend our training program regardless of prior experience. Soon after signing a franchise agreement, the franchisee is required to attend new owner orientation training. This course covers basic management issues, such as preparing a business plan, lease evaluation, evaluating insurance needs and obtaining financing. Our training staff assists each franchisee in developing a business plan for their retail store with financial and cash flow projections. The second training session is centered on store operations. It covers, among other things, point-of-sale computer training, inventory selection and acquisition, sales, marketing and other topics. We provide the franchisee with operations manuals that we periodically update.
​
Operations Support
​
We provide operational support and guidance to assist the franchisee in the opening of a new business. We also have an ongoing support program designed to assist franchisees in operating their retail stores. Our franchise support personnel visit each store periodically (in person or virtually) and, in most cases, a business assessment is made to determine whether the franchisee is operating in accordance with our standards. The visit is also designed to assist franchisees with operational issues.
​
Purchasing
​
During training each franchisee is taught how to evaluate, purchase and price used goods directly from customers. We have developed specialized computer point-of-sale systems for our brands that provide the franchisee with standardized pricing information to assist in the purchasing of used items.
​



We provide centralized buying services, which on a limited basis include credit and billing for the Play It Again Sports franchisees. Our Play It Again Sports franchise system uses several major vendors for new product including Nautilus, Wilson Sporting Goods, Champro Sports, Rawlings/Easton, CCM Hockey and Bauer Hockey. The loss of any of the above vendors would change the vendor mix, but not significantly change our products offered.
​
To provide the franchisees of our Play It Again Sports, Once Upon A Child and Music Go Round systems a source of affordable new product, we have developed relationships with our significant vendors and negotiated prices for our franchisees to take advantage of the buying power a franchise system brings.
​
Our typical Once Upon A Child franchised store purchases approximately 30% of its new product from Rachel’s Ribbons, Wild Side Accessories, Melissa & Doug and Nuby. The loss of any of the above vendors would change the vendor mix, but not significantly change our products offered.
​
Our typical Music Go Round franchised store purchases approximately 50% of its new product from KMC/Musicorp, RapcoHorizon Company, D’Addario, GHS Corporation and Ernie Ball. The loss of any of the above vendors would change the vendor mix, but not significantly change our products offered.
​
There are no significant vendors of new products to our typical Plato’s Closet and Style Encore franchised stores as new product is an extremely low percentage of sales for these brands.
​
Retail Advertising and Marketing
​
We encourage our franchisees to implement a marketing program that includes the following: television, radio, point-of-purchase materials, in-store signage and local store marketing programs as well as email marketing promotions, website promotions and participation in social and digital media. Franchisees of the respective brands are required to spend a minimum of 5% of their gross sales on approved advertising and marketing. Franchisees may be required to participate in regional cooperative advertising groups.
​
Computerized Point-Of-Sale Systems
​
We require our franchisees to use a retail information management computer system in each store, which has evolved with the development of new technology. This computerized point-of-sale system is designed specifically for use in our franchise retail stores. The current system includes our proprietary Data Recycling System software, a dedicated server, two or more work station registers with touch screen monitors, receipt printers, label printers and bar code scanners, together with software modules for inventory management, cash management and customer information management. Our franchisees purchase the computer hardware from us. The Data Recycling System software is designed to accommodate buying of used merchandise. This system provides franchisees with an important management tool that reduces errors, increases efficiencies and enhances inventory control. We provide point-of-sale system support through our Computer Support Center located at our Company headquarters.
​
The Franchise Agreement
​
We enter into franchise agreements with our franchisees. The following is a summary of certain key provisions of our current standard brand franchise agreement. Except as noted, the franchise agreements used for each of our brands, whether for locations in the United States or Canada, are generally the same.
​
Each franchisee must execute our franchise agreement and pay an initial franchise fee. At December 31, 2022, the franchise fee for all brands was $25,000 for an initial store in the U.S. and $32,000CAD for an initial store in Canada. Once a franchisee opens its initial store, it can open additional stores, in any brand, by paying a $15,000 franchise fee for a store in the U.S. and $19,200CAD for a store in Canada, provided an acceptable territory is available and the franchisee meets the brand’s additional store standards. The franchise fee for our initial store and additional store in Canada is based upon the exchange rate applied to the United States franchise fee on the last business day of the preceding fiscal year. The franchise fee in March 2023 for an initial store in Canada will be $34,000CAD, and an additional store in Canada will be $20,500CAD. Typically, the franchisee’s initial store is open for business approximately 10 to 14 months from the date the franchise agreement is signed. The franchise agreement has an initial term of 10 years, with subsequent 10-year renewal periods, and grants the franchisee an exclusive geographic area, which will vary in size depending upon population, demographics and other factors. Under current franchise agreements, franchisees of the respective brands are required to pay us weekly continuing fees (royalties) equal to the percentage of gross sales outlined in their Franchise Agreements, generally ranging from 4% to 5% for all of our brands.



Each Franchisee is currently required to pay us an annual marketing fee of $1,500, and is required to spend 5% of its gross sales for advertising and promoting its franchised store. We have the option to increase the minimum advertising expenditure requirement from 5% to 6% of the franchisee’s gross sales, of which up to 2% would be paid to us as an advertising fee for deposit into an advertising fund. This fund, if initiated, would be managed by us and would be used for advertising and promotion of the franchise system.
​
During the term of a franchise agreement, franchisees agree not to operate directly or indirectly any competitive business. In addition, franchisees agree that after the end of the term or termination of the franchise agreement, franchisees will not operate any competitive business for a period of two years and within a reasonable geographic area.
​
Although our franchise agreements contain provisions designed to assure the quality of a franchisee’s operations, we have less control over a franchisee’s operations than we would if we owned and operated a retail store. Under the franchise agreement, we have a right of first refusal on the sale of any franchised store, but we are not obligated to repurchase any franchised store.
​
Renewal of the Franchise Relationship
​
At the end of the 10-year term of each franchise agreement, each franchisee has the option to “renew” the franchise relationship by signing a new 10-year franchise agreement. If a franchisee chooses not to sign a new franchise agreement, a franchisee must comply with all post termination obligations including the franchisee’s noncompetition clause discussed above. We may choose not to renew the franchise relationship only when permitted by the franchise agreement and applicable state law.
​
We believe that renewing a significant number of these franchise relationships is important to the success of the Company. During the past three years, we renewed 99% of franchise agreements up for renewal.
​
Competition
​
Retailing, including the sale of apparel, sporting goods and musical instruments, is highly competitive. Many retailers have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Our franchisees compete with established, locally owned retail stores, discount chains and traditional retail stores for sales of new merchandise. Full line retailers generally carry little or no used merchandise. Resale, thrift and consignment shops and garage and rummage sales offer competition to our franchisees for the sale of used merchandise. Also, our franchisees increasingly compete with online used and new goods marketplaces such as eBay, craigslist, facebook Marketplace, Poshmark, thredUP, Amazon and many others.
​
Our Plato’s Closet franchise stores primarily compete with specialty apparel stores such as American Eagle, Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Old Navy, Hollister and Forever 21. We compete with other franchisors in the teenage resale clothing retail market.
​
Our Once Upon A Child franchisees compete primarily with large retailers such as Walmart, Target and various specialty children’s retail stores such as Carter’s and Gap Kids. We compete with other franchisors in the specialty children’s resale retail market.
​
Our Play It Again Sports franchisees compete with large retailers such as Dick’s Sporting Goods, Academy Sports & Outdoors as well as regional and local sporting goods stores. We also compete with Target and Walmart.
​
Our Style Encore franchise stores compete with a wide range of women’s apparel stores. We also compete with other franchisors in the women’s resale clothing retail market.
​
Our Music Go Round franchise stores compete with large musical instrument retailers such as Guitar Center as well as local independent musical instrument stores.
​
Our franchises may face additional competition in the future. This could include additional competitors that may enter the used merchandise market. We believe that our franchisees will continue to be able to compete with other retailers based on the strength of our value-oriented brands and the name recognition associated with our service marks.
​



We also face competition in connection with the sale of franchises. Our prospective franchisees frequently evaluate other franchise opportunities before purchasing a franchise from us. We compete with other franchise companies for franchisees based on the following factors, among others: amount of initial investment, franchise fee, royalty rate, profitability, franchisor services and industry. We believe that our franchise brands are competitive with other franchises based on the fees we charge, our franchise support services and the performance of our existing franchise brands.
​
Equipment Leasing Operations
​
Our leasing business historically consisted of a small-ticket financing business operated through Wirth Business Credit, Inc., and a middle-market leasing business through Winmark Capital Corporation, both of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries.
​
Our small-ticket financing business was operated from 2004 to 2020. In August 2020, we made the decision to no longer originate financing transactions in this business, and we sold the remaining small-ticket portfolio at the end of November 2020 for its approximate carrying value of $0.7 million. The operations of this business were not material to the financial results of our leasing segment during the past three years.
​
Our middle-market leasing business began operations in 2004. In May 2021, we made the decision to no longer solicit new leasing customers and pursue an orderly run-off of this leasing portfolio. Given this decision, we anticipate that leasing revenues, expenses, contribution and cash flows will continue to decrease throughout the run-off period. For additional information on our leasing business, please see Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
 ​
Government Regulation
​
Fourteen states, the Federal Trade Commission and six Canadian Provinces impose pre-sale franchise registration and/or disclosure requirements on franchisors. In addition, a number of states have statutes which regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship such as termination, nonrenewal, transfer, discrimination among franchisees and competition with franchisees.
​
Additional legislation, both at the federal and state levels, could expand pre-sale disclosure requirements, further regulate substantive aspects of the franchise relationship and require us to file our Franchise Disclosure Documents with additional states. We cannot predict the effect of future franchise legislation, but do not believe there is any imminent legislation currently under consideration which would have a material adverse impact on our operations.
​
We believe that we are currently in compliance with all material statutes and regulations that are applicable to our business. We do not currently incur any material costs or effects of compliance with the environmental laws (federal, state and local).
​
Trademarks and Service Marks
​
We have various trademark registrations and pending trademark applications for registration, including Plato’s Closet®, Once Upon A Child®, Play It Again Sports®, Style Encore®, Music Go Round®, Winmark®, Winmark – the Resale Company®, and Resale for Everyone™, among others. These marks are of considerable value to our business. We intend to protect our service marks by appropriate legal action where and when necessary. Each service mark registration must be renewed every 10 years. We have taken, and intend to continue to take, all steps necessary to renew the registration of all our material service marks.
​
Seasonality
​
Our Plato’s Closet and Once Upon A Child franchise brands have experienced higher than average sales volumes during the spring months and during the back-to-school season. Our Play It Again Sports franchise brand has experienced higher than average sales volumes during the winter season. Overall, the different seasonal trends of our brands partially offset each other and do not result in significant seasonality trends on a Company-wide basis. 
​
Human Capital Resources
Human capital resources are an integral and essential component of our business.  As of December 31, 2022, we employed 83 employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Our franchisees are independent business owners, therefore, they and their employees are not included in our employee count and are not employees of Winmark Corporation.
​
Our employees are our most valuable resource. We recognize that employee development is a critical element of maintaining an engaged and inclusive work environment. Investing in our employees supports employee retention, morale and enhances the quality of work. We provide mentorship opportunities, leadership succession planning and encourage promoting from within to further strengthen our commitment to each employee. Our compensation programs are designed to support not only the financial, but the physical and mental well-being of our employees.  In addition to our competitive salaries, our programs include, among other things, robust health and welfare benefits, a 401(k) plan with matching contribution, profit-sharing, generous paid leave policies, and an employee assistance program. We have in the past and will continue to place a strong emphasis on our employee’s welfare, health, and safety.
​
We recognize the benefits of and are committed to a culture of diversity and inclusion, where each individual is valued for their own unique perspective and experiences.  Approximately 50% of our overall employee count and approximately 50% of our management team identify as female. Additionally, we provide training to our management team and employees regarding diversity and inclusion and we continue to actively work to increase representation among underrepresented demographic groups within our employee base.
