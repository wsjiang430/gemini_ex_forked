 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview
 Theravance Biopharma, Inc. ("Theravance Biopharma") is a diversified biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of organ-selective medicines. Our purpose is to create transformational medicines to improve the lives of patients suffering from serious illnesses. Our research is focused in the areas of inflammation and immunology.
     In pursuit of our purpose, we apply insights and innovation at each stage of our business and utilize our internal capabilities and those of partners around the world. We apply organ-selective expertise to biologically compelling targets to discover and develop medicines designed to treat underserved localized diseases and to limit systemic exposure, in order to maximize patient benefit and minimize risk. These efforts leverage years of experience in developing lung-selective medicines to treat respiratory disease, including US Food and Drug Administration-approved YUPELRITM (revefenacin) inhalation solution indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”). Our pipeline of internally discovered programs is targeted to address significant patient needs.
    
We have an economic interest in potential future payments from Glaxo Group or one of its affiliates (“GSK”) pursuant to its agreements with Innoviva, Inc. (“Innoviva”) relating to certain programs, including TRELEGY ELLIPTA.
     2018 Highlights
 In 2018, we accomplished a number of key corporate goals. As our programs advanced through various stages of development, clinical results further informed our focus on strategic priorities and our plans towards creating transformational medicines to help improve the lives of patients. 
     FDA Approval of YUPELRI
 We announced US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval of YUPELRITM (revefenacin) inhalation solution for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD. YUPELRI, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, is the first and only once-daily, nebulized bronchodilator approved for the treatment of COPD in the US. Additionally, we completed a Phase 3b study of YUPELRI in patients with suboptimal peak inspiratory flow rate, which showed encouraging findings in the pre-specified subgroup of severe and very severe COPD patients. Commercial launch is underway with our partner Mylan.
     TD-1473 Co-Development and Commercialization Agreement
 We announced a global co-development and commercialization agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc., for our gut-selective JAK inhibitor TD-1473 and related back-up compounds for inflammatory intestinal diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We subsequently completed the remaining two cohorts of the Phase 1b study of TD-1473 in ulcerative colitis. Results from this study provided the basis to advance TD-1473 into a larger Phase 2b/3 adaptive design induction and maintenance study in ulcerative colitis patients and a Phase 2 induction study in Crohn’s disease. Following completion of the Phase 1b study, we completed discussions with US and European Union (“EU”) regulators and gained agreement on the Phase 2b/3 study design in ulcerative colitis. 
     Positive Phase 2 Data for Ampreloxetine
 We reported positive top-line four-week data from the Phase 2 study of ampreloxetine (TD-9855), our norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (“NRI”) in development for the treatment of patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (“nOH”). Data collected in the study provided the basis to advance ampreloxetine into a registrational Phase 3 program in symptomatic nOH, for which we also gained FDA agreement on program design in 2018.

 Sale of VIBATIV
  In order to sharpen our focus on our most important programs outside of the anti-infectives market, we announced and closed the sale of VIBATIV® to Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company. 
     Economic Interest in GSK-Partnered Respiratory Programs and Issuance of $250.0 million in Aggregate Principal Amount of 9.0% Non-Recourse Notes
 Multiple milestones were achieved in 2018 with TRELEGY ELLIPTA, a respiratory program managed by GSK and Innoviva in which we have an economic interest that effectively entitles us to receive an upward tiering royalty of approximately 5.5% to 8.5% of worldwide net sales of TRELEGY ELLIPTA. Over the course of the year, GSK announced expanded COPD indications for TRELEGY ELLIPTA in both the US and EU, based on submissions to regulatory authorities supported by data from its IMPACT study. Results from the IMPACT study were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Outside the US and EU, GSK announced TRELEGY ELLIPTA regulatory applications submitted in additional markets including China and Japan. 
     We announced the closing of a private placement of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.0% non-recourse notes, secured by a portion of the future payments we receive related to royalties due on net sales of TRELEGY ELLIPTA. In order to comply with Regulation RR – Credit Risk Retention (17 C.F.R. Part 246), 5% of the principal amount of these notes were retained by Theravance Biopharma R&D, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Theravance Biopharma. Excluding the $12.5 million of retained notes and other fees related to the transaction, net proceeds of the offering were approximately $229.4 million. 
     Hosted an Investor Event to Highlight Our Research Projects (“R&D Day”)
 We also described at our R&D Day event our innovative research and development strategy of organ-selective medicines designed to expand the therapeutic index compared to conventional systemic therapies. We introduced several new research programs, each specifically tailored for the organ of interest. We progressed TD-8236, our novel, lung-selective inhaled JAK inhibitor, into a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and asthma patients.      Our Programs

     Program Highlights
 Gut-selective Pan-Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitor Program (TD-1473) 
 JAK inhibitors function by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the Janus kinase family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2) that play a key role in cytokine signaling. Inhibiting these JAK enzymes interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. JAK inhibitors are currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, myelofibrosis, and ulcerative colitis and have demonstrated therapeutic benefit for patients with Crohn’s disease. However, these products are known to have side effects based on their systemic exposure. Our goal is to develop an orally administered, gut-selective pan-JAK inhibitor specifically designed to distribute adequately and predominantly to the tissues of the intestinal tract, treating inflammation in those tissues while minimizing systemic exposure. TD-1473 is our lead gut-selective pan-JAK inhibitor in development as a potential treatment for a range of inflammatory intestinal diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. TD-1473 is progressing into multiple clinical studies, as further described below.      Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose and Multiple Ascending Dose  Studies
 In June 2016, we completed a Phase 1 clinical study of TD-1473, an internally-discovered JAK inhibitor that has demonstrated a high affinity for each of the JAK family of enzymes. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending and multiple ascending doses of TD-1473 in healthy volunteers. A key secondary objective of the trial was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of TD-1473, including the determination of the amount of TD-1473 that entered systemic circulation following oral administration. Data from the study demonstrated TD-1473 to be generally well tolerated. Study results also demonstrated that systemic exposures of TD-1473 were low relative to that reported for tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor approved for the treatment ulcerative colitis. At steady state, the plasma exposures of TD-1473 were significantly lower than the plasma exposure of tofacitinib.
     Furthermore, subjects exhibited high stool concentrations of TD-1473, which were comparable to concentrations associated with efficacy in preclinical colitis models. Preclinical studies also demonstrated penetration of TD-1473 into the intestinal wall and membrane. Data generated from the study met our target pharmacokinetic profile and supported clinical progression of the compound.
     Previously announced findings from a preclinical model of colitis evaluating TD-1473 and tofacitinib demonstrated that both compounds significantly reduced disease activity scores. However, at doses providing similar preclinical efficacy, the systemic exposure of TD-1473 was much lower than that of tofacitinib and, in contrast to tofacitinib, TD-1473 did not reduce systemic immune cell counts. Also, we completed six and nine month toxicology studies of TD-1473 and demonstrated favorable safety margins in these studies, in support of the dose ranges planned in the Phase 3 registrational program. Based on these preclinical findings, we believe that TD-1473 represents a potential breakthrough approach to treating inflammatory intestinal diseases without the risk generally associated with systemically active therapies.

 Phase 1b Study
 In late 2016, we announced dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1b clinical study of TD-1473 in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The Phase 1b exploratory study in 40 patients was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (“PK”) of TD-1473 over a 28-day treatment period. In addition, the study incorporated biomarker analysis and clinical, endoscopic, and histologic assessments to evaluate biological effect.
     In August 2017, we announced encouraging data from the first cohort of patients in the Phase 1b study. Data from the first cohort demonstrated evidence of localized biological activity for TD-1473 after four weeks of treatment, based on a compilation of clinical, endoscopic, and biomarker assessments. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrated minimal systemic exposure, and there was no evidence of systemic immunosuppression. 
     In August 2018, we announced top-line results from all cohorts in the Phase 1b study of TD-1473 in ulcerative colitis. Full results were shared as an oral late-breaker presentation at the United European Gastroenterology Week (“UEGW”) in October 2018. Data from the Phase 1b study demonstrated that four weeks of TD-1473 treatment led to signals of biological activity and localized target engagement with low systemic exposures and no evidence of systemic immunosuppression or opportunistic infections in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. More specifically, rates of clinical response were higher on all active doses (20, 80, 270 mg) compared with placebo using both partial and total Mayo endpoints, with greatest effect seen at the 270 mg dose. Rectal bleeding scores improved above placebo at the 80 and 270 mg doses. Endoscopic improvements and mucosal healing were reported in all active arms, and none was reported in the placebo arm. Additionally, plasma levels were low and consistent with data from healthy volunteers, and TD-1473 was generally well tolerated at all doses. 
     Based on positive results from the Phase 1b study and following dialogues with the FDA and European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) regarding study design, we began to initiate sites for the registrational Phase 2b/3 (RHEA) induction and maintenance study in ulcerative colitis. In addition, we announced first patient dosed in a Phase 2 (DIONE) induction study of TD-1473 in Crohn’s disease in late 2018.
     Janssen Biotech Collaboration
 In February 2018, we announced a global co-development and commercialization agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”) for TD-1473 and related back-up compounds for inflammatory intestinal diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $100.0 million and will be eligible to receive up to an additional $900.0 million in potential payments, inclusive of a potential opt-in payment following completion of the Phase 2 Crohn’s study and the Phase 2b induction portion of the ulcerative colitis study. At that time, Janssen can elect to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize TD-1473 and certain related compounds by paying us a fee of $200.0 million. Upon such election, we and Janssen will jointly develop and commercialize TD-1473 in inflammatory intestinal diseases, and we and Janssen will share profits and losses in the US and expenses related to a potential Phase 3 program (67% to Janssen; 33% to Theravance Biopharma). In addition, we would receive royalties on ex-US sales at double-digit tiered percentage royalty rates.
     The closing of the opt-in portion of the transaction is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (“HSR Act”). After Phase 2, Janssen would lead subsequent development of TD-1473 in Crohn’s disease if it makes such an election. We will lead development of TD-1473 in ulcerative colitis through completion of the Phase 2b/3 study. If TD-1473 is commercialized, we have the option to co-commercialize in the US, and Janssen would have sole commercialization responsibilities outside the US. 
     Ampreloxetine (TD‑9855)
 Ampreloxetine is an investigational, once-daily norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (“NRI”) being developed for the treatment of patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (“nOH”). nOH is caused by primary autonomic failure conditions, including multiple system atrophy, Parkinson’s disease and pure autonomic failure. The compound has high affinity for binding to norepinephrine transporters. By blocking the action of these transporters, ampreloxetine causes an increase in extracellular concentrations of norepinephrine.

 In May 2016, we initiated a Phase 2 study of ampreloxetine in nOH. The initial study design of the Phase 2 trial consisted of two parts. Part A, a single ascending dose study, with doses ranging from 1 mg up to 20 mg based on patient response, was designed to evaluate impact on blood pressure and standing time for ampreloxetine as compared to placebo. Part B, a double-blind, single dose study was designed to evaluate impact on blood pressure and standing time for ampreloxetine as compared to placebo. Based on encouraging treatment responses in the first part of the study, we amended the study design to allow responders to continue dosing for up to 20 weeks to assess the durability of their response (Part C). Part C, an open label extension to Part A, was designed to evaluate improvement in patients’ symptoms and impact on blood pressure. Responders in Part A were eligible to enroll in Part C at up to their highest tolerated Part A dose, which included 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg. The primary endpoint of the study was measured after four weeks, although patients can continue to receive medication for up to five months. We believe the ability to demonstrate a durable effect in nOH with ampreloxetine could lead to significant benefits for patients over existing therapy.
     In August 2018, we announced positive top-line four-week data from the Phase 2 trial of ampreloxetine for the treatment of nOH. Top-line results from the study included durable improvements in patients’ disease symptom severity after four weeks of treatment with ampreloxetine, as measured by Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment Question #1 (“OHSA #1”). OHSA #1 is a measure of dizziness, lightheadedness, or the sensation of being about to black out. Patients treated in the extension phase of the study showed a mean symptom improvement of 2.4 points at four weeks. Importantly, mean symptom improvement was greatest (3.8 points) in nOH patients who reported dizziness symptoms (OHSA #1 > 4) at baseline. Additionally, ampreloxetine consistently increased systolic blood pressure (“SBP”), including clinically meaningful increases in standing SBP at the three-minute assessment on all weekly clinic visits. Ampreloxetine was generally well tolerated, with no new safety findings attributable to drug observed in the study.  Based on positive top-line four-week results from the Phase 2 study and discussions with the FDA, we advanced ampreloxetine into a Phase 3 program. The Phase 3 program includes two studies. The first study is a four-week, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ampreloxetine in patients with symptomatic nOH. The second study is a randomized withdrawal study designed to evaluate the durability of patient response of ampreloxetine. We announced that we initiated patient dosing in each Phase 3 study in January and February 2019, respectively.
     In late February 2019, we announced emerging five-month data from the Phase 2 study further support previously-announced clinical observations after four weeks of treatment. Detailed study data will be submitted for presentation at a mid-2019 scientific meeting.
     YUPELRITM (revefenacin) Inhalation Solution
 YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution is a once-daily, nebulized long-acting muscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”) approved for the maintenance treatment of COPD in the US. Our market research indicates there is an enduring population of COPD patients in the US that either need or prefer nebulized delivery for maintenance therapy. LAMAs are recognized by international COPD treatment guidelines as a cornerstone of maintenance therapy for COPD, regardless of severity of disease. YUPELRI is the first and only once-daily, long-acting single-agent product for COPD patients who require, or prefer, nebulized therapy. YUPELRI's stability in both metered dose inhaler and dry powder inhaler (“MDI/DPI”) formulations suggest that this LAMA could also serve as a foundation for novel handheld combination products.
     Mylan Collaboration
 In January 2015, Mylan Ireland Limited (“Mylan”) and we established a strategic collaboration for the development and commercialization of revefenacin. Partnering with a world leader in nebulized respiratory therapies enables us to expand the breadth of our revefenacin development program and extend our commercial reach beyond the acute care setting. Mylan funded the Phase 3 development program of YUPELRI, enabling us to advance other high value pipeline assets alongside YUPELRI.
     Under the terms of the Mylan Development and Commercialization Agreement (the “Mylan Agreement”), Mylan and we co-develop revefenacin for COPD and other respiratory diseases. We have led the US Phase 3 development program for YUPELRI in COPD, and Mylan was responsible for reimbursement of our costs related to the registrational program up until the approval of the first new drug application (“NDA”), after which costs are shared. With YUPELRI

approved in the US, Mylan is leading commercialization, and we co-promote the product in the US under a profit and loss sharing arrangement (65% to Mylan; 35% to Theravance Biopharma). Following shipments into commercial channel in late 2018, we and Mylan formally launched our sales and marketing efforts in early 2019. Outside the US (excluding China), Mylan will be responsible for development and commercialization and will pay us a tiered royalty on net sales at percentage royalty rates ranging from low double-digits to mid-teens. 
     Under the Mylan Agreement, Mylan paid us an initial payment of $15.0 million in cash in the second quarter of 2015. Also, pursuant to an agreement to purchase ordinary shares entered into on January 30, 2015, Mylan Inc., the indirect parent corporation of Mylan, made a $30.0 million equity investment in us, buying 1,585,790 ordinary shares from us in February 2015 in a private placement transaction at a price of approximately $18.918 per share, which represented a 10% premium over the volume weighted average price per share of our ordinary shares for the five trading days ending on January 30, 2015. In February 2016, we earned a $15.0 million development milestone payment for achieving 50% enrollment in the Phase 3 twelve-month safety study. As of December 31, 2018, we are eligible to receive from Mylan additional potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments totaling up to $205.0 million in the aggregate, with $160.0 million associated with YUPELRI monotherapy, and $45.0 million associated with future potential combination products. Of the $160.0 million associated with monotherapy, $150.0 million relates to sales milestones based on achieving certain levels of net sales and $10.0 million relates to regulatory actions in the EU. We do not expect to earn any milestone payments from Mylan in 2019.
     We retain worldwide rights to revefenacin delivered through other dosage forms, such as a MDI/DPI, while Mylan has certain rights of first negotiation with respect to our development and commercialization of revefenacin delivered other than via a nebulized inhalation product. In China, we retain all rights to revefenacin in any dosage form. 
     Phase 3 Clinical Program in COPD and FDA Approval 
 In September 2015, we announced with our partner Mylan the initiation of the Phase 3 development program for YUPELRI for the treatment of COPD. The Phase 3 development program included two replicate three-month efficacy studies and a single twelve-month safety study. The two efficacy studies examined two doses (88 mcg and 175 mcg) of YUPELRI inhalation solution administered once-daily via nebulizer in patients with moderate to severe COPD. The Phase 3 efficacy studies were replicate, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials designed to provide pivotal efficacy and safety data for once-daily YUPELRI over a dosing period of 12 weeks, with a primary endpoint of trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on day 85. The Phase 3 safety study was an open-label, active comparator study of 12 months duration.
     In October 2016, we announced positive top-line results from the two replicate Phase 3 efficacy studies of YUPELRI in more than 1,200 moderate to very severe COPD patients, and in May and November 2017 we reported additional data from these studies. Both Phase 3 efficacy studies met their primary endpoints, demonstrating statistically significant improvements over placebo in trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of dosing for each of the YUPELRI doses studied (88 mcg once daily and 175 mcg once daily). The studies also demonstrated that the 88 mcg and 175 mcg doses of YUPELRI were generally well tolerated, with comparable rates of adverse events and serious adverse events across all treatment groups (active and placebo). In July 2017, we announced positive top-line results from the twelve-month safety study in more than 1,000 COPD patients. Data demonstrated that both the 88 mcg and 175 mcg doses of YUPELRI were generally well tolerated, with low rates of adverse events and serious adverse events, comparable to those seen with the active comparator. Together, the three studies enrolled approximately 2,280 patients. 
     In November 2017, we submitted to the FDA for filing an NDA for YUPELRI supported by data from the two replicate Phase 3 efficacy studies and twelve-month safety study. In November 2018, YUPELRI was approved by the FDA for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD.
     Phase 3b PIFR Study
 In March 2017, we initiated a Phase 3b study of YUPELRI in patients with suboptimal peak inspiratory flow rate (“PIFR”). This study was not required for NDA approval and was designed to support commercialization of YUPELRI. The purpose of the study was to assess whether nebulized YUPELRI was superior to handheld tiotropium (dosed via the Handihaler® device) in a broad population of COPD patients with suboptimal PIFR. The primary endpoint was 

 
  10

 
improvement in lung function, as measured by trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) after 4 weeks of treatment. 
     The PIFR study was completed in the first quarter of 2018. In the overall population of approximately 200 moderate to very severe (GOLD Stage 2/3/4) COPD patients, we saw numerical improvements for YUPELRI over tiotropium, but these improvements were not statistically significant, and as a result the study failed to meet the primary endpoint. In the pre‑specified subgroup of severe and very severe (GOLD 3/4) COPD patients, which represented approximately 80% of the patients in the study, YUPELRI demonstrated nominally statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in trough FEV1 versus tiotropium. Data generated in the study provide important insights to inform future potential studies of YUPELRI in COPD patients with suboptimal PIFR. YUPELRI was well tolerated in this study, with no new safety issues identified. We plan to publish additional analyses of these results from this study in a future medical meeting or publication.
     TD-8236

TD-8236 is an investigational, lung-selective inhaled JAK inhibitor that has demonstrated a high affinity and selectivity for each of the JAK family enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2). Through the inhibition of these kinases, TD-8236 interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. TD-8236 is specifically designed to be an inhaled treatment delivered exclusively to the lungs with a dry-powder inhaler with minimal systemic exposure. With multiple JAK-dependent pathways clinically validated in asthma and COPD, we believe it offers potentially broad activity across a range of serious respiratory diseases. In severe asthma, patient heterogeneity includes both Th2-high (eosinophilic) and Th2-low (neutrophilic, paucigranulocytic, and mixed granulocytic) phenotypes, but current approved novel biologics address only Th2-high asthma. We recognize a treatment need for the prevention of exacerbations and symptom control for patients regardless of Th2 phenotype. In pre-clinical assessments, TD-8236 has shown to potently inhibit targeted mediators of Th2-high and Th2-low asthma in human cells. In November 2018, we announced first subject dosed in a Phase 1 study of TD-8236, designed to evaluate safety and provide biomarker data in both healthy volunteers and asthma patients.
     Velusetrag (TD‑5108)
 Velusetrag is an oral, investigational medicine developed for gastrointestinal motility disorders. It is a highly selective agonist with high intrinsic activity at the human 5-HT4 receptor. In 2012, we partnered with Alfasigma S.p.A. (“Alfasigma”) (formerly Alfa Wassermann S.p.A.) in the development of velusetrag and its commercialization in certain countries. In April 2014, we announced top-line results from the initial Phase 2 proof-of-concept study under this partnership, which evaluated gastric emptying, safety and tolerability of multiple doses of velusetrag.
     In August 2017, we announced positive top-line results from a 12-week, Phase 2b study of velusetrag characterizing the impact on symptoms and gastric emptying of three oral doses of velusetrag (5, 15 and 30 mg) compared to placebo administered once daily over 12 weeks of therapy. Results from the study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in gastroparesis symptoms and gastric emptying for patients receiving 5 mg of velusetrag as compared to placebo. Patients in the 15 and 30 mg velusetrag study arms demonstrated statistically significant improvements in gastric emptying, but they did not experience statistically significant improvements in gastroparesis symptoms. Velusetrag was shown to be generally well tolerated, with 5 mg and placebo having comparable rates of adverse events and serious adverse events. Completion of the Phase 2b study was followed by dialogue with regulatory authorities in the US and EU regarding further development of velusetrag. 
     In late April 2018, Alfasigma exercised its option to develop and commercialize velusetrag. As a result, Alfasigma paid us a total of $11.0 million, comprised of a $10.0 million option exercise fee and a $1.0 million non-refundable reimbursement. Additionally, we elected not to pursue further development of velusetrag, based on our planned pipeline investments and in light of an FDA requirement that a chronically administered gastroparesis product in this class complete a large Phase 3 safety study. Global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize velusetrag transferred to Alfasigma under the terms of the existing collaboration agreement. Also under the terms of the collaboration with Alfasigma, we are entitled to receive future potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $26.8 million, and tiered royalties on global net sales ranging from high single digits to the mid-teens.

     VIBATIV® (telavancin)

VIBATIV is a bactericidal, once-daily injectable antibiotic to treat patients with serious, life-threatening infections due to Staphylococcus aureus and other Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant (“MRSA”) strains, discovered and developed by Theravance Biopharma. VIBATIV is approved in the US for the treatment of adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (“cSSSI”) caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria and for the treatment of adult patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (“HABP”/“VABP”) caused by susceptible isolates of Staphylococcus aureus when alternative treatments are not suitable. In addition, in 2016, the FDA authorized new clinical data into the VIBATIV label concerning concurrent bacteremia in cases of HABP/VABP and cSSSI. VIBATIV is also indicated in Canada and Russia for cSSSI and HABP and VABP caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA.        In November  2018, we sold VIBATIV to Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Cumberland”) pursuant an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”). Cumberland paid us $20.0 million at the closing of the transaction and will pay (i) $5.0 million on or before April 1, 2019 and (ii) tiered royalties of up to 20% of US net sales of VIBATIV until such time as royalties cumulatively total $100.0 million.
     In connection with the sale of VIBATIV, Cumberland acquired, among other things, (i) intellectual property rights relating to VIBATIV, (ii) active pharmaceutical ingredient for VIBATIV, work-in-process and finished drug product, (iii) the US marketing authorization for VIBATIV, (iv) certain assigned contracts relating to the manufacture and commercialization of VIBATIV, and (v) books and records related to VIBATIV. Cumberland also assumed certain clinical study obligations related to VIBATIV and post-closing liabilities and obligations relating to VIBATIV as described in the Agreement. The Company agreed to provide transition services to Cumberland for limited periods of time following the consummation of the transaction. 
     Our acute care sales force, supported by our independent marketing and medical affairs teams, marketed VIBATIV in the US until shortly after the sale to Cumberland in late 2018. As of early 2019, the commercial organization is focused on supporting YUPELRI in the US in partnership with Mylan.
     Selective 5-HT4 Agonist (TD-8954)
 Takeda Collaborative Arrangement
 In June 2016, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Millennium”) (the “Takeda Agreement”), in order to establish a collaboration for the development and commercialization of TD-8954 (TAK-954), a selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist. Millennium is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE: 4502), a publicly-traded Japanese corporation listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (collectively with Millennium, “Takeda”). TD-8954 is being developed for potential use in the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders. Under the terms of the Takeda Agreement, Takeda will be responsible for worldwide development and commercialization of TD-8954. We received an upfront cash payment of $15.0 million and will be eligible to receive success-based development, regulatory and sales milestone payments from Takeda. We will also be eligible to receive a tiered royalty on worldwide net sales by Takeda at percentage royalty rates ranging from low double-digits to mid-teens.     Research Projects
 Our research goal is to design organ-selective medicines that target diseased tissues, without systemic exposure, in order to maximize patient benefit and minimize risk. The intention is to expand the therapeutic index of our potential medicines compared to conventional systemic therapies. Our efforts leverage years of experience in developing lung-selective medicines, such as YUPELRI, to treat respiratory diseases, and have led to the discovery of the gut-selective pan-JAK inhibitor TD-1473 in inflammatory intestinal diseases and the lung-selective inhaled JAK inhibitor TD-8236 in serious respiratory disease. We plan to advance towards the clinic other research projects with various mechanisms of action, each specifically tailored for the organ of interest, as we identify and validate potentially appropriate compounds. Our research is focused in the areas of inflammation and immunology, and our pipeline of internally discovered programs is targeted to address significant patient needs.

     Other Programs
 Neprilysin (“NEP”) Inhibitor Program (TD-0714 and TD-1439)
 Neprilysin (“NEP”) is an enzyme that degrades natriuretic peptides. These peptides play a protective role in controlling blood pressure and preventing cardiovascular tissue remodeling. Inhibiting NEP may result in clinical benefit for patients, including diuresis, control of blood pressure, and reversing maladaptive changes in the heart and vascular tissue in patients with congestive heart failure. We recognize significant potential for a NEP inhibitor that can be used across a broad population of patients with cardiovascular and renal diseases, including acute and chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy. Our NEP inhibitor program consists of two compounds (TD-0714 and TD-1439), each of which demonstrated characteristics in line with our target product profile in Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers.
     TD-0714
 TD-0714 is our most advanced NEP inhibitor compound. In 2016, a Phase 1 single ascending dose (“SAD”) study in healthy volunteers demonstrated that the compound achieved maximal and sustained levels of target engagement for 24 hours after a single-dose, supporting the drug’s potential for once-daily dosing. Target engagement was measured by dose-related increases in the levels of cyclic GMP (cGMP, a well-precedented biomarker of NEP engagement). TD-0714 also demonstrated very low levels of renal elimination, as evidenced by intravenous microtracer testing technology, and a favorable tolerability profile. Findings from a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) study in healthy volunteers were consistent with the SAD study in healthy volunteers, demonstrating sustained target engagement, low levels of renal elimination, and a favorable tolerability profile.
     TD-1439
 TD-1439 is a second NEP inhibitor compound, which is structurally distinct from TD-0714. In 2017, Phase 1 SAD and MAD studies of TD-1439 demonstrated characteristics which met our target product profile, including sustained 24-hour target engagement, low levels of renal elimination and a favorable tolerability profile.
     The results from the Phase 1 programs demonstrate potential in a broad range of cardiovascular and renal diseases, including in patients with compromised renal function. We are evaluating next steps for both compounds in our NEP inhibitor program clinical program.
     Economic Interest in GSK‑Partnered Respiratory Programs
 We are entitled to receive an 85% economic interest in any future payments that may be made by GSK to Theravance Respiratory Company, LLC (“TRC”) pursuant to its agreements with Innoviva (net of TRC expenses paid and the amount of cash, if any, expected to be used by TRC pursuant to the TRC LLC Agreement over the next four fiscal quarters) relating to the GSK-Partnered Respiratory Programs, which Innoviva partnered with GSK and assigned to TRC in connection with Innoviva’s separation of its biopharmaceutical operations into its then wholly-owned subsidiary Theravance Biopharma in June 2014. The GSK-Partnered Respiratory Programs consist primarily of the TRELEGY ELLIPTA program and the inhaled Bifunctional Muscarinic Antagonist-Beta2 Agonist (“MABA”) program, each of which are described in more detail below. We are entitled to this economic interest through our equity ownership in TRC. Our economic interest does not include any payments associated with RELVAR® ELLIPTA®/BREO® ELLIPTA®, ANORO® ELLIPTA® or vilanterol monotherapy. The following information regarding the TRELEGY ELLIPTA and MABA programs is based solely upon publicly available information and may not reflect the most recent developments under the programs.
     TRELEGY ELLIPTA (the combination of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol)
 TRELEGY ELLIPTA is the first treatment to provide the activity of an inhaled corticosteroid (FF) plus two bronchodilators (UMEC, a LAMA, and VI, a long-acting beta2 agonist, or LABA) in a single delivery device administered once-daily. TRELEGY ELLIPTA is approved for use in the US and EU for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of patients with COPD. We are entitled to receive an 85% economic interest in the royalties payable by GSK to TRC on worldwide net sales (net of TRC expenses paid and the amount of cash, if any, expected to be 

 
  13

 
used by TRC pursuant to the TRC LLC Agreement over the next four fiscal quarters). Those royalties are upward-tiering from 6.5% to 10%, resulting in cash flows to Theravance Biopharma of approximately 5.5% to 8.5% of worldwide net sales of TRELEGY ELLIPTA. Theravance Biopharma is not responsible for any of GSK’s costs related to the development or commercialization of TRELEGY ELLIPTA.
     Innoviva and GSK conducted two global pivotal Phase 3 studies of TRELEGY ELLIPTA in COPD, the IMPACT study and the FULFIL study. 
     The IMPACT study, which enrolled 10,355 COPD patients, was initiated in July 2014. In September 2017, GSK and Innoviva disclosed positive headline results from the IMPACT study, in which data demonstrated statistically significant reductions in the annual rate of on-treatment moderate/severe exacerbations for TRELEGY ELLIPTA (100/62.5/25mcg) when compared with two, once-daily dual COPD therapies RELVAR® ELLIPTA®/BREO® ELLIPTA® (FF/VI), an ICS/LABA combination, and ANORO® ELLIPTA® (UMEC/VI), a LAMA/LABA combination. In addition, statistically significant improvements were observed across all pre-specified key secondary endpoints and associated treatment comparisons. 
     The FULFIL study, which enrolled 1,810 COPD patients, was initiated in February 2015. In June 2016, GSK and Innoviva disclosed positive top‑line results from the FULFIL study, in which data demonstrated superiority of TRELEGY ELLIPTA as compared to twice‑daily SYMBICORT® TURBOHALER® (budesonide/formoterol) in improving lung function and health‑related quality of life, as well as reducing exacerbations in COPD patients.
 In September 2017, GSK and Innoviva announced that the FDA approved TRELEGY ELLIPTA for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of appropriate patients with COPD. In April 2018, GSK and Innoviva announced the FDA approved a supplemental new drug application (“sNDA”) containing data from the IMPACT study, resulting in an expanded indication for the product. The updated indication is for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. It is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations. In addition, the FDA removed a boxed warning from TRELEGY ELLIPTA prescribing information. 
     In December 2017, GSK and Innoviva announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for TRELEGY ELLIPTA as a maintenance treatment for appropriate patients with COPD.
     In February 2018, GSK and Innoviva announced the submission of the IMPACT data to the EMA as part of a type II variation to support an expanded label for TRELEGY ELLIPTA in Europe for the maintenance treatment of moderate to severe COPD, and in November 2018, GSK and Innoviva announced the European Commission authorized an expanded label for once-daily TRELEGY ELLIPTA. The updated indication for TRELEGY ELLIPTA is as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe COPD who are not adequately treated by a combination of an ICS and a LABA or a combination of a LABA and a LAMA.
     Additionally, in December 2016, GSK and Innoviva announced the initiation of the Phase 3 (CAPTAIN) study of TRELEGY ELLIPTA in patients with asthma. GSK and Innoviva have indicated that the CAPTAIN study is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019, and if positive, an expected sNDA submission in the second half of 2019.
     Inhaled Bifunctional Muscarinic Antagonist-Beta2 Agonist (MABA)
 GSK961081 (‘081), also known as batefenterol, is an investigational, single-molecule bifunctional bronchodilator with both muscarinic antagonist and beta2 receptor agonist activity that was discovered by us when we were part of Innoviva. 
     If a single-agent MABA medicine containing ‘081 is successfully developed and commercialized, we are entitled to receive an 85% economic interest in the royalties payable by GSK to TRC on worldwide net sales (net of TRC expenses paid and the amount of cash, if any, expected to be used by TRC pursuant to the TRC LLC Agreement over the next four fiscal quarters), which royalties range between 10% and 20% of annual global net sales up to $3.5 billion, and 7.5% for all annual global net sales above $3.5 billion. If a MABA medicine containing ‘081 is commercialized only as a combination product, such as ‘081/FF, the royalty rate is 70% of the rate applicable to sales of the single-agent MABA 

 
  14

 
medicine. If a MABA medicine containing ‘081 is successfully developed and commercialized in multiple regions of the world, TRC is eligible to receive contingent milestone payments from GSK. The agreements allow for total milestones of up to $125.0 million for a single-agent medicine and an incremental $125.0 million for a combination medicine. Of these amounts, $112.0 million in potential milestones remain for a single-agent medicine, and $122.0 million remain for a combination medicine. In each case, we would be entitled to receive an 85% economic interest in any such payments (net of TRC expenses paid and the amount of cash, if any, expected to be used by TRC pursuant to the TRC LLC Agreement over the next four fiscal quarters).
     Theravance Respiratory Company, LLC 
 Our equity interest in TRC is the mechanism by which we are entitled to the 85% economic interest in any future payments made by GSK under the strategic alliance agreement and under the portion of the collaboration agreement assigned to TRC by Innoviva (net of TRC expenses paid and the amount of cash, if any, expected to be used by TRC pursuant to the TRC LLC Agreement over the next four fiscal quarters). The royalty payments from GSK to TRC arising from the net sales of Trelegy Ellipta are presented on our consolidated statements of operations under “income from investment in TRC, LLC” and is classified as non-operating income. 75% of the “income from investment in TRC, LLC,” as evidenced by the Issuer Class C Units, is available only for payment of the 9.0% fixed-rate non-recourse term notes due 2033 (the “Non-Recourse 2033 Notes”) and is not available to pay our other obligations or the claims of our other creditors. The drug programs assigned to TRC include all Trelegy Ellipta products and the MABA program, as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutically active components, such as an inhaled corticosteroid (“ICS”), as well as any other product or combination of products that may be discovered and developed in the future under these GSK agreements.
     Our special purpose subsidiary Triple Royalty Sub LLC (the “Issuer”) issued the Non-Recourse 2033 Notes in November 2018, which are secured by all of the Issuer’s right, title and interest as a holder of certain membership interests (the “Issuer Class C Units”) in TRC. The Issuer Class C Units entitle the Issuer to receive 63.75% of the economic interest that TRC receives in any future payments made by GSK under the agreements described above, or 75% of the income from our ownership interest in TRC. The primary source of funds to make payments on the Non-Recourse 2033 Notes will be 75% of the income from our ownership interest in TRC, as evidenced by the Issuer Class C Units. Since the principal and interest payments on the Non-Recourse 2033 Notes are ultimately based on royalties from TRELEGY ELLIPTA product sales, which will vary from quarter to quarter, the Non-Recourse 2033 Notes may be repaid prior to the final maturity date in 2033.
     Our Strategy
 Our core purpose is to create transformational medicines to improve the lives of patients suffering from serious illnesses. We strive to apply insight and innovation at each stage of our business, including research, development and commercialization. Our principle strategic objective is to transform the treatment of serious diseases with novel, organ-selective medicines, designed to expand the therapeutic index compared to conventional systemic therapies, in order to deliver value to patients, as well as payers and healthcare providers.
     We follow these core guiding principles in our mission to drive value creation:
     •Focus on insight and innovation;
 •Outsource non‑core activities;
 •Create and foster an integrated environment; and
 •Aggressively manage uncertainty.
 We manage our pipeline with the goal of optimizing program value and allocation of resources. We employ multiple strategies for commercialization of our products. Our approach may involve retaining product rights and marketing a product independently in the US or we may partner a product to extend our commercial reach to expand our geographic reach, and/or to manage the financial risk associated with the program. Alternatively, we may monetize or 

 
  15

 
divest an asset that we designate as outside our core business, where we believe the program is optimized by leveraging partner capabilities and removing or limiting our research and development costs.
     Manufacturing
 We rely primarily on a network of third‑party manufacturers, including contract manufacturing organizations, to produce our active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and our drug product. We believe that we have in‑house expertise to manage this network of third‑party manufacturers, and we believe that we will be able to continue to negotiate third‑party manufacturing arrangements on commercially reasonable terms and that it will not be necessary for us to obtain internal manufacturing capacity in order to develop or, potentially, commercialize our products. However, if we are unable to obtain contract manufacturing or obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms, or if manufacturing is interrupted at one of our suppliers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, we may not be able to develop our products as planned.
     Any inability to acquire sufficient quantities of API or drug product in a timely manner from current or future sources could disrupt our research and development programs and the conduct of future clinical trials. For more information, see the risk factors under the heading “We rely on a single source of supply for a number of our product candidates, and our business will be harmed if any of these single-source manufacturers are not able to satisfy demand and alternative sources are not available” of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
     Government Regulation
 The development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and our product candidates by us, our collaboration partners and licensees and Cumberland, GSK and Innoviva and our ongoing research are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the US and other countries. Before marketing in the US, any medicine must undergo rigorous preclinical studies and clinical studies and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Outside the US, the ability to market a product depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities which are subject to equally rigorous regulatory obligations. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In any country, however, the commercialization of pharmaceutical products is permitted only if the appropriate regulatory authority is satisfied that we have presented adequate evidence of the safety, quality and efficacy of the product.
     Before commencing clinical studies in humans in the US, we must submit to the FDA an investigational new drug application (“IND”) that includes, among other things, the general investigational plan and protocols for specific human studies, and the results of preclinical studies. An IND will go into effect 30 days following its receipt by the FDA unless the FDA issues a clinical hold. Once clinical studies have begun under the IND, they are usually conducted in three phases and under FDA oversight. These phases generally include the following:
     Phase 1. The product candidate is introduced into patients or healthy human volunteers and is tested for safety, dose tolerance and pharmacokinetics.
     Phase 2. The product candidate is introduced into a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications, assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
     Phase 3. If a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, the clinical study will be expanded to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population.
     The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. The NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) establishes timeframes for FDA review of NDAs, with a performance goal of reviewing and acting on 90 percent of priority new molecular entity (“NME”) NDA submissions within 6 months of the 60‑day filing date, and to 

 
  16

 
review and act on 90 percent of standard NME NDA submissions within 10 months of the 60‑day filing date. The 2007 Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act gave the FDA authority to require implementation of a formal Risk Evaluation and Management Strategy to ensure that the benefits of a product outweigh its risks. At the end of the review period, the FDA communicates either approval of the NDA or a complete response listing the application’s deficiencies.
     Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with post‑marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or quality issues are identified after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post‑marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the safety and effectiveness of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post‑marketing studies. The FDA has broad post‑market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations, and initiate criminal prosecution.
     If regulatory approval for a medicine is obtained, the clearance to market the product will be limited to those diseases and conditions approved by FDA and for which the medicine was shown to be effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies and specified in the medicine’s labeling. Even if this regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed medicine, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA ensures the quality of approved medicines by carefully monitoring manufacturers’ compliance with its current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations. The cGMP regulations for drugs contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packaging of a medicine. The regulations are intended to make sure that a medicine is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a medicine, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the medicine or manufacturer, including costly recalls or withdrawal of the medicine from the market.
     We, our collaboration partners and licensees are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations, and initiate criminal prosecution, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Outside the US our, our collaboration partners’, licensees’, GSK’s and Cumberland’s ability to market products will also depend on receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. Risks similar to those associated with FDA approval described above exist with the regulatory approval processes in other countries.
     United States Healthcare Reform 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together the “Healthcare Reform Act”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and impacts pricing and reimbursement of YUPELRI and the marketed drugs with respect to which we are entitled to royalty or similar payments, and related commercial operations. Moreover, certain legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Healthcare Reform Act have occurred in the 115th US Congress and under the Trump Administration and additional changes remain possible. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on the ability of us, our collaboration partners, or those commercializing products with respect to which we have an economic interest or right to receive royalties to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. For more information, see the risk factor under the heading “Changes in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as healthcare policy and other healthcare payor cost‑containment initiatives, may negatively impact us, our collaboration partners, or those commercializing products with respect to which we have an economic interest or right to receive royalties” of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.

 Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement

We participated in and had certain price reporting obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program for VIBATIV for which we remain responsible, as described in greater detail under the risk factor “If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
    
Our ability, and the ability of our collaboration partners, licensees, GSK and Cumberland to commercialize our products successfully, and our ability to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including, in the US, governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. The reimbursement environment is described in greater detail under the risk factor “Changes in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as healthcare policy and other healthcare payor cost‑containment initiatives, may negatively impact us, our collaboration partners, or those commercializing products with respect to which we have an economic interest or right to receive royalties” of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
     Fraud and Abuse Laws

Our interactions and arrangements with customers and third‑party payors are subject to applicable US federal and state fraud and abuse laws. These laws and the related risks are described in greater detail under the risk factor “Our relationships with customers and third‑party payors are subject to applicable anti‑kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings” of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.     Data Privacy and Protection
 We are subject to laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. In the US, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health‑related and other personal information. Similar obligations apply in foreign countries. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)  which entered into force on May 25, 2018 amplified existing data protection obligations in the EU. These laws and related risks are described in greater detail under the risk factor “If we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business” of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.     Patents and Proprietary Rights
 We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our technology is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Our success in the future will depend in part on obtaining patent protection for our product candidates. Accordingly, patents and other proprietary rights are essential elements of our business. Our policy is to seek in the US and selected foreign countries patent protection for novel technologies and compositions of matter that are commercially important to the development of our business. For proprietary know‑how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug discovery process that involve proprietary know‑how and technology that is not covered by patent applications, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require all of our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. Where it is necessary to share our proprietary information or data with outside parties, our policy is to make available only that information and data required to accomplish the desired purpose and only pursuant to a duty of confidentiality on the part of those parties.

 As of December 31, 2018, we owned 438 issued US patents and 1,672 granted foreign patents, as well as additional pending US patent applications and foreign patent applications. The claims in these various patents and patent applications are typically directed to compositions of matter, including claims covering product candidates, crystalline forms, lead compounds and key intermediates, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use and/or processes for making our compounds. In particular, our wholly‑owned subsidiary Theravance Biopharma R&D IP, LLC owns the following US patents which are listed in the FDA Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) for YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution: US Patent No. 7,288,657, expiring on December 23, 2025; US Patent No. 7,491,736, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 7,521,041, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 7,550,595, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 7,585,879, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 7,910,608, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 8,034,946, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 8,053,448, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 8,273,894, expiring March 10, 2025; and US Patent No. 10,106,503, expiring March 10, 2025 (each of the aforementioned expiration dates not including any patent term extensions that may be available under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984). Thus, the last to expire patent currently listed in the Orange Book for YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution expires on December 23, 2025. On December 19, 2018, we filed patent term extension (“PTE”) applications in the US Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for US Patent Nos. 7,288,657 and 7,585,879. These PTE applications are currently pending and if granted, we will be permitted to extend the term of one of these patents for the period determined by the USPTO.
     US issued patents and foreign patents generally expire 20 years after filing with the USPTO. The patent rights relating to YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution currently consist of US patents that expire in 2025, additional pending US patent applications and counterpart patents and patent applications in a number of jurisdictions, including Europe. Additionally, our patent rights relating to velusetrag,  ampreloxetine and TD-1473 currently include issued US composition of matter patents that expire in 2025, 2030 and 2036, respectively (not including any patent term extensions that may be available under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984), as well as additional issued US patents, pending US patent applications and/or counterpart patents and patent applications in a number of jurisdictions. Nevertheless, issued patents can be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products and threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Our patent position, similar to other companies in our industry, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. To maintain our proprietary position we will need to obtain effective claims and enforce these claims once granted. It is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force only for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. Also, we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in any issued patents or, if issued, whether the scope of the issued claims will be sufficient to protect our proprietary position.
     Competition
 The marketed products to which we are entitled to profit share revenue, royalty or similar payments, and our development programs target four therapeutic areas—infectious disease, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological. In research, we apply organ-selective expertise to biologically compelling targets to discover and develop medicines designed to treat underserved localized diseases and to limit systemic exposure, in order to maximize patient benefit and minimize risk. Our commercial infrastructure is focused primarily on the acute care setting. We expect that any medicines that we commercialize with our collaborative partners or on our own will compete with existing and future market‑leading medicines.
     Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to leverage our experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization to:
     •discover and develop medicines that are superior to other products in the market;
 •attract and retain qualified scientific, clinical development and commercial personnel;
 •obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our medicines and technologies;

 
  19

 

 •obtain required regulatory approvals;
 •commercialize approved products; and
 •successfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines.
 YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution, a long‑acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). YUPELRI competes predominantly with short‑acting nebulized bronchodilators used three to four times per day and the nebulized LAMA LonhalaTM MagnairTM (SUN-101/eFlow®) used two times per day. YUPELRI has the potential to be a primary maintenance therapy or to be used with nebulized long‑acting beta agonist (LABA) products used two times per day. 
     Trelegy Ellipta or FF/UMEC/VI (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol). Trelegy Ellipta competes in Europe with Trimbow (beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium bromide, dosed twice per day) from Chiesi Farmaceutici and, in the future, may compete with other closed triple products that are currently under development. AstraZeneca and Novartis both have closed triple products dosed twice per day in late stage development for COPD and/or asthma. 
     VIBATIV (telavancin). VIBATIV competes with vancomycin, linezolid and daptomycin, generic drugs that are manufactured by a variety of companies, as well as other drugs marketed to treat complicated skin and skin structure infections and hospital acquired and ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia caused by Gram‑positive bacteria. Currently marketed branded competitive products include but are not limited to Sivextro® (tedizolid) marketed by Merck & Co., Inc.; Teflaro® (ceftaroline) and Dalvance™ (dalbavancin) marketed by Allergan; and Orbactiv™ (oritavancin) marketed by Melinta Therapeutics. 
     Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 363 employees, of which 217 were engaged in research and development activities. Of our 363 employees, 345 were located in the US, and 18 were located in Ireland. We consider our employee relations to be good.  
     In January 2019, we announced a reduction in workforce to align with our focus on continued execution of key strategic programs, and advancement of selected late-stage research programs toward clinical development. Our overall headcount was reduced by approximately 50 individuals with the affected employees primarily focused on early research or the infrastructure in support of VIBATIV which we recently sold to Cumberland in November 2018. The workforce reduction is expected to be substantially completed in the first quarter of 2019.
