Operations
 
General
 
Worksport was founded in 2011 to take advantage of the limited innovation provided by existing tonneau cover manufacturers. Tonneau covers have remained much the same in price and design since 2005, with one main company controlling a majority of the tonneau cover market. This dynamic market segment is in need of a new innovative manufacturer of high quality, functional, and aggressively priced tonneau covers. Worksport has developed multiple products for the most prominent pick-up trucks available in North America. Details of each product can be found at www.Worksport.com. Worksport sells its products through wholesalers in Canada and the U.S. and through third-party online retailers. Worksport also manufactures its patented designed covers for other businesses under its private label and OEM manufacturing initiative.
 
On April 20th, 2018, the board of directors approved special resolutions to the articles of incorporation of Truxmart Ltd, as incorporated in the province on Ontario, Canada. The articles of the Corporation were amended to change the name of the Corporation from Truxmart Ltd. to Worksport Ltd.

2017 Truck Sales
 
Ram sold more pickup trucks in the United States during April 2017 than Chevrolet. Truck sales numbers are in. This is the second month this calendar year that Ram full-size truck lineup is outselling Chevrolet. Chevy Silverado is still in second place with Year-To- Date numbers, but the sales are declining when compared to same time years last year.
 
Ford F-Series is still number one in United States sales. Even if you combine the Silverado and Sierra sales together, these are still lower than the F-Series numbers. Although, Ford sales in April were about even when compared to last year (-0.2%).
 
Toyota Tundra is also sliding down in sales, but it has a firm grasp on the fifth place. The Nissan Titan is gaining sales with the availability of the half-ton and XD variants, but raw numbers are still relatively low. Nissan sold 4,033 Titans in April 2017. (http://www.tfltruck.com/2017/05/2017-april-pickup-truck-sales-sales-report/)
 
The August 2017 sales numbers for the United States are in. Ford F-Series continues to lead in full-size pickup truck sales. Chevrolet is now comfortable in second place for sales in August and so far this year. Ram struggled a little in August, but the company held the third position without much worry. GMC Sierra sales started to come up as well, but they are still down when compared to last year. Toyota Tundra had a fairly good month and about even for the month. Nissan Titan is still struggling to get sales momentum.

2018 Truck Sales

GM sold nearly the same number (small increase) of pickup trucks in 2018 as they did in 2017. The Chevy Silverado and the GMC Sierra combined for a total of 805,135 trucks in 2018. GM sold 803,807 full-size truck the year prior.

Canadian sales of pickup trucks began a rapid ascent as the economic collapse of a decade ago came to an end. If fuel prices fluctuated, pickup truck sales increased. If passenger car volume dropped, pickup truck sales improved. If SUV demand grew, pickup truck sales grew, too.
 
Then along came 2018, and five years of the pickup truck’s ascent came to a screeching halt. Don’t confuse the sector’s seven-per-cent year-over-year decline in 2018 with poor volume — Canadian businesses, governments, and individuals still acquired more new pickup trucks in 2018 than during any of those post-recession years.
 
But the growth rate was clearly not sustainable. Overall, auto sales grew nearly 40 per cent between 2009 and 2017; and pickup truck volume exploded at a 75 per cent clip during the same phase. There was bound to be a move toward the norm at some point, and that move began in 2018.
 
Pickup truck volume fell by 28,000 units over the last 12 months. The bulk of those losses came in the massive full-size category, which accounts for 9 out of every 10 pickup sales. Midsize pickup volume, on the other hand, actually increased seven per cent, even before the launches of the new Ford Ranger and Jeep Gladiator.
 
Pickups still produce one-fifth of all auto sales in Canada, a greater share than the same trucks south of the border. With figures from the Global Automakers of Canada, these are the 11 best-selling pickup trucks in Canada. In fact, these are figures for each and every pickup truck nameplate on sale in Canada.
 
11. Honda Ridgeline: 4,094, down 12 per cent
 10. Nissan Frontier: 4,134, down 3 per cent
 9. Nissan Titan: 5,445, up 4 per cent
 8. GMC Canyon: 6,706, up 7 per cent
 7. Chevrolet Colorado: 9,348, up 16 per cent
 6. Toyota Tundra: 11,738, up 24 per cent
 5. Toyota Tacoma: 13,878, up 11 per cent 2019 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro
 4. Chevrolet Silverado: 55,334, down 6 per cent
 3. GMC Sierra: 56,242, down 9 per cent
 2. Ram P/U: 84,854, down 14 per cent
 1. Ford F-Series: 145,694, down 6 per cent

In the USA, truck sales were solid.
 
The U.S. auto market has been strong in the first two quarters of 2018. More than 8.6 million cars have been sold in 2018 through the first half of the year, that’s a YTD year-over-year increase of nearly 2%, according to data from Kelley Blue Book, the automotive research company.
 
Demand for pickup trucks has been particularly strong, with YTD new sales hitting 1,415,389, according to Kelley Blue Book’s data. This has come with American consumers making a concurrent decision to abandon the sedan and passenger car.
 
All three of America’s big three automakers (Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) have pickup trucks on the market. In fact, the top-3 best-selling trucks so far in 2018 are Ford’s F-Series, GM’s Chevrolet Silverado, and FCA’s Ram Pickup.
 
But other truck models have broken in and gained market share. The trucks that have made the greatest year-over-year improvement in 2018 are GMC Canyon, Chevrolet Colorado, and Toyota Tacoma. In fact, Chevrolet Colorado’s year-over-year sales have risen a whopping 38.9% compared to this time in 2017.
 
The cars that saw the largest year-over-year drop in sales are Honda Ridgeline, Nissan Titan, and Ram Pickup. The Honda Ridgeline saw the greatest year-over-year decline, with its sales down 19.4% as compared to 2017.
 
Americans love their pickup trucks though. Below are the 11 best-selling full-size and mid-size pickup trucks in the first two quarters of 2018.
 
11. Honda Ridgeline: 14,988 sold in 2018. Down 19.4% over 2017.
 10. GMC Canyon: 16,848 sold in 2018. Up 13.2% over 2017.
 9. Nissan Titan: 23,294. -4.8%.

8. Nissan Frontier: 41,701. +10.3%.
 7. Toyota Tundra: 55,792. +4.0%.
 6. Chevrolet Colorado: 69,875. +38.9% 5. GMC Sierra: 100,874. +1.7%.
 4. Toyota Tacoma: 116,266. +22.9%.
 3. Ram Pickup: 233,539. -6.7%.
 2. Chevrolet Silverado: 291,074. +10.7%. 1. Ford F-Series: 451,138. +4.9%.

2018 SEMA Report
 
The 2018 SEMA Report shows the results of the previous year and indicates that 2017 was another good year for the specialty-equipment industry. The overall size of the market grew to $42.92 billion. The 4% growth continues a multiple-year trend. SEMA projects that enter the market will continue to grow through the end of 2018 and bring retail sales close to $45 billion.
 
This current growth trend is fueled by strong overall economic performance, including an ongoing decline in unemployment and growth in consumer spending. A strong economy paired with rising consumer confidence means that more people are willing to spend money on discretionary items, such as specialty automotive parts. While new vehicle sales have leveled off, they still remain at near-record highs—close to 17 million per year. Recently announced tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, etc. and other policy changes could affect the economy and the industry in 2018, but to this point, demand has been strong.

(excerpt from 2018 SEMA report, relating to the tonneau cover aftermarket in USA / non-oem dealer sales)
 
Background
 
For many years, consumers have had very limited options available to them from tonneau cover manufacturers. The leading manufacturers in the North American market have had very few new model developments. The tonneau cover market can be divided into four main styles of covers:
1. Soft Folding & Roll-up covers (Vinyl covers)
 2. Hard Folding & Standing Covers (Aluminum and FRP)
 3. Solid one piece caps and lids (Plastic & Fiberglass)
 4. Retractable Covers (Plastic & Aluminum)
 

Page 8 of 40
------------


We believe the consumer favors models that are the least cumbersome, most functional, and lowest initial cost. Solid one piece covers and retractable covers are the least desirable because of their limited functionality and overall cost. Therefore, the most popular covers in today’s market are soft and hard folding/rolling tonneau covers.
 
Market Analysis and Distribution
 
The Specialty Equipment (aftermarket) consists of three major types of customers which include; master warehouse distributor, dealer / wholesaler, and end retail consumer. Master warehouse distributors will stock and distribute product to their customers, which are usually local dealers and wholesalers. Dealers and wholesalers are local stores which sell product to some businesses and retail consumers in their area and online. Dealers will purchase most of their product from their local distributor who will deliver to them regularly. Retail end consumers are simply the end user of your product. Worksport currently sells its product line through distributors and dealer networks.
 
The OEM market consists of vehicle manufactures with corporate offices and distribution points globally. Specifically, within North America the OEM market would consist of corporate offices and warehouses in Canada, USA, and Mexico. Target OEM’s for Worksport would be:
 
Toyota Motor Co.
 Ford Motor Co.
 Nissan Motor Co.
 General Motors
 FCA Automotive (RAM Trucks)
 
In 2017, each vehicle manufacturer above, purchases their OEM brand tonneau covers (tonneau cover installed at the factory) from an independent accessory manufacturer, such as Worksport. No vehicle manufacturer designs and manufacturers their own tonneau covers.
 
Worksport’s target market includes master warehouse distributors and dealers.
 
In the Canadian market, Worksport does the majority of its business with warehouse distributors, and select dealer customers. In the US market, Worksport’s customer base is mostly dealers and wholesalers.
 
Worksport USA is a supplying member of one of the largest after-market buying groups in the USA. American Aftermarket Group (AAG), owned by Line-X coatings, consists of over 700 car and truck accessory stores. Being a supplying member of AAG gives Worksport access to most of the large truck accessory dealers, wholesalers, and online stores in the USA. Our products are sold to AAG members by the sales staff at AAG and all customer service and maintenance is done through phone calls, emails, and infrequent visits.
 
Worksport Canada sells to only select dealers in Ontario as well as, the largest warehouse distributor in eastern Canada. Robert Thibert in Châteauguay, QC has over 600,000 square feet of warehouse space in three provinces in Canada. Robert Thibert is responsible for stocking and selling our product to their customer base in Canada. Worksport dealer sales in Ontario are to only select dealers who assist with product feedback.
 
Regular contact is made with our customer base about new product, promotions, updates, and general sales by phone, email, and in person, when possible.
 
A partial list of our customers includes:
 
Enterprise Robert Thibert (Québec, Canada)
 Trailer Parts Etc. (Florida, USA)
 Auto Zone (California)
 Turn 5 Distributing
 
Competition
 
Companies that compete in this market are Truck Hero Group, Tonno Pro and Rugged Liner however not all companies charge competitive prices:
 
The Extang (TruckHero) Trifecta retails in the USA for $425. The Tonno Pro Tri Fold retails for $269. The Rugged Liner Tri Fold retails for $329. Whereas the Worksport Tri Fold retails for CAD$259; US$239.
 
The Extang Solid Fold retails in the USA for $799. The Rugged Liner Hard Fold retails for $689. The Worksport Forte retails at CAD$699; US$689.

Low profile Roll-Up covers are manufactured by many different companies. The two most popular Roll-Up covers are the Truxedo (TruckHero) Low-ProQT, which retails for $499 and the Tonno Pro Low-Roll which retails for $269. The Worksport Roll-Up retails for $CAD299; US$269.
 
Truck Hero Group is the holding company for Extang Corporation, TruXedo, Inc., BedRug, Inc, UnderCover Inc., Advantage Truck Accessories Inc, Retrax Inc, and BAK Industries, NFAB, RealTruck.Com, Auto Customs, and ARE Truck Caps. They account for the majority of the competing brands in North America.
 
The area of biggest growth in the tonneau cover market is in the area of aggressively priced hard folding tonneau covers. Currently, the market distribution is shared by three primary participants, with LKQ/Keystone considered the market leader.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution Strategy
 
Worksport’s sales strategy is constantly changing and dynamic. Sales are made through warehouse distributors, as they typically handle product sales and promotion through their in-house sales department. To fully saturate the market a business must entice the retail consumer to purchase its product by way of a strong internet presence which will consist of YouTube videos and commercials, an interactive website, search engine optimization, social media, etc. The next step is to have strong working relationships and reputations among dealers and wholesalers who purchase Worksport’s product, either directly or through distributors.
 
Worksport will continue to grow private label sales where Worksport sells products, branded as other companies’ products. Clients who wish to participate in the tonneau cover market, but do not have the ability to navigate the complex manufacturing processes paired with challenging intellectual property rights can utilize Worksports designs, patents, factories, and distribution infrastructure to be able to stock and sell its own unique product without facing any challenges of directly manufacturing.
 
Worksport hopes to become the leader in the tonneau cover market through innovation. Our main objective is to design and engineer our products to better suit todays new, dynamic, and innovative models of light trucks.
 
Worksport hopes to become a significant player in our market segment by always maintaining a strong emphasis on customer service, innovation, quality, and a robust global branding.
 
Worksport’s target market is North, Central, and South America with future plans to expand globally to other market opportunities. Worksport intends to earn revenues from both the automotive specialty equipment market as well as OEM production for vehicle manufactures, globally.
 
Worksport also plans to gain market share and core value by internally engineering our products to best suit the evolving needs of the consumer as well as a strong intellectual property portfolio (2 Granted Patent, 3 patent applications in Canada and USA – as of 2019)
 
The Company’s current product lines are as follows:
 
1. Worksport Tri Fold (introduced in 2011)
 
The Worksport Tri Fold is our staple soft folding tonneau cover. The Tri Fold is made with features such as stainless steel hardware, double coated vinyl tarp, and all aluminum and plastic coated front clamps. The Tri Fold is made available to our customer base at an average cost savings of 5% over competing products. Worksport has designed multiple unique variations of this product and is currently manufacturing various versions for Worksport branded sales, as well as private label clients.
 
2. Worksport Smart Fold (introduced in 2012)
 
The Worksport Smart Fold is our second product to market and offers our patented rear Smart Latch system. The Smart Fold is the first innovation in the rear latching system offered on soft folding tonneau covers. The Smart Fold cover comes with all of the same features as the Tri Fold but with a new rear latch system that allows the cover to be opened by simply pulling a release cable which is a new innovation in the soft tri fold segment of our market.
 
The Company introduced three new products at the Specialty Equipment Manufacturers Association (SEMA) show in Las Vegas in November 2014. These products were the following:
 
3. Worksport Quad-Fold (Introduced 2015)
 
The Worksport Quad-Fold will be the first vinyl wrapped tonneau cover to fold in four sections. This cover will also allow its users full bed access by being foldable upwards towards the rear window of the truck. We chose to make the world’s first quad folding cover so this cover is more compact when standing parallel to the back window of a truck, thus eliminating wind resistance and rear window obstruction.

4. Worksport Forte (2nd Gen launched in 2016 as Private Label in Canada Only)
 
Taking valuable information learned from the launch of the first generation Worksport Forte. The all-new redesigned Worksport Forte “GEN2” has been engineered to be easy to install and operate while being offered at an MAP price that fills a much needed void between soft and hard tonneau covers.
 
The GEN2 Forte cover will now be built using 6MM thick aluminum panels with a robust honeycomb core, coated in a durable matte- black scratch resistant powder coating. The GEN2 Forte cover will be 30% lighter and cost 25-30% less to manufacture. With robust packaging, the lighter weight GEN2 Forte will also save time and money with up to 10% more load quantity in a standard 40’ HC container, therefore maximizing value and product profitability. Notably, the GEN2 Forte will not come with the same cargo-division and tool bags as its predecessor, as cargo division and storage solutions are being closely reviewed and implemented with the Worksport Alpha series of products.
 
The GEN2 Forte will be manufactured as a Worksport branded product as well as a cornerstone product for private label manufacturing in North, Central, and South American markets.
 
In addition, we are currently re-engineering the Worksport Smart Fold latch system based on consumer feedback. As a consequence, the next generation Smart Fold covers will be far easier to install and will be available for both domestic and imported light trucks.
 
Worksport also launched its new Alpha series of tonneau covers at SEMA 2015. The Alpha products are set to be released late 2019, upon successful capital raise for new research and development. The Alpha and Alpha Helios model covers are anticipated to be very successful in the automotive aftermarket.
 
Production and Delivery
 
Worksport products are manufactured to our specifications and design in China. All of our soft (vinyl) covers are made in a factory in Ningbo, China. All future Worksport hard products are manufactured in China. Our soft cover factory is capable of producing 3,000 pieces per month and our hard cover factory is capable of producing 1,500 pieces per month. Production at both factories can be increased within thirty days to facilitate volumes up to ten times the Chinese contract manufacturers’ current output without any stress on their capacity.
Employees
 
Currently, we employ 1 full-time person. We may hire additional employees in the future to facilitate anticipated growth projections. We reimburse our employee for all necessary and customary business related expenses.
 
We have no plans or agreements which provide health care, insurance or compensation on the event of termination of employment or change in our control.
