ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Apogee, the Company or we) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Minnesota in 1949. We are a world leader in the design and development of value-added glass and metal products and services for enclosing commercial buildings and framing and displays. 
Our Company has four reporting segments, with three of the segments serving the commercial construction market: 

• | The Architectural Framing Systems segment designs, engineers, fabricates and finishes the aluminum frames used in customized window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems comprising the outside skin of buildings. For fiscal 2019, this segment accounted for approximately 51 percent of our net sales.


• | The Architectural Glass segment fabricates coated, high-performance glass used globally in customized window and wall systems. For fiscal 2019, this segment accounted for approximately 22 percent of our net sales.


• | The Architectural Services segment provides building glass and curtainwall installation services. For fiscal 2019, this segment accounted for approximately 21 percent of our net sales.


• | The Large-Scale Optical Technologies (LSO) segment manufactures value-added coated glass and acrylic products for framing and display applications. For fiscal 2019, this segment accounted for approximately 6 percent of our net sales.

On June 12, 2017, we acquired the stock of EFCO Corporation (EFCO), a privately-held U.S. manufacturer of architectural aluminum window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems for commercial construction projects, for approximately $190 million. On December 14, 2016, we acquired substantially all the assets of Sotawall, Inc. (Sotawall), a privately-held Canadian designer and fabricator of high-performance, unitized curtainwall systems for commercial construction projects, for approximately $138 million. Results of operations for each of these businesses have been included in the consolidated financial statements and within the Architectural Framing Systems segment since the date of each respective acquisition.
Strategy
Our strategies are to diversify revenue streams within the commercial construction industry and structure the business to provide more stable revenue growth and profit generation over an economic cycle. Our strategies are focused on diversification of end sectors served through growth from new geographies, new products and new markets, while improving margins through productivity, project selection initiatives and rigorous cost management. 
In an effort to reduce our exposure to the cyclical nature of the large-building segment of the commercial construction industry, we have expanded our focus to include mid-sized projects in the Architectural Glass segment and have grown our geographic footprint through organic growth and acquisitions in the Architectural Framing Systems segment. We have also increased our focus on retrofit and renovation of windows and curtainwall within our Architectural Framing and Architectural Glass segments as we have seen increased interest from the non-residential and high-end multi-family residential building sectors in upgrading building façades and improving energy efficiency.
In the Architectural Services segment, our emphasis is on improving margins through focused project selection, while continuing to deliver long-term organic growth through geographic expansion in line with our available project management capacity. 
Within the LSO segment, our strategy is to grow in newer display markets that desire the value-added properties that our glass and acrylic products provide, while continuing to convert the domestic and international custom picture-framing and fine art markets from clear uncoated glass and acrylic products to value-added products that protect art from UV damage and minimize reflection.
Across all our segments, we also regularly evaluate business development opportunities in adjacent sectors that will complement our existing portfolio. These business development strategies can be executed organically, through acquisition or with strategic alliances. 
Finally, we are constantly working to improve the efficiency and productivity of our operations by implementing lean manufacturing disciplines and automation.

Products and Services
Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments
These three segments participate in various phases of the value chain to design, engineer, fabricate and install customized glass and aluminum window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems comprising the outside skin of buildings in the commercial, institutional and high-end multi-family residential construction sectors. 
Within our Architectural Framing Systems segment, we design and fabricate window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems using our customized aluminum and glass, or glass supplied by others. We also provide finishing services for metal components used in windows and curtainwall, as well as plastic components for other products.
In our Architectural Glass segment, we apply ultra-thin, high-performance coatings to uncoated glass to create a variety of aesthetic characteristics, unique designs and energy efficiency, including varying levels of solar energy management to enhance energy-efficiency. We also laminate layers of glass and vinyl to protect against hurricanes and other severe impacts, and temper, or heat strengthen, glass to provide additional strength. Our high-performance glass is made-to-order and is typically fabricated into insulating and/or laminated glass units for installation into window, curtainwall, storefront or entrance systems.
By integrating technical capabilities, project management skills and field installation services, our Architectural Services segment provides design, engineering, fabrication and installation services for the outside skin of buildings. Our ability to efficiently design high-quality window and curtainwall systems and effectively manage the installation of building façades assists our customers in meeting the schedule and cost requirements of their jobs.
Our product and service offerings allow architects to create distinctive looks for commercial building such as office towers, hotels, education and athletic facilities and dormitories, health care facilities, government buildings, retail centers and multi-family residential buildings, while meeting functional requirements such as energy efficiency, hurricane, blast and other impact resistance and/or sound control.
LSO segment
The LSO segment provides coated glass and acrylic primarily for use in wall decor and display applications. Products vary based on size and coatings applied to provide conservation-grade UV protection, anti-reflective and anti-static properties and/or security features. 
Product Demand and Distribution Channels
Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments
Demand for the products and services offered by our Architectural segments is affected by changes in the North American commercial construction industries, as well as by changes in general economic conditions. Additionally, the Architectural Glass segment has an operation in Brazil and is, therefore, also impacted by Brazil's commercial construction industry and general economic conditions. 
We look at several external indicators to analyze potential demand for our products and services, such as U.S. and Canadian job growth, office space vacancy rates, credit and interest rates available for commercial construction projects, architectural billing statistics and material costs. We also rely on internal indicators to analyze demand, including our sales pipeline, made up of contracts in review, projects awarded or committed, and bidding activity. Our sales pipeline, together with ongoing feedback, analysis and data from our customers, architects and building owners, provide visibility into near- and medium-term future demand. Additionally, we evaluate data on U.S. and Canadian non-residential construction market activity, industry analysis and longer-term trends provided by external data sources. 
Our architectural products and services are used in subsets of the construction industry differentiated by building type, level of customization required, customers, geographic location and project size. 
Building type - The construction industry is typically segmented into residential construction and non-residential construction, which includes commercial, industrial and institutional construction. Our products and services are primarily used in commercial buildings (office towers, hotels and retail centers) and institutional buildings (education facilities and dormitories, health care facilities and government buildings), as well as in high-end multi-family residential buildings (a subset of residential construction).
Level of customization - The large majority of our projects involve a high degree of customization, as the product or service is based on customer-specified requirements for aesthetics, performance and size, and is designed to satisfy local building codes. 
Customers and distribution channels - Our customers are mainly glazing subcontractors and general contractors, with project design being influenced by architects and building owners. Our high-performance architectural glass is primarily sold using a

direct sales force and independent sales representatives. Installation services are sold by a direct sales force in certain metropolitan areas in the U.S. We sell our custom and standard windows, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems using a combination of direct sales forces, independent sales representatives and distributors.
Geographic location - We primarily supply architectural glass products to customers in North America, with some international sales of our high-performance architectural glass. We estimate the U.S. demand for architectural glass fabrication in non-residential buildings is in excess of $1.5 billion annually. Our aluminum framing systems, including windows, curtainwall, storefront and entrances, are marketed primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and we estimate demand to be in excess of $3 billion annually. In installation services, we are one of only a few architectural glass installation companies in the U.S. to have a national presence; we have the ability to provide remote installation project management throughout the U.S. We estimate the U.S. demand for installation services on commercial projects to be in excess of $10 billion. 
Project size - Our Architectural Glass segment primarily serves mid-size to monumental high-profile projects. Architectural Framing Systems primarily targets small and mid-size projects, and Architectural Services primarily serves mid-size projects. 
LSO segment
In our LSO segment, we have a leading brand of value-added coated glass and acrylic used in the custom picture-framing market. Under the Tru Vue brand, products are sold primarily in North America through national and regional retail chains using a direct sales force, as well as through local picture framing shops using an independent distribution network. We also supply our glass and acrylic products to museums, shops and galleries worldwide through independent distributors. We have also begun to supply to other display markets, such as digital signage, and to other wall decor sectors.
Competitive Conditions
Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments
The North American commercial construction market is highly fragmented. Competitive factors include price, product quality, product attributes and performance, reliable service, on-time delivery, lead-time, warranty and the ability to provide project management, technical engineering and design services. To protect and enhance our competitive position, we maintain strong relationships with architects, who influence the selection of products and services on a project, and with general contractors, who initiate projects and develop specifications. 
The competition in the commercial window and storefront manufacturing industry is highly fragmented, and our Architectural Framing Systems segment competes against several national, regional and local aluminum window and storefront manufacturers, as well as regional paint and anodizing finishing companies. Our businesses compete by providing high-quality products, faster than average lead times, and on-time delivery. 
In our Architectural Glass segment, we experience competition from regional glass fabricators who can provide certain products with attributes similar to our products. Within the market sector for large, complex projects, we encounter competition from international companies and large regional fabricators, some of which have benefited from the relative strength of the U.S. dollar and lower fabrication costs in recent years. We are able to compete with our competitors by providing high-quality, customizable products, short lead times, and responsive customer service. 
Our Architectural Services segment competes against national, regional and local glass installation companies. We distinguish ourselves from these competitors through our strong project management and ability to regularly meet or exceed each project's unique execution requirements. 
LSO segment
Product attributes, price, quality, marketing and service are the primary competitive factors in the LSO segment. Our competitive strengths include our excellent relationships with customers, innovative marketing programs and the performance of our value-added products. We compete with certain European and U.S. valued-added glass and acrylic products for picture framing and display.
Warranties
We offer product and service warranties that we believe are competitive for the markets in which our products and services are sold. The nature and extent of these warranties depend upon the product or service, the market and, in some cases, the customer being served. Our standard warranties are generally from two to 10 years for our architectural glass, curtainwall and window system products, while we generally offer warranties of two years or less on our other products and services.

We have several patents pertaining to our glass coating methods and products, for hybrid window wall/curtainwall systems and methods of installation and for our UV coating and etch processes for anti-reflective glass for the picture framing industry and fine art market. Despite being a point of differentiation from our competitors, no single patent is considered to be material.
Seasonality
We do not experience a significant seasonal effect in our Architectural segments. However, the construction industry is highly cyclical in nature and can be influenced differently by the effects of local economies. Within the LSO segment, North American picture framing glass and acrylic sales tend to increase in the September-to-December timeframe, but the timing of customer promotional activities may offset some of this seasonal impact.
Working Capital Requirements
Trade and contract-related receivables and other contract assets are the largest components of our working capital. Inventory requirements, mainly related to raw materials, are most significant in our Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Glass segments. 
Backlog
Backlog represents the dollar amount of signed contracts or firm orders, generally as a result of a competitive bidding process, which is expected to be recognized as revenue primarily in the near-term. Backlog is not a term defined under U.S. GAAP and is not a measure of contract profitability. Backlog should not be used as the sole indicator of our future revenue because we have a substantial amount of projects with short lead times that book-and-bill within the same reporting period and are not included in backlog. We have strong visibility beyond backlog, as projects awarded, verbal commitments and bidding activities are monitored separately and not included in backlog.
7

Architectural Framing Systems segment backlog grew to $399.5 million at year-end, net of intersegment eliminations, compared to $378.4 million at the end of the prior year, due primarily to strong order activity, particularly of longer lead-time contracts. Approximately 70 percent of the backlog in this segment is expected to be fulfilled in fiscal 2020, with the remainder expected to be filled in fiscal 2021 and beyond.
Architectural Glass segment backlog as of year-end was $71.3 million, compared to $36.7 million in the prior year, net of intersegment eliminations, due to strong order activity and extended lead times. The backlog is all expected to be fulfilled in fiscal 2020. 
Backlog in the Architectural Services segment as of year-end was $444.0 million, compared to $426.3 million in the prior year, due to timing of firm orders and signed contracts. Approximately 50 percent of the backlog in this segment is expected to be filled during fiscal 2020, with the remainder expected to be filled in fiscal 2021 and beyond. 
Backlog is not a significant metric for the LSO segment, as orders are typically booked and billed within a short time-frame.
Environment
We use hazardous materials in our manufacturing operations, and have air and water emissions that require controls. As a result, we are subject to stringent federal, state and local regulations governing the storage and use of these materials and disposal of wastes. We contract with outside vendors to collect and dispose of waste at our production facilities in compliance with applicable environmental laws. In addition, we have procedures in place that we believe enable us to properly manage the regulated materials used in and wastes created by our manufacturing processes. We believe we are currently in material compliance with such laws and regulations. While we will continue to incur environmental compliance costs for our ongoing manufacturing operations, we do not expect these to be material to our consolidated financial statements. We have one manufacturing facility where we are working to remediate historical environmental impacts. The remediation activities are being conducted without significant disruption to our operations. 
Employees
The Company had approximately 7,000 and 6,700 employees on March 2, 2019 and March 3, 2018, respectively. At March 2, 2019, 601 of these employees were represented by U.S. labor unions. 
International Sales
Information regarding export and international sales is included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, within Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
