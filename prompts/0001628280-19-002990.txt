ITEM 1. Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refers to WillScot Corporation ("WillScot") and its subsidiaries.
Our Company
Headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, we are a market leader in the North America specialty rental services industry. We provide innovative modular space and portable storage solutions to diverse end markets utilizing a branch network of over 120 locations throughout the United States (“US”), Canada and Mexico. 
With roots dating back more than 60 years, we lease modular space and portable storage units (our “lease fleet”) to customers in the commercial and industrial, construction, education, energy and natural resources, government and other end-markets. We deliver “Ready to Work” solutions through our growing offering of value-added products and services (“VAPS”), such as the rental of steps, ramps, and furniture packages, damage waivers and other amenities. These turnkey solutions offer customers flexible, low-cost and timely solutions to meet their space needs on an outsourced basis. We complement our core leasing business by selling both new and used units, allowing us to leverage our scale, achieve purchasing benefits and redeploy capital employed in our lease fleet.
WillScot was incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempt company, under the name Double Eagle Acquisition Corporation ("Double Eagle"), on June 26, 2015. Prior to November 29, 2017, Double Eagle was a Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination. On November 29, 2017, Double Eagle indirectly acquired Williams Scotsman International, Inc. (“WSII”) from Algeco Scotsman Global S.à r.l., (together with its subsidiaries, the “Algeco Group”), which is majority owned by an investment fund managed by TDR Capital LLP ( "TDR Capital"). As part of the transaction (the “Business Combination”), Double Eagle domesticated to Delaware and changed its name to WillScot Corporation.
WillScot is the holding company for the Williams Scotsman family of companies. All of our assets and operations are owned through Williams Scotsman Holdings Corp. (“WS Holdings”). We operate and own 91.0% of WS Holdings, and Sapphire Holding S.a r.l (“Sapphire”), an affiliate of TDR Capital owns the remaining 9.0%.
Products and Services
Our modular space and portable storage units are used to meet a broad range of customer needs. Our units are made of wood, steel, or aluminum frames mounted on a steel chassis, and typically range in size from 8 to 14 feet in width and 16 to 70 feet in length. Most units are equipped with air conditioning and heating, electrical and Ethernet cable outlets and, if necessary, plumbing facilities. Our units are transported by truck, either towed (if fitted with axles and hitches) or mounted on flat-bed trailers. Additionally, we offer VAPS along with our lease fleet (collectively, “rental equipment”) in order to deliver “Ready to Work” solutions to our customers. 
Modular Space
Panelized and Stackable Offices.  Our FlexTM panelized and stackable offices are the next generation of modular space technology and offer maximum flexibility and design configurations. These units provide a modern, innovative design, smaller footprint, ground level access and interchangeable panels, including all glass panels, that allow customers to configure the space to their precise requirements. These units have the ability to expand upwards (up to three stories) and outwards.
Single-Wide Modular Space Units. Single-wide modular space units include mobile offices and sales offices. These units offer maximum ease of installation and removal, and are deployed across the broadest range of applications in our fleet. These units typically have “open interiors” which can be modified using movable partitions, and include tile floors, air conditioning and heating units, partitions and, if requested, toilet facilities.
Section Modulars and Redi-Plex. Section modulars are two or more units combined into one structure. Redi-Plex complexes offer advanced versatility for large, open floor plans or custom layouts with private offices. Redi-Plex is built with clearspan construction, which eliminates interference from support columns and allows for up to sixty feet of open building width and building lengths that increase in twelve foot increments, based on the number of units coupled together. Our proprietary design meets a wide range of national and state building, electrical, mechanical and plumbing codes, which creates versatility in fleet management.
Classrooms. Classroom units are generally double-wide units adapted specifically for use by school systems or universities. Classroom units usually feature teaching aids, air conditioning/heating units, windows and, if requested, toilet facilities.
Container Offices. Container offices are International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) certified shipping containers that we convert for office use. They provide safe, secure, ground-level access with fully welded weather-resistant steel corrugated exteriors and exterior window guards made of welded steel and tamper-proof screws. Container offices are available in 20 and 40 foot lengths and in a combination of office and storage floor plans, or all-office floor plans.
Other Modular Space. We offer a range of other specialty products that vary across regions and provide flexibility to serve demands for local markets. Examples include toilet facilities to complement office and classroom units, guard houses, dormitories, and dining facilities.
Portable Storage Products
Storage units are typically ISO shipping containers with swing doors that are repurposed for commercial storage applications. These units are primarily ground-level entry, windowless storage containers made of heavy exterior metals for secure storage and water tightness. 
VAPS
We offer a thoughtfully curated portfolio of VAPS that make modular space and portable storage units more productive, comfortable, secure and “Ready to Work” for our customers. We lease furniture, steps, ramps, basic appliances, internet connectivity devices and other items to our customers for use in connection with our products. We also offer our lease customers a damage waiver program that protects them in case the leased unit is damaged. For customers who do not select the damage waiver program, we bill them for the cost of repairs above and beyond normal wear and tear.
Delivery, Installation and Removal
We provide delivery, site-work, installation, disassembly, unhooking and removal, and other services to our customers for an additional fee as part of our leasing and sales operations. Typically, units are placed on temporary foundations constructed by our in-house service technicians or subcontractors. These in-house service technicians or subcontractors also generally install any ancillary products and VAPS.
Product Leases
Rental equipment leasing is our core business. Over 90% of new lease orders are on our standard lease agreement, pre-negotiated master lease or national account agreements. The initial lease periods vary, and our leases are customarily renewable on a month-to-month basis after their initial term. While the initial lease term is often relatively short, the average actual lease duration of our lease portfolio (including month-to-month renewals) is significantly longer. Currently, our average minimum lease terms at delivery for modular space units and portable storage units are 11 months and 6 months, respectively, while the average duration of our lease portfolio is 30 months, including those leases acquired as part of the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions.
Customers are responsible for the costs of delivery and set-up, dismantling and pick-up, customer-specified modifications, costs to return custom modifications back to standard configuration at end of lease and any loss or damage beyond normal wear and tear. Our leases generally require customers to maintain liability and property insurance covering the units during the lease term, and to indemnify us from losses caused by the negligence of the customer or their employees.
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 130,000 modular space units and over 26,000 portable storage units, of which 94,223 of our modular space units, or 73%, and 18,161, or 69%, of our portable storage units were on rent.
Product Sales
We complement our core leasing business with product sales. Generally, we purchase new units from a broad network of third-party manufacturers for sale. We typically do not purchase new units for resale until we have obtained firm purchase orders (which normally are non-cancelable and include up-front deposits) for such units. Buying units directly for resale adds scale to our purchasing, which is beneficial to overall supplier relationships and purchasing terms. New unit sales are a natural extension of our leasing operations in situations where customers have long-lived or permanent projects, making it more cost-effective to purchase rather than to lease a standard unit. 
In the normal course of managing our business, we also sell idle used rental units at fair market value and units that are already on rent if the customer expresses interest in owning, rather than continuing to rent the unit. The sale of units from our rental equipment has historically been both profitable and a cost-effective method to finance the replenishment and upgrade of the lease fleet, as well as generate free cash flow during periods of lower rental demand and utilization. Our sales business may include modifying or customizing units to meet customer requirements. We also offer delivery, installation and removal-related services for an additional fee as part of our sales operations.
Customers
In 2018, we served over 50,000 customers. We believe that our customers prefer our modular space products over fixed, on-site built space because modular space products are a quick, flexible, and cost-effective solution for temporary or permanent expansion.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no customer accounted for more than 4% of our total
 consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 5% of our total consolidated revenues, reflecting a low customer concentration risk. We serve 15 discrete end markets and our strategy involves operating standardized rental equipment and "Ready to Work" solutions that can be redeployed across our diversified customer base and branch network. Key customer end-markets include:
Construction and Infrastructure
We provide office and storage space to a broad array of contractors associated with non-residential buildings and non-building infrastructure. Our client portfolio includes many of the largest general contractors and engineering, architecture, procurement, and construction companies in North America, as well as home builders, developers, and subcontractors. Examples include highway, street, bridge and tunnel contractors; water, sewer, communication and power line contractors; and special construction trades, including glass, glazing and demolition. Our construction and infrastructure customer base is characterized by a wide variety of contractors that are associated with original construction as well as capital improvements in the private, institutional and municipal arenas.
Commercial and Industrial
Our customers use our products as their primary office or retail space, to expand their existing commercial workspace, to increase their storage capabilities, and as temporary space for festivals, sporting, and other events. Customers in this category span a variety of industries ranging from agriculture, forestry & fishing; arts, media, hotels & entertainment; chemicals and other manufacturing; professional services; and retail & wholesale trade, including fast food and retail, as well as commercial offices, warehousing and other industrial end-markets.  
Energy and Natural Resources
Our products are leased to companies involved in up- mid- and down-stream oil and gas, electricity generation and transmission, utilities, mining exploration and extraction, and other related sectors. 
Education
Rapid shifts in populations within regions often necessitate quick expansion of education facilities, particularly in elementary, secondary schools and universities and colleges. Regional and local governmental budgetary pressures, classroom size reduction legislation, refurbishment of existing facilities and the expansion of charter schools have made modular classrooms a convenient and cost-effective way to expand capacity in education settings. In addition, our products are used as classrooms when schools are undergoing large scale modernization, which allows continuous operation of a school while modernization progresses. 
Government
Government customers consist of national, state, provincial and local public sector organizations. Modular space and portable storage solutions are particularly attractive to focused niches such as small municipal buildings, prisons and jails, courthouses, military installations, national security buildings and offices during building modernization, as well as disaster relief.
Competitive Strengths 
We believe that the following competitive strengths have been instrumental to our success and position us for future growth:
North American Market Leader with Significant Scale Advantages
We have developed our market position by leveraging our extensive branch network, diverse fleet, technical expertise, operational capabilities and strong brand awareness among our customers. Our extensive scale allows us to attract and retain talent, and implement industry leading technology tools and process. This results in significant operational benefits, such as optimization of fleet yield and utilization, efficient capital allocation, superior service capabilities and the ability to offer consistent "Ready to Work" solutions across all of our branch locations.
Customer, End-Market and Geographic Diversity
We have established strong relationships with a diverse customer base, ranging from large national accounts to small local businesses. Our customers operate in multiple end-markets, including commercial and industrial, construction, education, energy and natural resources and government, among others. We believe that the diversity of our customer end-markets reduces our exposure to changes related to a given customer, shifts within an industry or geographic region, and end-market industry seasonality, while also providing significant opportunities to grow the business. 
Since geographic proximity to customers is a competitive advantage in the industry, we maintain a network of over 120 branches and additional drop lots to better service our customers. Our branches typically have a sales staff dedicated to the local market, with transportation personnel responsible for delivery and pick-up of our units and yard personnel responsible for loading and unloading units and performing modifications, repairs and maintenance. Customers benefit from improved service and response times, reduced time to occupancy, better access to sales representatives and lower freight costs, which
 are typically paid by the customer. We benefit because we are able to spread regional overhead and marketing costs over a larger lease base, redeploy units within our branch network to optimize utilization, enhance our competitive position by providing ample local supply and offer profitable short-term leases which would either not be profitable or would be cost prohibitive to the customer without a local market presence. We believe that the geographic diversity of our branch network reduces our exposure to changes related to a given region, while presenting us with significant growth opportunities.
 Our broad customer base, as well as the diverse end uses of our units by our customers, reduces the impact of any individual customer, project, or end market on our business results and, when combined with our 30 month average lease duration, results in diversified and predictable lease revenue streams. 
The following chart illustrates the breakdown of our customers and revenue by end markets as of December 31, 2018. No customer accounted for more than 4% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, and we serve 15 distinct end markets by managing the pricing and utilization of standardized fleet assets that may be redeployed across our branch network.

REVENUE MIX BY END MARKET | CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION

Long-Life Fleet and Effective Fleet Management
We have made significant investments in our lease fleet. As of December 31, 2018, including the assets acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, our modular space and portable storage lease fleet consists of over 78.7 million square feet of re-locatable space, comprising approximately 156,000 units with a gross book value of approximately $2.3 billion. The average age of our lease fleet is approximately 14.4 years, while the economic life often exceeds 20 years. We utilize standard fleet maintenance procedures across the branch network, monitor fleet condition centrally, and ensure all units meet consistent quality and condition requirements, regardless of unit age, prior to delivery to a customer. 
Our standardized lease fleet meets multi-state industrial building codes, which allows us to leverage our branch network and rapidly redeploy units to areas of higher customer demand in the surrounding geographic markets, as well as easily modify our structures to meet specific customer needs. Additionally, we have the flexibility to refurbish existing units in order to re-lease them when we have sufficient customer demand or we can choose to sell used units to customers. 
The relative simplicity and favorable condition and quality of the lease fleet, as well as our sourcing strategy where we source our units with no significant dependence on any one particular supplier and have no long-term purchase contracts with manufacturers, provides purchasing flexibility and allows us to adjust such expenditures based on our business needs and prevailing economic conditions. 
We supplement our fleet spending with acquisitions, and adjust our investments in fleet and acquisitions opportunistically.
The following chart illustrates the breakdown of the net book value of our rental equipment between the various modular space product types, portable storage and VAPS as of December 31, 2018.
Our Industry 
Our business primarily operates within the modular space and portable storage markets, however our services span across a variety of related sectors, including furniture rental, transportation and logistics, facilities management and rental services, and commercial real estate.
Modular Space Market
The modular space market is fragmented. Modular space units are non-residential structures designed to meet federal, provincial, state and local building codes and, in most cases, are designed to be relocatable. Modular space units are constructed offsite, utilizing manufacturing techniques to prefabricate single or multi-story whole building solutions in deliverable modular sections. Units are typically constructed of steel, wood and conventional building materials.
The modular space market has evolved in recent years as businesses and other potential customers increasingly recognize the value of modular space. The key growth drivers in this market are:
•Growing need and demand for space - driven by general economic activity, including gross domestic product growth, industrial production, mining and natural resources activity, non-residential construction, urbanization, public and education spending, and the scale and frequency of special events.
•Increasing shift from traditional fixed, on-site built space to modular space solutions - driven by several advantages as compared with fixed, on-site built space, including:
◦Quick to install - the pre-fabrication of modular space units allows them to be put in place rapidly, providing potential long-term solutions to needs that may have materialized quickly.
◦Flexibility - flexible assembly design allows modular space units to be built to suit a customer’s needs while offering customers the ability to adjust their space as their needs change.
◦Cost effectiveness - modular space units provide a cost effective solution for temporary and permanent space requirements and allow customers to improve returns on capital in their core business.
◦Quality - the pre-fabrication of modular space units is based on a repeatable process in a controlled environment, resulting in more consistent quality.
◦Mobility - modular space units can easily be disassembled, transported to a new location and re-assembled.
◦Environmentally friendly - relocatable buildings promote the reuse of facilities, on an as-needed basis by the occupants.
Portable Storage Market
The portable storage market is highly fragmented and remains primarily local in nature. Portable storage provides customers with a flexible and low-cost storage alternative to permanent warehouse space and fixed-site self-storage. In addition, portable storage addresses the need for security while providing for convenience and immediate accessibility to customers.
Other Related Markets
In the normal course of providing our “Ready to Work” solutions, we perform services that are characteristic of activities in other industries. For example, we coordinate a broad network of third-party and in-house transportation and service resources to support the timely delivery of our products to, as well as maintenance on customer sites. Additionally, we design, source, lease and maintain a broad offering of ancillary products, including furniture, that render our modular structures immediately functional in support of our customers’ needs. We also provide technical expertise and oversight for customers regarding building design and permitting, site preparation and expansion or contraction of installed space based on changes in project requirements. Further, we have the capability to compete in adjacent markets, such as commercial and institutional housing, that have received less focus historically in the modular space market. We believe that this broad service capability differentiates us from other rental and business services providers and clearly differentiates us in the marketplace.
Competition
Although our competition varies significantly by local market, the modular space and portable storage industry is highly competitive and fragmented as a whole. We believe that participants in our industry compete on the basis of customer relationships, price, service, delivery speed, breadth and quality of equipment and additional services offered. We typically compete with one or more local providers in all of our markets, as well as with a limited number of national and regional companies. Some of our competitors may have greater market share in certain geographic regions. Significant modular space and portable storage competitors include Mobile Mini, Mobile Modular, Pac-Van, ATCO Structures & Logistics and BOXX Modular. Numerous other regional and local companies compete in individual markets. 
Strategic Acquisitions
The scalability of our branch network, corporate operating infrastructure, and technology and processes allows us to integrate acquisitions efficiently, realize cost savings, and improve the yield on acquired assets. As such, we manage an active acquisition pipeline and consider acquisitions to be an important component of our growth strategy. Two acquisitions that impact the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 are included below. 
ModSpace Acquisition
On August 15, 2018, WSII acquired Modular Space Holdings, Inc. ("ModSpace") for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion. ModSpace was a privately-owned provider of office trailers, portable storage units and modular buildings. WSII funded this transaction with $1.1 billion in cash raised through the issuance of the Secured Notes, the Unsecured Notes, borrowings on the ABL, and the issuance of WillScot Class A common shares and warrants to purchase WillScot Class A common shares. Results of operations from ModSpace are included in our consolidated operating results following the acquisition on August 15, 2018. Lease fleet and all other assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction are included in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.
Acton Acquisition
On December 20, 2017, WSII acquired Acton Mobile Resources Holdings LLC (“Acton Holdings”) for a cash purchase price of $237.1 million, subject to certain adjustments. Acton Holdings's subsidiary, New Acton Mobile Industries LLC (“Acton”), provided modular space and portable storage rental services from a branch network of 34 locations across the US. WSII funded the acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings under our $1.425 billion senior secured revolving credit facility (the "ABL Facility"). Results of operations from Acton are included in our consolidated operating results following the acquisition on December 20, 2017. Lease fleet and all other assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction are included in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had over 2,000 employees and had collective bargaining agreements in portions of our Mexico-based operations representing approximately 1% of our employees. Approximately 88% of our employees are in the field, while 12% serve in corporate functions. We have not experienced a strike or significant work stoppage, and we consider our relations with employees to be good. 
Intellectual Property
We own a number of trademarks, none of which are individually material to our business. Our trademarks are registered or pending applications for registrations in the US Patent and Trademark Office and various non-US jurisdictions. We operate primarily under the WillScot brand.
Regulatory and Environmental Compliance
We are subject to certain environmental, transportation, anti-corruption, import controls, health and safety and other laws and regulations in countries, states or provinces, and localities in which we operate. The business incurs significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations. However, from time to time we may be subject to additional costs and penalties as a result of non-compliance. The discovery of currently unknown matters or conditions, new laws and regulations or different enforcement or interpretation of existing laws and regulations could materially harm our business or operations in the future.
We are subject to laws and regulations that govern and impose liability for activities which may have adverse environmental effects, including discharges into air and water, and handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. As of the date of this filing, no environmental matter has been material to our operations. Based on our management’s assessment, we believe that any environmental matters relating to us of which we are currently aware will not be material to our overall business or financial condition.
The jurisdictions in which we operate are also subject to anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”). These regulations prevent companies and their officers, employees and agents from making payments to officials and public entities of foreign countries to facilitate obtaining new contracts. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal sanctions and significant monetary penalties.
A portion of our units are subject to regulation in certain states under motor vehicle and similar registrations and certificate of title statutes. Management believes that we have complied, in all material respects, with all motor vehicle registration and similar certificate of title statutes in states where such statutes clearly apply to modular space units. We have not taken actions under such statutes in states where we have determined that such statutes do not apply to modular space units. However, in certain states, the applicability of such statutes to modular space units is not clear beyond doubt. If additional registration and related requirements are deemed to be necessary in such states or if the laws in such states or other states were to change to require us to comply with such requirements, we could be subject to additional costs, fees and taxes as well as administrative burdens in order to comply with such statutes and requirements. Management does not believe that the effect of such compliance will be material to our business and financial condition.
