 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 ﻿
 Overview
 ﻿
 Frontdoor is the largest provider of home service plans in the United States, as measured by revenue, and operates under the American Home Shield, HSA, OneGuard and Landmark brands. Our home service plans help our customers maintain their homes and protect against costly and unexpected breakdowns of essential home systems and appliances. We maintain close and frequent contact with our customers as we respond to over four million homeowner service requests annually (or one every eight seconds on average) utilizing our nationwide network of over 16,000 pre-qualified professional contractor firms. Our value proposition to our professional contractor network is providing them access to our significant work volume, increasing their business activity while enhancing their ability to manage their financial and human capital resources. We realize significant economies of scale as a result of our volume of service requests and we intend to leverage our advanced customer and contractor-centric technology platform, expanding independent contractor network, existing customer base, purchasing power for replacement parts, appliances and home systems and extensive history and deep understanding of the home services market to generate sustained growth of our core home service plan business as well as to develop a new on-demand home services business.
 ﻿
 We serve over two million customers annually across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our home service plan customers subscribe to a yearly service plan agreement that covers the repair or replacement of major components of up to 21 home systems and appliances, including electrical, plumbing, central HVAC systems, water heaters, refrigerators, dishwashers and ranges/ovens/cooktops. Product failures can pose significant emotional and financial challenges for our customers as these items tend to be the most critical and complicated items in a home. Given the potentially high cost of a major appliance or home system breakdown, the cumbersome process of vetting and hiring a qualified repair professional and, typically, the lack of formal guarantee for services performed, our customers place high value on the peace of mind, convenience, repair expertise and service guarantee our home service plans deliver. As homes become increasingly complex and connected, our ability to innovate, both through upgraded product offerings and through channel diversification, has allowed us to grow the home service plan category as well as our share of that category.
 ﻿
 Our service plans appeal to the growing category of U.S. homeowners who seek financial protection against unexpected and expensive home repairs and/or the convenience of having a single home service provider that delivers pre-qualified, experienced professionals and service guarantees. Our multi-faceted value proposition resonates with a broad customer demographic, regardless of home price, income level, geographic location, or age. We acquire our customers through our partner real estate brokers and directly by advertising and marketing through our direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channel. As a result of our strong customer value proposition, 66 percent of our revenue in 2018 was recurring, in line with historical averages, driving consistency and predictability in our revenues. In addition, a significant majority of our home service plan customers automatically renew on an annual basis.
 ﻿
 From 2013 to 2018, our network of high-quality, pre-qualified professional contractor firms has grown from approximately 10,000 to over 16,000, all of which have performed a service order for us in the past 12 months. We are highly selective with onboarding new contractor firms into our service network and continuously monitor service quality through a set of rigorous performance measures, relying heavily on direct customer feedback. We are more than four times larger than the next largest provider of home service plans in the United States, as measured by revenue. We believe our scale affords us significant competitive advantages, as it would require substantial time and monetary investment to develop a comparable contractor base with national reach, experience and service excellence. We classify a subset of our independent contractor network as “preferred,” representing firms that meet our highest quality standards and are often long-tenured providers with us. Historically, approximately 80 percent of work orders are completed by our preferred contractor network, driving higher customer satisfaction and retention rates. We intend to leverage our leading contractor base to expand into home improvement and maintenance services through both our home service plans and future on-demand services.
 ﻿
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,258 million, $125 million and $238 million, respectively. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see "Item 6. Selected Financial Data".

      Our Opportunity 
 ﻿
 Frontdoor operates within the $400 billion U.S. home services market, of which the U.S. home service plan category currently represents $2.4 billion. We view increased penetration of the U.S. home service plan category as a long-term growth opportunity. This category is currently characterized by low household penetration with approximately five million of nearly 120 million U.S. households (owner-occupied homes and rentals), or approximately four percent, covered by a home service plan. In addition, we believe that increasingly complex home systems and appliances, as well as consumer preference for budget protection and convenience, will emphasize the value proposition of pre-qualified professional repair services and, accordingly, the coverage benefits offered by a home service plan.
 ﻿
 We also believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on our leading position in the home service plan category to provide services to consumers in the broader home services segment. As consumer demand shifts towards more convenient, outsourced services, we believe we have an opportunity as a reliable, scaled service provider with a national, licensed independent contractor network to expand into on-demand services.
 ﻿
 Our marketplace-based approach to home service delivery requires us to continue to grow our supply side, and we remain committed to attracting high-quality independent contractors to our network of professional service providers. As we continue to scale our contractor network, we in turn expand our breadth of potential services and enhance our ability to execute an on-demand service delivery model.
 ﻿
 Our Competitive Strengths
 ﻿
 We believe the following competitive strengths have been instrumental to our success and position us for future growth:
 ﻿
 Leader in Large, Fragmented and Growing Category. We are the leader in the U.S. home service plan category. We are more than four times larger than the next largest provider of home service plans in the United States, as measured by revenue. Over the past four decades, we have developed a marketplace reputation built on the strength of our brands, our customer and contractor value proposition and our service quality. As a result, we enjoy industry-leading brand awareness and a reputation for high-quality customer service, both of which are key drivers of the success of our customer acquisition and retention efforts. Our size and scale provide us with a competitive advantage in contractor selection and purchasing power for replacement parts, appliances and home systems, as well as the ability to extract marketing and operating efficiencies compared to smaller local and regional competitors.
 ﻿
 High-Value Service Offerings. We provide our customers with a compelling value proposition by offering financial protection against unexpected and expensive home repairs, coupled with the convenience of having repairs completed quickly and by experienced professionals. In contrast with insurance products that have low frequency of use, we pay claims on behalf of our home service plan customers more than once per year, on average. We believe this high level of engagement reinforces our customer value proposition and leads to higher renewal rates. We believe our annual customer retention rate is further evidence of the value our customers place on our service and the quality of execution that we provide.
 ﻿
 Technology-Enabled Platform Drives Efficiency and Quality of Service. We are focused on constantly improving the customer and contractor experience. We continuously develop and refine our advanced customer- and contractor-centric technology platform to enhance the experience for our customers, our contractors and our partner real estate brokers and agents. Our platform allows customers to purchase and utilize a home service plan, electronically chat with a representative, pay bills and track the progress of their service requests, all from their mobile device or personal computer. Our contractors use this platform to interact with us and to more efficiently and effectively serve our customers. In addition, real estate brokers utilize our platform to facilitate the purchase of home service plans. We believe our technology-enabled platform provides a foundation for operational and customer service excellence, ultimately driving customer retention and contractor growth.
 ﻿
 Multi-Channel Sales and Marketing Approach Supported by Sophisticated Customer Analytics. Our multi-channel sales and marketing approach is designed to understand the key decision points that our customers face during the purchase of home services to generate revenue and build brand value.
 ﻿
 In the real estate channel, we leverage marketing service agreements and a team of field-based account executives to train, educate and market our plans through real estate brokers and agents at both a local and national level. We have long-standing strategic relationships with seven of the top ten real estate brokers in the United States and we view these strategic relationships as a key competitive advantage.
 ﻿

      In the DTC channel, lead generation has benefited from increased and more efficient marketing spending as well as improved digital marketing. Our internal testing demonstrates that a customer’s intent to purchase a home service plan increases by approximately two times after being presented with a basic description of how our home service plans work. We increasingly utilize sophisticated consumer analytics models that allow us to more effectively segment our prospective customers and deliver tailored marketing campaigns. In addition, we have deployed more sophisticated marketing tools to attract customers, including content marketing, online reputation management and social media channels. The effectiveness of our marketing efforts is demonstrated by our ability to generate quality leads and online sales on a cost-effective basis.
 ﻿
 Diverse, Recurring and Stable Revenue Streams. We are diversified by customer acquisition channel and by geography, with operations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Customers acquired through the real estate channel and DTC channel represented 47 percent and 53 percent, respectively, of our customer base in 2018. We believe our ability to acquire customers through the DTC channel mitigates the effect of potential cyclicality in the home resale market and our nationwide presence limits the impact of poor economic conditions or adverse weather conditions in any particular geography. We benefit from predictable and recurring revenue as our customers sign twelve-month contracts and 66 percent of our revenue was generated through existing customer renewals in 2018, in line with historical averages. In addition, our business model has proven resilient through various business cycles as evidenced by our growth each year during the 2008 financial downturn and compound annual revenue growth rate of approximately four percent from 2007 to 2011 and approximately nine percent from 2011 to 2018.
 ﻿
 Capital-Light Business Model.  Our business model generates strong Adjusted EBITDA margins and negative working capital and requires limited capital expenditures. As such, we have a capital-light business model that drives potential for strong generation of cash flow. We may, from time to time, make more significant investments in capability-expanding technology, including investments to develop a world-class data platform to fuel our growth. Net cash provided from operating activities was $189 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $194 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $155 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Free Cash Flow was $163 million, $179 million and $144 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided from operating activities, see “Item 6. Selected Financial Data.”
 ﻿
 Experienced Management Team. We have a management team of highly experienced leaders who have strong track records in a wide variety of industries and economic conditions. Our management team is highly focused on execution and driving growth and profitability, and, as such, our compensation structure is tied to key performance metrics that are designed to incentivize senior management to drive the long-term success of our business. Our chief executive officer brings direct experience from industry-leading companies like Lyft and Amazon. He is well versed in scaling large businesses, leveraging technology to innovate and grow and building on-demand marketplaces. Our chief financial officer has over 20 years as a finance executive and six years with our core business, bringing deep industry insights, continuity and financial acumen. We believe our management team has the vision and experience to position us for continued success and to implement and execute our business strategies over the long term. Further, we believe that we have a deep pool of talent across our organization, including long-tenured individuals with significant expertise, knowledge of our business and experience building and scaling technology-enabled businesses.
 ﻿
 Our Business Strategies
 ﻿
 We intend to profitably grow our business by:
 ﻿
 Increasing Our Home Service Plan Penetration
 ﻿
 Between 2012 and 2018, we increased our share of home service plan category revenue while the overall size of the home service plan category increased from approximately three million to five million households over the same period. We intend to further increase our home service plan penetration by making strategic investments to educate consumers on our compelling value proposition, target homeowners more effectively, further improve the customer experience and attract new real estate brokers and contractors. In addition, we see an opportunity to expand our repair services to property managers who currently use our services through individual home service plans by helping them aggregate such plans and better manage their utilization of our services.
 ﻿
 Deliver Superior Customer Experience. We will continue to improve the customer experience by investing in our integrated technology platform, self-service capabilities, business intelligence platforms, customer care center operations and contractor management systems. These targeted investments are expected to result in an enhanced customer experience by providing a more convenient service and improving contractor efficiencies and engagement. We believe these initiatives will lead to improved retention rates, more grassroots marketing and the opportunity to deliver additional services to satisfied customers.
 ﻿
 Grow Our Supply Network of Independent Contractors. We will continue to grow our network of pre-qualified professional contractor firms while maintaining the high quality of our network. Our contractor relations team utilizes a highly selective process to choose new contractor firms and continuously monitors their service quality. We believe growing our contractor base within existing service locations and in new geographies, while maintaining service excellence, will drive further penetration of our home service plans and differentiate our product offering relative to competitors.

      Continue Digital Innovation. We are continuing to invest in digital innovation to further increase the ease-of-use of our technology platform for customers, contractors and realtors. In recent years, we have developed robust customer technology platforms, which make it easy for customers to purchase from us, request service and manage their account from the convenience of a smartphone or tablet. Our contractor technology platform makes it easier for contractors to work with us and improves communication between contractors and our customers. Our realtor technology platform makes it easier for realtors to work with us and therefore recommend our products to their clients. Approximately 55 percent of real estate channel orders were placed online in 2018. As we continue to make investments in digital innovation, these enhanced digital platforms will be the foundation of both our home service plan and future on-demand businesses.
 ﻿
 Develop Dynamic Pricing. We are currently testing improvements to our customer acquisition and retention efforts through the development of dynamic pricing capabilities. This capability will leverage our proprietary data platform to allow us to adjust our plan prices based on factors such as the strength of our contractor network in a market, the grade of appliances in a home or neighborhood and the labor costs within a market. We expect to utilize these capabilities to improve the profitability of higher risk customers, while offering more attractive prices to lower risk and price-sensitive customers.
 ﻿
 Expanding into Home Maintenance and Improvement Services
 ﻿
 We intend to continue to leverage our existing sales channels and service platform to deliver additional value-added services to our customers by expanding beyond repair services to offer home maintenance and improvement services. Repair services only comprise approximately 25 percent of the U.S. home services market, and home improvement and maintenance work is highly valued by our contractors. Our product development teams draw upon the experience of technicians in the field to both create innovative customer solutions for the existing product suite and identify service and category adjacencies. For example, we are currently piloting a new maintenance service offering of central HVAC pre-season checkups, which we expect to launch nationwide in 2019. In the real estate channel, we have recently launched a successful nationwide service offering of re-keying locks for recent home buyers with a home service plan. We are also testing smart home technology services, which we believe will add value to our plans and result in increases in renewals. We believe these new service offerings will lead to higher customer engagement, ultimately leading to stronger customer loyalty.
 ﻿
 Providing Customers Access to Our High-Quality, Pre-Qualified Network of Contractors for On-Demand Home Services
 ﻿
 We see a significant opportunity to leverage our existing contractor base to develop on-demand home repair, maintenance and improvement services, which we believe will increase our customer satisfaction and contractor value proposition and provide us with additional revenue opportunities. By offering on-demand services, we can provide additional services to our existing home service plan customers and reach new customers, including those not currently interested in home service plans. The home service plan category currently consists of five million homes, while the market for on-demand home services is approximately 120 million homes. We are evolving with our customers’ ever-changing preferences, including demand for new services and how those services are solicited and procured. For homeowners, we can provide benefits from our economies of scale and preferred rates, access to our network of high-quality, pre-qualified contractors, pricing data, transparency and real-time tracking of service requests that they may not get from going direct to a contractor. For contractors, we can provide actual revenue opportunities (not just leads), access to our preferred pricing for replacement parts, appliances and home systems, as well as access to our scheduling services. We also believe that our on-demand services offering will strengthen our core home service plan business by highlighting the value proposition of our services and the convenience of our vast contractor network to new customers. We intend to launch our on-demand business with repair services and then expand into maintenance and improvement services. We initially plan to market our on-demand service to our 2.1 million existing home service plan customers and then expand into additional marketing channels. We intend to pilot our on-demand services in the second half of 2019 and begin expanding their scale in 2020.
 ﻿
 Developing a World-Class Data Platform
 ﻿
 We believe we have the opportunity to become the authoritative source of home service information. Since our founding in 1971, we have amassed a significant amount of data on historic maintenance trends, recall and repair history and parts and labor pricing for most home repairs. We are constantly analyzing and using our data to make better business decisions and improve visibility on future costs. We also intend to identify additional opportunities to use technology to capture valuable home data, making it easier for customers and contractors to interact and ultimately enable us to anticipate repair needs. We intend for this aggregated data platform to be the definitive source of information for homeowners to understand contractor quality and service trends in order to make informed decisions on how to maintain, improve or repair their home. We believe these investments will both improve the customer experience and reduce our operating expenses. We also believe this data platform will provide additional revenue opportunities as real estate companies, manufacturers and other companies recognize the benefit of this aggregated data.

      Pursuing Selective Acquisitions
 ﻿
 We have a track record of sourcing and purchasing targets at attractive prices and successfully integrating them into our business. In 2016, we made two key acquisitions. In June 2016, we acquired OneGuard Home Warranties (“OneGuard”), and in November 2016, we acquired Landmark Home Warranty, LLC (“Landmark”), which together added over 100,000 new customers. We anticipate that the highly fragmented nature of the home service plan industry will continue to create strategic opportunities for further consolidation, and, with our scale, we believe we will be the acquirer of choice in the industry. In particular, we intend to focus strategically on underserved regions where we can enhance and expand service capabilities. Historically, we have used acquisitions to cost-effectively grow our customer base in high-growth geographies and we intend to continue to do so. We may also explore opportunities to make strategic acquisitions that will expand our service offering in the broader home services segment.
 ﻿
 Sales and Marketing
 ﻿
 We market our services to homeowners on a national and local level through various means, including marketing partnerships, search engine marketing, content marketing, social media, direct mail, television and radio, print advertisements and telemarketing. We partner with various participants in the residential real estate marketplace, such as real estate brokers and insurance carriers, to market and sell our home service plans. In addition, we sell through our customer care centers, mobile-optimized e-commerce platform and national sales teams. Our marketing spend in 2018 was composed of digital (44 percent), direct (21 percent), broadcast (18 percent) and social media and other (17 percent). We utilize the following customer acquisition channels:
 ﻿
 Real estate channel. Our plans have historically been used to provide peace of mind to home buyers by protecting them from large, unanticipated out-of-pocket expenses related to the breakdown of major home systems and appliances during the first year after a home purchase. We leverage marketing service agreements and a team of over 150 field-based account executives and sales leaders who focus on a defined geographic area to train and educate real estate brokers and agents within their territory about the benefits of a home service plan and those brokers and agents then market our plans to home buyers. Our field-based account executives work directly with real estate offices and participate in broker meetings and national sales events. In addition to our field-based account executives, we have nine account managers who operate out of a customer care center and a team of seven providing sales and marketing support.
 ﻿
 We have long-standing relationships with seven of the top ten real estate brokers in the United States and continue to improve relationships with other key brokers. On average, we have been in business with these real estate brokers for 17 years, and we have strategic partnership arrangements with many of these brokers. Our long-standing relationships help to secure and grow our position. In addition, for 16 years running, we have had a strategic alliance agreement with the National Association of Realtors, which is the largest real estate association in the United States representing approximately 1.3 million realtors.
 ﻿
 We had a 33 percent share of plans sold in connection with a home resale transaction in 2018, up from 26 percent in 2012. In 2018, 1.5 million homes were sold with a home service plan out of the approximately 5.3 million homes sold. Customers acquired through the real estate channel represented 47 percent of our customer base in 2018, down from 56 percent in 2007, as we have rapidly grown our DTC customer base. In 2018, customers in this channel renewed at 29 percent after the first contract year. Revenue from this channel, including associated renewals, was $578 million, $533 million and $449 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Overall revenues within this channel have grown at a five percent CAGR from 2007 through 2018.
 ﻿
 Direct-to-consumer channel. Leveraging our experience in the real estate channel, we invested significant resources to develop the DTC channel to broaden our reach beyond home resale transactions. Our value proposition resonates with a wide demographic of homeowners who find security in a plan protecting against expensive and unexpected breakdowns in the home. This strong value proposition is promoted to our potential customers through search engine marketing, content marketing, social media, direct mail, television and radio, print advertisements and telemarketing and sold through our customer care centers and mobile-optimized e-commerce platform. Over the past decade, we have strategically invested to expand the DTC channel given its high retention rates and customer lifetime value. Our research indicates a relatively low home service plan penetration rate of four percent of occupied U.S. households. We believe that penetration rates will increase over time as consumers become more aware of, and educated about, home service plans.
 ﻿
 Since 2012, we have maintained an over 50 percent share of home service plans purchased or renewed outside of a home resale transaction. This industry remains underpenetrated, with approximately three million homes out of the 115 million U.S. households (excluding home resales) having a home service plan. Customers acquired through the DTC channel represented 53 percent of our customer base in 2018, up from 44 percent in 2007. In 2018, customers in this channel renewed at 76 percent after the first contract year. Revenue from this channel, including associated renewals, was $674 million, $618 million and $571 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Overall revenues within this channel have grown at a nine percent CAGR from 2007 through 2018.
 ﻿

      Customer renewals. We generated 66 percent of our revenue through existing customer renewals for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our customer retention rate has grown from 73 percent in 2007 to 75 percent in 2018. We have made significant investments in our integrated technology platform, self-service capabilities, customer care center operations and contractor management systems, which we believe position us to further improve retention. We estimate that each one-percent improvement in customer retention generates approximately $8 million of incremental revenue and $4 million of gross profit.
 ﻿
 Customers, Contractors, Suppliers and Geographies
 ﻿
 Customers. As our customers are predominantly owners of single-family residences, we do not have significant customer concentration. We had 2.1 million, 2.0 million and 1.9 million customers as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 67 percent of our customers are on a monthly auto-pay program. Auto-pay customers are more likely to renew than non-auto-pay customers.
 ﻿
 Contractors. We have a network of over 16,000 high-quality, pre-qualified professional contractor firms that employ more than 45,000 technicians. The qualification process for a contractor includes assessing their online presence and customer reviews, gathering public information about the company, reviewing references from customers and other contractors, and confirming they meet all insurance and licensing standards. In addition, contractors must agree to our service requirements, such as timely appointments and follow-ups with all customers, guaranteed work, professionalism, and availability. Our contractors are supported by a designated contractor relations representative who guides them through the process of working with us, from on-boarding, to the first service call to continuous monitoring and training. No contractor accounted for more than five percent of our cost of services rendered. We estimate that approximately 95 percent of our contractor base plans to maintain or expand their relationship with us over the next two years.
 ﻿
 Suppliers. We are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for various key components used in the services and products we offer to customers, and the cost, quality and availability of these components are essential to our services. Supplier spend made up approximately 20 percent of our cost of services rendered in 2018, and we have multiple national supplier agreements in place. We have five national suppliers of repair parts and home systems and appliances that each account for more than five percent of our supplier spend.
 ﻿
 Geographies. A significant percentage of our revenue is concentrated in the southern and western regions of the United States, including California, Texas, Florida and Arizona.
 ﻿
 Technology
 ﻿
 We are continuing to invest in digital innovation to further increase the ease-of-use of our technology platform for customers, contractors and realtors.
 ﻿
 Customers. In recent years, we have developed robust customer technology platforms, which make it easy for customers to purchase from us, request service and manage their account from the convenience of a smartphone or tablet. Approximately 40 percent of our DTC sales in 2018 were entered online, and 55 percent of our total service request volume was entered online or through our interactive voice response system. Our customer MyAccount platform had over one million active users at the end of 2018, allowing customers to pay bills, request service, review account information or chat with a representative online without having to call our customer care centers.
 ﻿
 Contractors. Our contractor technology platform makes it easier for contractors to work with us and improves communication between contractors and our customers. Our contractor portal had nearly 6,500 active users at the end of 2018, and our platform sent nearly 1.4 million “On-My-Way” notifications to customers, letting them know their contractor was en route to their home.
 ﻿
 Realtors. Our realtor technology platform makes it easier for realtors to work with us, and therefore recommend our products to their clients. Approximately 55 percent of real estate channel orders were placed online in 2018. Our realtor portal had over 80,000 active users at the end of 2018, allowing realtors to enter, edit and pay for orders; view or print order confirmations, invoices, and contracts for active customers; request service on behalf of their clients; and view and manage expiring orders.

      Competition
 ﻿
 We compete in the home service plan industry and the broader U.S. home services market. The home service plan industry is a highly competitive industry. The principal methods of competition, and by which we differentiate ourselves from our competitors, are quality and speed of service, contract offerings, brand awareness and reputation, customer satisfaction, pricing and promotions, contractor network and referrals. While we compete with a broad range of competitors in each locality and region, we are the only home service plan company providing home service plans in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our primary direct competitors are First American Home Warranty Corporation and Old Republic Home Protection. We also compete in the broader home services market with HomeAdvisor (who also recently acquired Angie’s List) and HomeServe. We believe our network of over 16,000 pre-qualified professional contractor firms, in combination with our large base of contracted customers, differentiates us from other platforms in the home services market.
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,200 employees, none of whom is represented by labor unions.
 ﻿
 Intellectual Property
 ﻿
 We hold various service marks, trademarks and trade names, such as Frontdoor and American Home Shield, that we deem particularly important to our advertising and marketing activities.
 ﻿
 Insurance
 ﻿
 We maintain insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate for our business, including workers’ compensation, auto liability, general liability, umbrella, cybersecurity and property insurance. In addition, we provide insurance for our service requests in Texas via our wholly-owned captive insurance company, which is domiciled in Houston, Texas.
 ﻿
 Regulatory Compliance
 ﻿
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, compliance with which increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the services we provide or the methods by which we may offer, sell and fulfill those services or conduct our business, or subjects us to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to fines, loss of licenses or registrations or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 ﻿
 These federal, state and local laws and regulations include laws relating to consumer protection, deceptive trade practices, home service plans, real estate settlement, wage and hour requirements, state contractor laws, the employment of immigrants, labor relations, licensing, building code requirements, workers’ safety, environmental, privacy and data protection, securities, insurance coverages, sales tax collection and remittance, healthcare reforms, employee benefits, marketing (including, without limitation, telemarketing) and advertising. In addition, we are regulated in certain states by the applicable state insurance regulatory authority and by other regulatory bodies, such as the Real Estate Commission in Texas.
 ﻿
 We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect consumers, including laws governing consumer privacy and fraud, the collection and use of consumer data, telemarketing and other forms of solicitation. The telemarketing rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission pursuant to the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Telemarketing Sales Rule issued by the Federal Trade Commission govern our telephone sales practices. In addition, some states and local governing bodies have adopted laws and regulations targeted at direct telephone sales, i.e., “do-not-call” regulations. The implementation of these marketing regulations requires us to rely more extensively on other marketing methods and channels. In addition, if we were to fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, we could be subject to substantial fines or damages, be involved in lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities, suffer losses to our reputation and our business or suffer the loss of licenses or registrations or incur penalties that may affect how the business is operated, any of which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
