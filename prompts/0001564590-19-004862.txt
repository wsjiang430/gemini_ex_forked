ITEM 1.  
BUSINESS
 General
 PotlatchDeltic Corporation, formerly known as Potlatch Corporation and also formerly known as Potlatch Holdings, Inc., was incorporated in Delaware in September 2005 to facilitate a restructuring to qualify for treatment as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for federal income tax purposes. It is the successor to the business of the original Potlatch Corporation, which was incorporated in Maine in 1903. References herein to Potlatch, refer to Potlatch Corporation prior to the Deltic merger described below.
 On February 20, 2018 (merger date), Deltic Timber Corporation (Deltic) merged into Portland Merger, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Potlatch. Following the merger Potlatch changed its name to PotlatchDeltic Corporation.  Deltic owned approximately 530,000 acres of timberland, operated two sawmills and a medium density fiberboard facility and engaged in real estate development primarily in central Arkansas. The merger uniquely positions us to expand our integrated model of timberland ownership and lumber manufacturing, provide tax savings on Deltic’s timber harvest earnings and increase our exposure to the Texas housing market.  Under the merger agreement, each issued and outstanding share of Deltic common stock was exchanged for 1.80 shares of Potlatch common stock, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares. 
 On December 20, 2018 we entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement with Roseburg Forest Products Co. to sell the medium density fiberboard facility (MDF facility) we acquired through the Deltic merger.  The sale closed on February 12, 2019. At December 31, 2018 the MDF facility was classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3: Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the sale.
 We are a leading timberland REIT with operations in seven states where we own approximately 1.9 million acres of timberland.  We own six sawmills, an industrial grade plywood mill and real estate development projects primarily in central Arkansas.
 We are focused on the ownership of timberland, which we view as a unique and attractive asset due to the renewable nature of timber resources and timber’s long-term history of price appreciation in excess of inflation. Our primary objectives include using our timberland investments to generate income and maximizing the long-term value of our assets. We pursue these objectives by adhering to the following strategies: 
  
• | Managing our timberlands to improve their long-term sustainable yield. We manage our timberlands in a manner designed to optimize the balance among timber growth, prudent environmental management and current cash flow, in order to achieve increasing levels of sustainable yield over the long-term. We may choose to harvest timber at levels above or below our current estimate of sustainability for short periods of time, for the purpose of improving the long-term productivity of certain timber stands or in response to market conditions. In addition, we focus on optimizing timber returns by continually improving productivity and yields through advanced silvicultural practices that take into account soil, climate and biological considerations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing attractive acquisitions. We actively pursue timberland acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic criteria. The critical elements of our acquisition strategy generally include acquiring properties that complement our existing land base, are cash flow accretive and have attractive timber or higher and better use (HBU) values.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximizing the value of our timberland real estate. A portion of our acreage is more valuable for recreational purposes or to other timberland or real estate investors. We continually assess the potential uses of our lands and manage them proactively for the highest value. We have identified approximately 12% of our timberlands as having values that are potentially greater than timberland values.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Practicing sound environmental stewardship. We pursue a program of environmental stewardship and active involvement in federal, state and local policymaking to maximize our assets’ long-term value. We manage our timberlands in a manner consistent with the principles set forth by SFI® or FSC®.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our businesses are organized into three operating segments:
  
• | Resource: Our Resource segment manages our timberlands to optimize revenue producing opportunities while adhering to our strict stewardship standards. Management activities include planting and harvesting trees and building and maintaining roads. The Resource segment also generates revenues from activities such as hunting leases, recreation permits and leases, mineral rights leases, biomass production and carbon sequestration.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wood Products: Our Wood Products segment manufactures and sells lumber, plywood and residual products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Real Estate: Our Real Estate segment consists primarily of sales of rural real property deemed non-strategic or identified as having higher and better use alternatives and real estate development and subdivision activity through PotlatchDeltic’s taxable REIT subsidiaries (PotlatchDeltic TRS).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additional information regarding each of our operating segments is included in this section, as well as in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 21: Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal and state corporate income taxes on our income from investments in real estate that we distribute to our stockholders, including the income derived from the sale of standing timber. We are required to pay federal corporate income taxes on income from our non-real estate investments, principally the operations of PotlatchDeltic TRS. 
 Deltic’s REIT qualifying activities were also not subject to federal and state corporate income taxes commencing on the date of the merger. We are, however, subject to corporate taxes on built-in gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis on the merger date) on sales of former Deltic real property held by the REIT during the five years following the Deltic merger. The sale of standing timber is not subject to built-in gains tax.

Business Segments
 Resource Segment
 Industry Background. The demand for timber depends primarily upon the markets for wood related products, including lumber, panel products, paper and other pulp-based products. The end uses for timber vary widely, depending on species, size and quality. Historically, timber demand has experienced cyclical fluctuations, although sometimes at different times and rates for products or geographic regions. The demand for sawlogs, lumber and other manufactured wood products is significantly dependent upon the level of new residential construction and remodeling activity, which, in turn, is affected by general economic and demographic factors, including population growth, new household formations, interest rates for home mortgages and construction loans and credit availability. Increases in residential construction and remodeling activities are generally followed by higher lumber prices, which are usually followed by higher log prices. The demand for pulpwood is dependent on the paper and pulp-based manufacturing industries. Both pulpwood and sawlogs are affected by domestic and international economic conditions, global population growth and other demographic factors, industry capacity and the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to foreign currencies. Locally, timber demand and pricing also fluctuates due to the expansion or closure of individual wood products and pulp-based manufacturing facilities.
 Timber supplies can fluctuate depending upon factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies, as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to storm damage, unusual pest infestations such as the mountain pine beetle, or fires. Local timber supplies also change in response to prevailing timber prices. Rising timber prices often lead to increased harvesting on private timberlands, including lands not 
 4


previously made available for commercial timber operations. The supply of timber generally is adequate to meet demand, although this could tighten in the event of higher demand due to increased United States (U.S.) housing starts, increased log and lumber exports and the impacts from a natural disaster, such as fire, hurricane, earthquake, insect infestation, drought, disease, ice storms, windstorms, flooding or other factors.
 Timberland Sale. On April 21, 2016, we sold approximately 172,000 acres of timberlands located in central Idaho for $114 million. We purchased the property in 2007 and 2008 for the purpose of growing and harvesting timber and selling rural recreational parcels. The sale freed up capital without having to wait for the rural recreational real estate market in central Idaho to recover. Historical earnings generated by the property were positive, but not material.
 Ownership. The Resource segment manages approximately 1.9 million acres of timberlands including approximately 19,000 acres under long-term leases. We are the largest private landowner in Idaho and second largest in Arkansas. The following table provides additional information about our timberlands.

(Acres in thousands) | | | 
---------------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------
Region | State | Description | Acres | 
Northern region | Idaho | Variety of commercially viable softwood species, such as grand fir, Douglas fir and inland red cedar | | 629 
 | Minnesota | Primarily pine, aspen and hardwoods | | 125 
 | | Total Northern region | | 754 
Southern region | Arkansas | Primarily southern yellow pine and hardwoods | | 932 
 | Mississippi | Primarily southern yellow pine and hardwoods | | 96 
 | Alabama | Primarily southern yellow pine and hardwoods | | 92 
 | Louisiana | Primarily southern yellow pine and hardwoods | | 7 
 | | Total Southern region | | 1,127
 | | Total | | 1,881

Operation. The primary business of the Resource segment is the management of our timberlands to optimize the value of all possible revenue producing opportunities while adhering to our strict stewardship standards. Management activities include planting and harvesting trees and building and maintaining roads. The segment also generates revenue from non-timber resources such as from hunting leases, recreation permits and leases, mineral rights leases, biomass production and carbon sequestration.
 We strive to maximize cash flow while managing our timberlands sustainably over the long-term. From time to time, we may choose, within the parameters of our environmental commitments, to harvest timber at levels above or below our estimate of sustainability for short periods in order to take advantage of strong demand or to adjust to weak demand. To maximize our timberlands' long-term value, we manage them intensively, based upon timber species and local growing conditions. Our harvest plans take into account changing market conditions, are designed to contribute to the growth of the remaining timber and reflect our policy of environmental stewardship. We reforest our acreage in a timely fashion to enhance its long-term value. We employ silvicultural techniques to improve timber growth rates, including vegetation control, fertilization and thinning. In deciding whether to implement any silvicultural practice, we analyze the associated costs and long-term benefits, with the goal of achieving an attractive return over time.
 Inventory. At the end of 2018, our estimated standing merchantable timber inventory was approximately 88 million tons, including approximately 34 million tons in the North and approximately 54 million tons in the South. At the end of 2017, our estimated standing merchantable timber inventory was approximately 64 million tons. The increase in standing merchantable timber inventory from 2017 was primarily attributable to the addition of the Deltic timberlands. 
 The aggregate estimated volume of current standing merchantable timber inventory is updated annually to reflect increases due to reclassification of young growth to merchantable timber when the young growth meets defined diameter specifications, the annual growth rates of merchantable timber and the acquisition of additional merchantable timber and to reflect decreases due to timber harvests and land sales. This estimate is derived using methods consistent with industry practice and is based on statistical methods and field sampling. The estimated inventory volume includes timber in environmentally sensitive areas where the timberlands are 
 5


managed in a manner consistent with best management practices, state forest practice acts and the SFI® or FSC® forest management standards.
 Timber volumes are estimated from cruises of the timber tracts, which are generally completed on a five to ten year cycle. Since the individual cruises collect field data at different times for specific sites, the growth model projects standing inventory from the cruise date to a common reporting date. Annual growth rates for the merchantable inventory have historically been in the range of 2% to 5% in the North and 6% to 9% in the South.
 Harvest. Our short-term and long-term harvest plans are critical factors in our long-term management process. Each year, we prepare a harvest plan designating the timber tracts and volumes to be harvested during that particular year. Each harvest plan reflects our analysis of the age, size and species distribution of our timber, as well as our expectations about harvest methods, growth rates, the volume of each species to be harvested, anticipated acquisitions and dispositions, thinning operations, regulatory constraints and other relevant information. Among other things, the optimal harvest cycles, or rotations, for timber vary by location and species and tend to change over time as a result of silvicultural advances, changes in the markets for different sizes and ages of timber and other factors. Since harvest plans are based on projections of weather, timber growth rates, regulatory constraints and other assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, there can be no assurance that we will be able to harvest the volumes projected or the specific timber stands designated in our harvest plans.
 Detailed harvest information by region and product is presented in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following table presents a summary of our total 2018 timber harvest by region.
 
 
 | Timber Harvested | 
--------------------+------------------+------
(Tons in thousands) | Sawlogs | | Pulpwood | | Stumpage | Total
Northern region | | 1,714 | | 147 | | 13 | 1,874
Southern region | | 1,853 | | 1,594 | | 222 | 3,669
Total | | 3,567 | | 1,741 | | 235 | 5,543

 
Based on our current projections, which are based on constant timberland holdings and take into consideration such factors as market conditions, the ages of our timber stands and recent timberland sales and acquisitions, we expect to harvest 6.0 to 6.1 million tons in 2019. 
 The Resource segment sells a portion of its logs at market prices to our Wood Products manufacturing facilities. Intersegment sales to our Wood Products manufacturing facilities were 33%, 26% and 22% of our total Resource segment revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The segment also sells sawlogs and pulpwood to a variety of forest products companies located near our timberlands. The segment’s customers range in size from small operators to multinational corporations. No customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2018.  Idaho Forest Group, LLC operates six sawmills in Idaho and represented slightly more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2017 and 2016. The segment competes with owners of timberlands that operate in areas near our timberlands, ranging from private owners of small tracts of land to some of the largest timberland companies in the United States (U.S.). The segment competes principally on the basis of distance to market, price, log quality and customer service.
 In 2018, approximately 36% of our harvest volumes were sold under log supply agreements. We expect approximately the same amount to be sold under log supply agreements in 2019. In general, our log supply agreements require a specified volume of timber to be delivered to defined customer facilities at prices that are adjusted periodically to reflect market conditions. Prices in our Northern region contracts are adjusted periodically by species to prevailing market prices for logs, lumber, wood chips and other residuals. Prices in our Southern region contracts are adjusted every three months based on prevailing market prices for logs. Typically, our log supply agreements are in place for one to five years.
 Other. Our timberlands include a wide diversity of softwood and hardwood species and are certified to either the SFI® or FSC® standards. We adhere to principles that include commitments to sustainable forestry, responsible practices, forest health and productivity and protection of special sites. We are generally able to realize price premiums for pulpwood from our FSC®-certified lands.
 Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to the environment, endangered species, our forestry activities and health and safety. Due to the significance of regulation to our business, we integrate wildlife, habitat and watershed management into our resource 
 6


management practices. We also take an active approach to regulatory developments by participating in standard-setting where possible. We work cooperatively with regulators to create voluntary conservation plans that address environmental concerns while preserving our ability to operate our timberlands efficiently. Despite our active participation in governmental policymaking and regulatory standard-setting, there can be no assurance that endangered species, environmental and other laws will not restrict our operations or impose significant costs, damages, penalties or liabilities on us. In particular, we anticipate that endangered species and environmental laws will generally become increasingly stringent.
 The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our lands may be affected by natural disasters such as fire, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, hurricanes, wind storms, floods and other weather conditions and causes. We assume substantially all risk of loss to the standing timber we own from fire and other hazards, consistent with industry practice in the United States, because insuring for such losses is not practicable.
 Wood Products Segment
 Our Wood Products segment manufactures and sells lumber, plywood and residual products at seven mills located in Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan and Minnesota. The segment’s products are largely commodity products, which are sold through our sales department to end users, retailers or wholesalers for nationwide distribution primarily for use in home building, repair and remodeling, industrial products and other construction activity.
 A description of our wood products manufacturing facilities, all of which are owned by us, together with their respective 2018 capacities are as follows:
 
 
 | Annual Capacity1,2
-------------------+-------------------
Sawmills: | 
Waldo, Arkansas3 | 285 MMBF 
Ola, Arkansas3 | 230 MMBF 
Warren, Arkansas | 220 MMBF 
St. Maries, Idaho | 185 MMBF 
Gwinn, Michigan | 185 MMBF 
Bemidji, Minnesota | 140 MMBF 
Plywood Mill: | 
St. Maries, Idaho | 150 MMSF 


1 | Capacity represents the proven annual production capabilities of the facility under normal operating conditions and producing a normal product mix. Normal operating conditions are based on the configuration, efficiency and the number of shifts worked at each individual facility. In general, the definition includes two shifts per day for five days (two 40-hour shifts) per week at each facility, which is consistent with industry-wide recognized measures. Production can exceed capacity due to efficiency gains and overtime. Actual sawmill production for 2018 was 1,019 MMBF.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2 | MMBF stands for million board feet; MMSF stands for million square feet, 3/8-inch panel thickness basis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3 | These facilities were acquired in the Deltic merger. We are in the process of determining proven annual production capabilities at these facilities and therefore amounts disclosed represent permitted production capacity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are a top 10 lumber manufacturer in the United States. We believe that competitiveness in this industry is largely based on individual mill efficiency and on the availability of competitively priced raw materials on a facility-by-facility basis, rather than the number of mills operated. This is due to the fact that it is generally not economical to transfer logs between or among facilities, which might permit a greater degree of specialization and operating efficiencies. Instead, each facility must utilize the raw materials that are available to it in a relatively limited geographic area. For these reasons, we believe we are able to compete effectively with companies that have a larger number of mills. We compete based on product quality, customer service and price. 
 The principal raw material used is logs, which are obtained from our Resource segment or purchased on the open market. We generally do not maintain long-term supply contracts for a significant volume of logs. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, 42%, 39% and 34% of our log purchases, respectively, were provided by our Resource segment.

Real Estate Segment
 The activities of our Real Estate segment consist primarily of the sale of non-core timberlands and real estate development and subdivision activity through PotlatchDeltic TRS.
 The sale of non-core timberlands are in the categories of HBU, rural recreational real estate and non-strategic properties that exhibit higher value than commercial timberlands.
  
• | HBU properties have characteristics that provide primarily home site or other development potential as a result of superior location or other attractive amenities. These properties tend to have a much higher value than timberlands.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rural recreational real estate properties also have a higher value than timberlands, but do not have the same developmental potential as HBU properties. For example, these properties may be appropriate for hunting, conservation or secondary rural housing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-strategic properties are typically on the fringe of our ownership areas and are more valuable to another timberland owner.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have identified approximately 230,000 acres of non-core timberland real estate. This includes approximately 55,000 acres of HBU property, 100,000 acres of rural recreational real estate property and 75,000 acres of non-strategic timberland. Sales of these lands are expected to occur over a decade or more. We continually assess the highest value and best use of our timberlands through periodic stratification assessments on our timberlands and as new timberlands are acquired.
 From time to time, we also take advantage of opportunities to sell timberland where we believe pricing to be particularly attractive, to match a sale with a purchase of more desirable property while deferring taxes in a like-kind exchange (LKE) transaction, or to meet various other financial or strategic objectives. Sales of conservation properties and conservation easements on our properties are also included in this segment. Results for the segment depend on the demand for our non-core timberlands, the types of properties sold, the basis of these properties and the timing of closings of property sales. Although large sales of non-strategic properties can cause results that are not comparable or predictable between periods, we have maintained a relatively consistent level of rural real estate and HBU sales. 
 The Real Estate segment also engages in real estate development and sales through PotlatchDeltic TRS.  Chenal Valley in Little Rock, Arkansas is a premier upscale planned community, with approximately 4,800 acres of residential and commercial properties centered around a country club with two championship golf courses, which we own and operate. In addition, we are developing an approximate 800-acre upscale community for residential, resort, or retirement living at Red Oak Ridge, in Hot Springs, Arkansas.   
 For these properties, we develop and market residential lots and commercial sites and sell undeveloped acreage. Residential lots are sold to homebuilders and individuals, while commercial sites are sold to developers and businesses. Infrastructure and other improvements to support the development and sale of residential and commercial properties are provided and funded directly by us or in some circumstances, through real property improvement districts. Such properties are developed only when sufficient demand exists and substantially all infrastructure is completed. Future infrastructure investments are primarily for the development and sale of additional property. Most of the infrastructure is in place for Chenal Valley. Our competitors in our real estate markets are other landowners or developers.  
 Seasonality
 Log and pulpwood sales volumes in our Resource segment are typically lower in the first half of each year as winter rains in the Southern region and spring thaw in the Northern region limit timber harvesting operations due to softened roadbeds and wet logging conditions that restrict access to logging sites. The third quarter is typically our Resource segment's strongest production quarter. Real Estate dispositions and acquisitions can be adversely affected when access to any properties to be sold or considered for acquisition are limited due to adverse weather conditions. Demand for our manufactured wood products typically decreases in the winter months when construction activity is slower, while demand typically increases during the spring, summer and fall when 
 8


construction activity is generally higher. Historically, most Chenal Valley sales take place in the second half of the year.
 Geographic Areas
 All of our timberlands, wood products manufacturing facilities and other real estate assets are located within the continental United States In 2018, 2017 and 2016, less than 1% of our Wood Products' segment revenues were derived from sales of manufactured wood products outside of the United States, primarily to Canada and Mexico. The remainder of our revenues were from domestic sales.
Environmental Regulation
 Our operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, including those relating to our emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management, site remediation, endangered species and our forestry activities. We are also subject to the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes relating to the health and safety of our employees. We maintain environmental and safety compliance programs and conduct regular internal and independent third-party audits of our facilities and timberlands to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental regulations is a significant factor in our business and requires capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs.
 Due to the significance of regulation to our business, we integrate wildlife, habitat and watershed management into our resource management practices. We also take an active approach to regulatory developments by participating in standard-setting where possible. We work cooperatively with regulators to create voluntary conservation plans that address environmental concerns while preserving our ability to operate our timberlands efficiently.
 Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, particularly relating to air and water quality, or their enforcement, may require significant expenditures by us or may adversely affect our timberland management, harvesting activities and manufacturing operations.
 Similarly, a number of species indigenous to our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered or have been proposed for one or the other status under the Endangered Species Act. As a result, our activities in or adjacent to the habitat of these species may be subject to restrictions on the harvesting of timber, reforestation activities and the construction and use of roads.
 We expect legislative and regulatory developments in the area of climate change to address carbon dioxide emissions and renewable energy and fuel standards. It is unclear as of this date how any such developments will affect our business.
 We believe that our manufacturing facilities and timberland operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We cannot be certain, however, that situations that give rise to material environmental liabilities will not be discovered.
 At this time, we believe that federal and state laws and regulations related to the protection of endangered species and air and water quality will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We anticipate, however, increasingly strict laws and regulations relating to the environment, natural resources and forestry operations, as well as increased social concern over environmental issues, may result in additional restrictions on us, leading to increased costs, additional capital expenditures and reduced operating flexibility.

Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,471 employees; 53 of which are part time. The workforce consisted of 441 salaried and 1,030 hourly employees. As of December 31, 2018, 12% of the workforce was covered under a collective bargaining agreement, which expires in 2020.
