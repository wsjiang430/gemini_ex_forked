Unless the context requires otherwise or unless otherwise stated, references to “our Company,” “Pacific Ventures,” “PACV,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar references refer to Pacific Ventures Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
Pacific Ventures was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 3, 1986, under the name AOA Corporation. On November 12, 1991, the Company changed its name to American Eagle Group, Inc. On October 22, 2012, the Company changed its name to Pacific Ventures Group, Inc.
 
The current structure of Pacific Ventures resulted from a share exchange with Snöbar Holdings, Inc. (“Snöbar”), which was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposes. On August 14, 2015, Pacific Ventures and its stockholders entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Snöbar Holdings, Inc. (“Snöbar Holdings”), pursuant to which Pacific Ventures acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Snöbar Holdings’ Class A and Class B common stock in exchange for 22,500,000 restricted shares of Pacific Ventures’ common stock, while simultaneously issuing 2,500,000 shares of Pacific Ventures’ restricted common stock to certain other persons, including for services provided and to a former officer of the Company (the “Share Exchange”).As the result of the Share Exchange, Snöbar Holdings. became Pacific Venture’s wholly owned operating subsidiary and the business of Snöbar Holdings became the Company’s sole business operations, and Snöbar Holdings’ majority owned subsidiary, MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation (“MGD”),became indirect subsidiary of Pacific Ventures.
 
Prior to the Share Exchange, the Company operated as an insurance holding company and through its subsidiaries, marketed and underwrote specialized property and casualty coverage in the general aviation insurance marketplace. However, in 1997, after selling several of its divisions, the Company’s remaining insurance operations were placed into receivership and the Company ceased operating its insurance business.
 
Since the Share Exchange represented a change in control of the Company and a change in business operations, the business operations changed to that of Snöbar Holdings and the discussions of business operations accompanying this filing are solely that of Snöbar Holdings and its affiliates and subsidiaries comprising of Snöbar Trust , IPIC, and MGD.
 
Snöbar Holdings was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7, 2013. Snöbar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary of Snöbar Trust, a California trust (“Trust”), which was formed in June 1, 2013. The current trustee that holds legal title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge, who is the father of Shannon Masjedi, who is the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and majority stockholder . The Trust owns 100% of the shares of International Production Impex Corporation, a California corporation (“IPIC”), which was formed on August 2, 2001. IPIC is in the business of selling alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops, and holds all of the rights to the liquor licenses to sell such products and trade names “SnöBar”. As such, the Trust holds all ownership interest of IPIC and its liquor licenses, permitting IPIC to sell its product to distributors, with all income, expense, gains and losses rolling up to the Trust, of which Snöbar Holdings is the sole beneficiary. Snöbar Holdings also owns 99.9% of the shares of MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation (“MGD”). MGD is in the business of selling and leasing freezers and providing marketing services. As a result of the foregoing, Snöbar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of all assets, liabilities and any income received from the business of the Trust and IPIC through the Trust and is the parent company of MGD.
 
The Trust and IPIC are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and Snöbar Holdings is identified as the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification(“ASC”) 810, Snöbar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. As the assessment of Snöbar Holdings’ management is that Snöbar Holdings has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC), and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE’s economic performance, it was therefore concluded by management that Snöbar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such, the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the financial statements of Snöbar Holdings since the inception of the Trust, in the case of the Trust, and since the inception of Snöbar Holdings, in the case of IPIC.
 
On June 12, 2017, the Company, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire Healthy Foods Markets LLC, a Carson, California based healthy food and grocery retailer. The contemplated acquisition of the business was aimed at creating a fulfillment center for the Sn ö bar products and to create additional and immediate revenue and exposure for the Company. However, after further consideration and additional due diligence review of the target businesses, the Company determined to rescind the transaction and the related purchase agreements.
 
On May 1, 2018, Royalty Foods Partners, LLC – a Florida Limited Liability Corporation and a subsidiary of Pacific Ventures Group, Inc. – completed an asset acquisition of San Diego Farmers Outlet, Inc. (SDFO), a California Corporation. San Diego Farmers Outlet was started in over thirty-five years ago to provide primarily restaurants customers in southern California’s three largest counties with quality food and produce, and does business under the names of Farmers Outlet and San Diego Farmers Outlet.

Description of Operations of Pacific Ventures Group, Inc.
 
General
 
On May 1, 2018, Royalty Foods Partners, LLC – a Florida Limited Liability Corporation and a subsidiary of Pacific Ventures Group, Inc. – completed an asset acquisition of San Diego Farmers Outlet, Inc. (SDFO), a California Corporation. San Diego Farmers Outlet was started in over thirty-five years ago to provide primarily restaurants customers in southern California’s three largest counties with quality food and produce, and does business under the name of Farmers Outlet and San Diego Farmers Outlet.
 
Farmers Outlet provides a wide array of products to serve customers of all types. However, they do have a niche in providing fresh produce and food products. Farmers Outlet provides specialty produce that the larger distributors do not carry on a daily basis. Unlike some larger distributors who make their customers receive products on a day and time convenient to the distributor, Farmers Outlet delivers daily and pays attention to what the customer wants. Farmers Outlet added products to meet the needs of restaurants, Hotels, Clubs and bars, Resorts, food trucks and caterers. Free delivery was added to demonstrate that Farmers Outlet had customers interest first in mind.
 
Since the acquisition, SDFO has increased sales of its wholesale business, and still plan on expanding our current delivery territory from 25 miles to a 40-mile radius. SDFO is also in the process of obtaining new delivery trucks to add to the current fleet of trucks. The Company has begun marketing to new restaurants in the area, most notably Asian and Italian restaurants, and have let restaurants know that SDFO can deliver the finest produce in market.
 
SDFO installed new signage around the retail market, added additional landscaping to enhance the appearance of the market, and purchased a new Point of Sale system to improve efficiency and ordering processes.
 
The Company will continue to evaluate its projected expenditures relative to its available cash and to seek additional means of financing in order to satisfy the Company’s working capital and other cash requirements.
 
Market and Strategy
 
SDFO covers a large market area servicing Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego, which we have estimated to be a $2.5 billion addressable market.

Pacific Ventures intends to expand its business through the acquisition of other food manufacturing and distribution companies that serve the Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego area, thereby combining and expanding upon a combined customer base with a expanding range of products and services.
 
Pacific Ventures will continue to market its SnöBar product line, which include proprietary premium ice cream and sorbets that are distilled spirit cocktails containing up to 15% quality liqueurs and liquors. Currently, there are four flavors available: Brandy Alexander; Brandy Alexander with chocolate chips; Grasshopper; and Pink Squirrel. There are also numerous different liquor ice cream flavors in development in classic ice cream drink styles such as Coffee Liqueur Ice Cream, Piña Colada Sorbet, Sherry Ice Cream, and Strawberry Margarita Sorbet. Pacific Ventures is establishing a new production relationship with a wholesale frozen food co-packing company that can meet our volume production and HAACP quality control requirements.
 
Trademarks
 
IPIC sells the SnöBar products under a number of trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to its continued success. The SnöBar brand is fully trademarked within the United States. IPIC’s business could be adversely affected by the loss of any major brand or by material infringement of its intellectual property rights. The SnöBar products are also subject to intellectual property risks because existing trademark laws offer only limited protection, and the laws of some countries in which the SnöBar products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not fully protect the SnöBar products from infringement by others.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, Pacific Ventures comprised five (5) employees who managed the affairs of the parent corporation and the operations of its subsidiaries. On an as needed basis, the Company hires independent contractors to perform specific tasks related to the Company’s business interests.
