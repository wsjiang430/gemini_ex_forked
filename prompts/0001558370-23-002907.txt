Item 1.   Business
Overview 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on providing novel cell therapies to people with cancer. We are a leader in the development of T-cell therapies for solid tumors and have reported responses in multiple solid tumor indications. 
​
Our proprietary platform enables us to identify cancer targets, find and develop cell therapy candidates active against those targets and produce therapeutic candidates for administration to patients. Our cell therapy candidates include genetically engineered T-cell receptors (“TCRs”) and HLA-independent TCRs (“HiTs”) where surface proteins are targeted independently of the peptide-HLA complex. Our cell therapies are currently manufactured on an autologous or per patient basis and we have a proprietary preclinical allogeneic platform for the development of “off the shelf” cell therapies. 
​
Our MAGE-A4 cell therapy franchise includes T-cell therapy products targeting solid tumor indications in which the MAGE-A4 antigen is expressed, with responses seen in eight indications (head and neck, esophagogastric junction (“EGJ”), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-squamous, synovial sarcoma, melanoma, urothelial, ovarian and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS) indications). Filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for the lead product (afamitresgene autoleucel or “afami-cel”) in synovial sarcoma has been initiated with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), with completion of the filing targeted for mid-2023. 
​
Clinical programs with our MAGE-A4 targeted cell therapies are as follows: 
​

● | SPEARHEAD-1 Phase 2 Trial with afami-cel (ADP-A2M4): A registration directed Phase 2 clinical trial is ongoing in synovial sarcoma in which the MAGE-A4 antigen is expressed. Enrollment in Cohort 1 is complete, and the cohort met its primary endpoint with an overall response rate (ORR) of approximately 39% and a median duration of response of 50.3 weeks seen in synovial sarcoma patients. Cohort 2 of the trial is ongoing although enrollment is now complete.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | SURPASS-3 Phase 2 Trial with ADP-A2M4CD8. A Phase 2 trial for people with platinum resistant ovarian cancer is initiating in early 2023. We have received RMAT designation (Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation) for ADP-A2M4CD8 for the treatment of this indication from the FDA. In the Phase 1 SURPASS trial an ORR of 43% in ovarian cancer was reported in November 2022. The Phase 2 trial will evaluate ADP-A2M4CD8 in both monotherapy and in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, in ovarian cancer in conjunction with The GOG Foundation, Inc.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | SURPASS Phase 1 Trial with ADP-A2M4CD8: Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 1 trial for ADP-A2M4CD8, focusing on treatment of patients with head and neck and urothelial cancers in which the MAGE-A4 antigen is expressed. Across all indications and as of November 23, 2022, the trial has an overall response rate of 37%. In the focus areas of ovarian, urothelial and head and neck cancers the response rate is 75% in patients with 3 or fewer prior lines of therapy (9 out of 12 patients). The trial includes a combination cohort where participants receive a combination of ADP-A2M4CD8 together with a checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab). Two new cohorts in urothelial and head and neck cancers for patients with fewer lines of therapy and in combination with standard of care in those settings are also planned to initiate shortly.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Outside of the MAGE-A4 franchise, we have a preclinical program for T-cell therapies directed to the PRAME target which is expressed in a broad range of tumors. This program is being transitioned from GSK following termination of our collaboration agreement with GSK. Dependent on the data arising from the preclinical program, the first cell therapy targeting PRAME is anticipated to be IND-ready by the end of 2023.

We are also developing allogeneic or “off-the-shelf” cell therapies utilizing a proprietary allogeneic platform. The platform utilizes cells derived from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (“iPSCs”), which can be gene-edited to express our engineered TCRs or other constructs and then differentiated into the required end cell type, for example T-cells. The platform is applicable to all of our cell therapies. 
We have a strategic collaboration with Genentech Inc (“Genentech”). The collaboration with Genentech covers the research and development of “off-the-shelf” cell therapies for up to five shared cancer targets (“off-the-shelf” products) and the development of a novel allogeneic personalized cell therapy platform. 
We also have several development and research collaborations including a clinical and preclinical alliance agreement with MD Anderson Cancer Center. A prior collaboration with GSK terminated during 2022 and we are negotiating a transition agreement with GSK in relation to ongoing clinical trials with T-cell therapies directed to the NY-ESO and PRAME targets. A prior Co-development and Co-commercialization agreement (the “Astellas Collaboration Agreement”) with Universal Cells, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Universal Cells”) under which we collaborated with Universal Cells to research, develop, and commercialize certain cellular therapy products directed to certain targets was mutually agreed to terminate as of March 6, 2023. Termination does not impact the development of our allogeneic cell lines for our internal allogeneic programs or for our collaboration with Genentech Inc. The parties previously terminated an Amended and Restated Research Collaboration and License Agreement, dated January 13, 2020, effective February 26, 2023.
​
We are an integrated cell therapy company with our own manufacturing facility in the U.S. for autologous products and in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) for allogeneic products together with a dedicated lentiviral vector manufacturing suite in the UK within the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult facility at Stevenage. This enables us to continue improving the patient experience associated with our cell therapies including the ability to rapidly introduce improvements to the manufacturing process and patient supply chain. 
In November 2022 we took a decision to focus our clinical and preclinical programs on the MAGE-A4 and PRAME targets including the BLA submission for afami-cel. We have stopped the SURPASS-2 trial in GE cancers and the TIL-IL7 program. We have also paused any further investment in non-core activities including certain preclinical programs including the HiT program, additional target programs (other than the PRAME program) and alternative HLA programs. We also announced that investment in commercialization of afami-cel will be delayed given the BLA filing timelines. Given the de-prioritisation of non-core programs resulting from this decision, we are undertaking associated cost reduction activities including a reduction in headcount of approximately 25% which we currently estimate will extend our cash runway into early 2025. The headcount reduction has now concluded.
On March 6, 2023 we announced entry into a definitive agreement under which we will combine with TCR² Therapeutics Inc (“TCR2”) in an all-stock transaction to create a preeminent cell therapy company focused on treating solid tumors. The combination provides extensive advantages for clinical development and product delivery supported by complementary technology platforms. The lead clinical franchises for the combined company will utilize engineered T-cell therapies targeting MAGE-A4 and mesothelin. These targets are expressed on a broad range of solid tumors and are supported by early- and late-stage clinical data. The combined company also has a preclinical pipeline of additional target opportunities with development initially focused on PRAME and CD70. The merger agreement was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Following the closing of the transaction, Adaptimmune shareholders will own approximately 75% of the combined company and TCR2 stockholders will own approximately 25% of the combined company. The agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants given by us and TCR2. The agreement also contains customary pre-closing covenants, including covenants by each of the parties relating to conduct of their respective business prior to the closing of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in Q2 2023, subject to the receipt of approvals by Adaptimmune shareholders and TCR2 stockholders and satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions. Following the closing of the transaction we currently estimate that the cash runway of the combined company will extend into early 2026.

Business Strategy 
Building on our leadership position with engineered T-cell therapies in solid tumor indications, our strategic objective is to be a world leader in designing, developing and delivering cell therapies that transform the lives of people with cancer. Our objective is to revolutionize the treatment of solid tumors with a single dose of engineered TCR T-cells and as a result to address cancers with high unmet needs with both autologous and allogeneic solutions. To achieve our objectives, our primary core value drivers are as follows:
Filing the BLA for afami-cel and progressing towards commercialization of afami-cel. We initiated the rolling filing of the BLA with the FDA in Q4 2022 for use of afami-cel for the treatment of synovial sarcoma. Completion of the rolling filing of all modules of the BLA is targeted for mid-2023. Commercial preparations are underway for the launch of afami-cel in synovial sarcoma where there are limited options and a poor prognosis for individuals with advanced disease.
Progressing the ADP-A2M4CD8 T-cell therapy into later phase clinical trials. Subject to the data from the ongoing SURPASS family of clinical trials, we plan to rapidly progress clinical candidates through clinical trials and towards BLA filing. For example, our Phase 2 ovarian cancer trial with ADP-A2M4CD8 is initiating in 2023 and the SURPASS Phase 1 trial continues in multiple indications including with cohorts aimed at using ADP-A2M4CD8 in earlier lines of treatment alongside existing standard of care. 
​
Progressing the ADP-A2M4CD8 T-cell therapy into earlier lines of therapy. We are initiating two new cohorts in the SURPASS trial in urothelial and head and neck cancers for patients with fewer lines of therapy and in combination with standard of care in those settings.
Progressing PRAME directed T-cell therapies into the clinic. We aim to complete preclinical development of our first T-cell therapy directed to PRAME during 2023 and file an IND rapidly following completion of preclinical studies.
Continuing to develop “off-the-shelf” cell immunotherapies and progress allogeneic cell therapies to the clinic. We continue to develop our “off-the-shelf” (allogeneic) platform, which is broadly applicable to cell therapies, both internally and in collaboration with our partners Astellas and Genentech. 
Continuing to improve our manufacturing and patient supply processes to optimize how we deliver our cell therapies to patients. Our integrated cell therapy capabilities enable us to continually enhance our cell and vector manufacturing and supply processes which we believe will ultimately enable us to treat patients quicker, at a lower cost and more effectively. We have manufacturing facilities in the U.K. and U.S. and our U.S. manufacturing facility has been expanded in anticipation, pending FDA approval, of commercialization of afami-cel for the treatment of synovial sarcoma.
Our Cell Therapies for Cancer 
The Immune System and T-cells
The immune system plays an important role in targeting and destroying cancer cells. Specifically, T-cells, which are a type of white blood cell, and their receptors create a natural system that is designed to scan the body for diseased cells. In general, cells process proteins internally and then convert these proteins into peptide fragments which are then presented on the cell surface by a protein complex called the Human Leukocyte Antigen (“HLA”). T-cells naturally scan all other cells in the body for the presence of abnormal peptide fragments, such as those generated from infectious agents. Recognition of this peptide-HLA complex takes place through the T-cell receptor or TCR expressed on the T-cells. However, binding of naturally occurring TCRs to cancer targets tends to be very poor because cancer proteins appear very similar to naturally occurring proteins on healthy cells.

Cancer Target Identification and Validation
Before developing any engineered T-cell therapy, it is important to identify and validate a suitable target cancer peptide or protein. The target must be expressed only on the cancer cells of interest and with expression in normal non-cancerous tissue only where a risk to the patient would be deemed acceptable. Careful validation and identification of targets is important to ensure that any engineered cell therapy is specific to the targeted cancer and does not bind to the same target on non-cancer cells, or that the receptor in the cell therapy does not recognize a similar peptide or protein derived in normal cells. 
​
Cell Therapies
We have developed a range of cell therapies all of which utilize the interaction between a T-cell via its TCRs and a peptide or protein. Our cell therapies can be made directly from a patient’s own T-cells (“autologous” cell therapies) or manufactured from stem cells (“allogeneic” cell therapies).

For all of our autologous cell therapies patient T-cells are extracted and are then engineered to generate the end cell therapy whether this is through engineering of the TCR itself or through the addition of another agent which enhances the efficacy of the TCR or T-cell. The nature of the engineering impacts the type of cell therapy product generated. The engineered T-cells are then expanded and infused back into the patient. When these T-cells encounter a recognized peptide or protein within the patient’s body, they multiply and initiate the destruction of the targeted cancer cells. 
For our allogeneic T-cell therapies, Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells ("iPSCs”) are gene edited to express the engineered TCR or HiT and potentially a range of next gen modifications. As part of the gene editing the iPSCs are also edited to remove certain HLA-type expression so that patients expressing any HLA-type can be treated with the same end product. Those gene-edited iPSCs are then differentiated, using a number of directed process steps, into T-cells, which can then be used to treat patients expressing the tumor antigen to which the TCR or HiT is directed.
​
Our TCR T-cells (SPEAR T-cells) 
Following identification of a suitable target peptide, we identify TCRs that are capable of binding to that target peptide or protein. We then engineer and optimize those identified receptors to enhance their ability to recognize and bind to the cancer targets, thereby enabling a highly targeted immunotherapy which complements a patient’s immune system. The optimized TCR or SPEAR-T-cell for the cell therapy then undergoes extensive preclinical safety testing prior to administration to patients. A lentiviral vector is used to transfer the engineered TCR into the patient’s T-cells if that patient has the relevant target and HLA type for our TCR cell therapy. The optimized cell therapy then undergoes extensive preclinical safety testing prior to administration to patients. 
Our HiT Cell Therapies
Naturally occurring TCRs recognize peptides that are presented on the cell surface by a protein complex called HLA. Patient treatment with our SPEAR T-cells requires patients to express a particular HLA-type. We have now developed a TCR platform capable of producing TCRs able to recognize targets expressed on the surface of cancer cells independently of HLA-type. The TCR is engineered to recognize and bind to a cell surface protein. The HiT platform enables us to identify suitable targets and to then generate engineered HiTs which can bind and interact with those targets. These HLA-independent TCRs or HiTs use the same internal cell signaling processes as naturally occurring TCRs.

​
​
A registration directed Phase 2 clinical trial is underway in synovial sarcoma in which the MAGE-A4 antigen is expressed. Enrollment in Cohort 1 is complete, and the cohort met its primary endpoint. Cohort 2 of the trial is ongoing although enrollment has now met its target and ongoing enrollment is paused. A BLA is in the process of being filed with the FDA, with the first modules filed in December 2022. Completion of the rolling filing of all modules of the BLA is targeted for mid-2023.
​
Clinical data was presented at the Connective Tissue Oncology Society (“CTOS”) in November 2022. An Overall Response Rate (ORR) per independent review of approximately 39% in synovial sarcoma was presented together with a median duration of response of just over 50 weeks. Afami-cel continues to have an acceptable benefit to risk profile. The charts below summarize the best overall responses by RECIST v1.1 as of August 29, 2022 for cohort 1 of the Spearhead-1 trial.

Phase 1 Trial with ADP-A2M4CD8
​
Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 1 trial (“SURPASS” trial) for a next generation SPEAR T-cell, ADP-A2M4CD8. This next generation SPEAR T-cell utilizes the same engineered T-cell receptor as afami-cel, but with the addition of a CD8α homodimer. The addition of the CD8α homodimer has been shown in

We are focusing recruitment in the SURPASS trial on head and neck cancer and urothelial cancer. Taken together with ovarian cancer, a response rate of 75% was seen as of November 23, 2022 in patients with three or fewer lines of therapy (9 out of 12 patients in trial). As a result of these data, we are initiating new cohorts within the SURPASS trial for treatment of earlier line patients in urothelial and head and neck cancers alongside standard of care treatment. We also continue to enroll in a cohort looking at the combination of ADP-A2M4CD8 with a checkpoint inhibitor.

The trial will evaluate the T-cell therapy in both monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab (a checkpoint inhibitor) in platinum resistant ovarian cancer. We recently received FDA RMAT designation for ADP-A2M4CD8 for the treatment of patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer.
​
Other Clinical Programs
​
Two further clinical programs, the ADP-A2AFP Phase 1 trial and the SURPASS-2 Phase 2 trial, have closed to enrollment. We are also in discussions with GSK in relation to the transition of clinical trial programs for cell therapies targeting the NY-ESO antigen across multiple tumors.
​
Preclinical Candidate Pipeline
Our aim is to utilize the insights we obtain from our clinical trials and translational sciences work to improve the efficacy of our existing products and approaches; and to increase the scope of our cell therapies and ability to treat an increasing number of patients. We are currently focusing our preclinical pipeline on the development of T-cell therapies to target PRAME expressing tumors and on our allogeneic cell therapies.
Allogeneic iPSC Platform
We continue to develop our allogeneic platform which can be used to generate ‘off-the-shelf’ cell therapies that are universally applicable to all eligible patients by developing gene-edited iPSCs which are differentiated to T-cells by our in-house proprietary process. These “off-the-shelf” cells are being developed to overcome the current limitation of autologous therapies that need to be manufactured specifically for each patient. Additionally, our process starts with iPSCs instead of donor-derived T-cells, which potentially reduces product variability. 
The enhanced T-cell technology being developed involves selective engineering for the removal of potentially immunogenic cell surface proteins (for example, HLA molecules) and the addition of our TCRs, without the use of 

8



nucleases, to develop these T-cell products. If successful, this will enable us to treat our patients with an “off-the-shelf” or on demand cell therapy product without the need to acquire a patient’s own cells. 
We have two collaboration programs, one with Astellas in which an allogeneic product incorporating a HiT targeting mesothelin is being developed (and a further target has been nominated); and one with Genentech, in which “off-the-shelf” cell therapies for up to five shared cancer targets (“off the shelf” products) and a novel allogeneic personalized cell therapy platform are being developed.
Integrated Cell Therapy Company
We are committed to building an integrated cell therapy company with a broad range of capabilities that enable the research and development of cell therapies, the translational analyses of clinical responses, control of the manufacturing and supply chain and commercialization. The ability to take learnings from every stage of the process and feed these learnings back into further research and development enables decisions to be taken at the appropriate time and improvements and enhancements to processes and products to be made effectively and in a timely manner.
We have our own autologous cell therapy manufacturing facility at the Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which is capable of supplying all of our autologous cell therapies currently in the clinic. The Navy Yard facility will also support the anticipated commercial launch in the US of afami-cel. A new manufacturing facility dedicated to allogeneic drug product manufacture opened in 2022 and is co-located with our research facility in Milton Park in the U.K. We also have our own dedicated vector manufacturing capability in the U.K., within the Catapult Cell and Gene Therapy Manufacturing Centre in Stevenage, which is now able to produce lentiviral vector for our clinical trials using a proprietary suspension process. 
Control of our own end-to-end manufacturing processes (including vector, T-cell and analytical quality control testing) enables us to improve and further develop these processes for manufacture of our cell therapies. The ability to manufacture in-house provides security of supply at a lower cost than using a third-party provider. In addition, the ability to continually evaluate and optimize processes enables ongoing reduction in the times taken to treat our patients and the overall cost of goods applicable to manufacture and supply of our cell therapies.
Core Alliances and Collaborations
Genentech Strategic Collaboration and License Agreement 
On September 3, 2021, Adaptimmune Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adaptimmune Therapeutics Plc, entered into a Strategic Collaboration and License Agreement with Genentech, Inc. and F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (the “Agreement”).

​
In addition, Adaptimmune will receive tiered royalties on net sales in the mid-single to low-double digits. 
​
Adaptimmune also has a right to opt-in to receive a profit share and to co-promote “off-the-shelf” T-cell therapies. If Adaptimmune elects to opt in, then Adaptimmune will be eligible to share 50 percent of profits and losses from U.S. sales on such products and to receive up to $800 million in ex-U.S. regulatory and sales-based milestone payments, as well as royalties on ex-U.S. net sales.
​
The parties can terminate the Agreement in the event of material breach or insolvency of the other party. Genentech is entitled to terminate the Agreement in its entirety, on a product-by-product basis or collaboration target by collaboration target basis on provision of 180 days notice. 
​
Universal Cells Co-development Collaboration Agreement 
On January 13, 2020, the Company entered into a Co-development and Co-commercialization agreement (the “Astellas Collaboration Agreement”) with Universal Cells, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Universal Cells”).
​
Under the Astellas Collaboration Agreement the parties agreed on up to three targets with the aim of co-developing T-cell therapies directed to those targets pursuant to an agreed research plan. The Company and Universal Cells mutually agreed to terminate the agreement as of March 6, 2023. In connection with the termination, all licenses and sublicenses granted to either party pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement ceased, and each party is required to return all confidential information of the other party within 30 days of the Effective Date. Each party also agreed to destroy all cell lines and other materials of the other party in its possession within 30 days of the Effective Date. There were no termination penalties in connection with the termination.
In addition to the Astellas Collaboration Agreement, the parties previously entered into an agreement relating to the use of Universal Cells gene editing and HLA-editing technology in the context of our development of allogeneic T-cell therapies. This Agreement was terminated by notice on January 27, 2023, effective 30 days following receipt of notice of termination. Termination follows our decision to change the cell line being used to develop its MAGE-A4 allogeneic cell therapy due to the presence of a chromosomal abnormality in the original cell line provided by Universal Cells under the Agreement. As a result of termination, all licenses between the parties to the Agreement will cease and each party is required to return all confidential information of the other party. 
​
Development and Research Collaborations
GSK Collaboration and License Agreement 
We entered into the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement regarding the development, manufacture and commercialization of TCR therapeutic candidates in May 2014. The collaboration was terminated in October 2022 and we are in discussions with GSK in relation to the transition of the NY-ESO and PRAME programs under the collaboration agreement to Adaptimmune. A further amendment to the collaboration agreement was entered into on December 19, 2022 for the deletion of certain provisions relating to GSK’s post termination manufacturing and supply obligations and payment of £5 million by GSK to Adaptimmune.

Preclinical and Clinical Collaborations 
We have third-party collaborations in place with Noile-Immune and Alpine Immune Sciences.
With Alpine, we are collaborating to develop next-generation SPEAR T-cell products that incorporate Alpine’s secreted and transmembrane immunomodulatory protein technology. The collaboration agreement was announced in May 2019, and we believe that the Alpine technology could complement our existing internal next generation technology and enhance anti-tumor potential through engagement of further rapid and flexible immunomodulatory mechanisms. 
In the Noile-Immune collaboration, announced in August 2019, we will co-develop next-generation SPEAR T-cell products, incorporating Noile-Immune’s PRIME (proliferation inducing and migration enhancing) technology, based upon co-expression of IL-7 and CCL19. 
We also have a strategic alliance agreement with the MD Anderson Cancer Center which covers both the conduct of certain clinical trials for our SPEAR T-cell therapies and also certain pre-clinical research work.
Intellectual Property 
We seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, enforcing and defending patent rights for our SPEAR T-cells and processes, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other protection including data/market exclusivity for our cell therapies, manufacturing and platform technology, preserve the confidentiality of our know-how and trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position generally by filing an initial priority filing at the U.K. Intellectual Property Office (“UKIPO”) and/or the U.S. Patent Trademark Office (“USPTO”). This is followed by the filing of a patent application under the Patent Co-operation Treaty (“PCT”) claiming priority from the initial application(s) and then application for patent grant in, for example, the U.S., Europe (including major European territories), Japan, Australia, New Zealand, India and Canada. In each case, we determine the strategy and territories required after discussion with our patent professionals to ensure that we obtain relevant coverage in territories that are commercially important to us and reflect the scope of cell therapies being developed. We will additionally rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available, including as relevant exclusivity through orphan or pediatric drug designation. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our underlying platform technologies, manufacturing processes and pre-clinical candidates. 
Product Patent Families 
Afami-cel  - We own three patent families covering the composition of matter of ADP-A2M4 and other related TCRs and T-cell therapies. The patent application claims are primarily directed to the engineered TCR therapeutic candidate and in particular the amino acid substitutions required for such engineered TCR therapeutic candidate. National/regional applications have been filed via the PCT in all commercially relevant territories and claims have been allowed in Europe and the US. We project the patents within these families, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, will expire in 2037 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions). PCT applications have also been filed in relation to the use of ADP-A2M4 TCR in the treatment of head and neck, lung and ovarian cancers.
ADP-A2M4CD8 – We own a patent family covering the composition of matter of ADP-A2M4CD8 and other related TCR T-cell therapies. The patent application claims are directed to the engineered TCR therapeutic candidate in combination with the CD8 next generation technology. We project the patents within this family, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2039 (worldwide, excluding 

11



possible patent term extensions). PCT applications have also been filed in relation to the use of A2M4CD8 TCR in the treatment of esophageal and gastric cancers, head and neck, urothelial and ovarian cancers.
PRAME TCR T-cell – We have filed a priority patent application covering the composition of matter of the TCR T-cell therapy family directed to the PRAME target. The patent application claims are primarily directed to the engineered TCR candidate and in particular to the amino acid substitutions required for such TCR candidate. National and regional applications will be filed via the PCT in due course.
Platform Technology
We own a number of platform technology patents and patent applications which are directed to certain aspects of the process that we use to engineer our SPEAR TCRs and other cell therapies. Some of these are owned jointly with Immunocore Limited, with whom we have historically had a shared development history.
Manufacturing Process Patents and Patent Applications
We have trade secrets and patent applications relating to the manufacture of our cell therapies. For example, we have filed patent applications in commercially relevant territories, which claim priority from initial priority patent applications filed at the USPTO and UKIPO, which are directed to a particular modification to the lentiviral vector technology. We believe this modification enhances the safety profile of the lentiviral vector technology. This has been granted in the U.S. Further patent applications have been filed on the manufacturing and quality control of our products.
Preclinical and Next Generation Approaches
We have filed seven patent families covering a range of next generation technology approaches and/or combination approaches. 
Allogeneic iPSC Platform Approaches
We have filed a number of patent applications covering our proprietary iPSC stem cell differentiation technology which enables the differentiation of stem cells into T-cells which can then be administered to patients. The patent applications are primarily directed to the various stages required for the differentiation of the iPSC stem cells into different cell line types including NK cells, NKT cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and T-cells. The earliest of these applications have now been filed as PCT applications and will be pursued in all commercially relevant territories. Patent protection is projected to extend to 2040 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions).
 Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights
We have a non-exclusive license from ThermoFisher Inc. under certain of its intellectual property rights covering its Dynabeads® CD3/CD28 technology. This technology is used in our manufacturing process to isolate, activate and expand patient T-cells. We also have a supply agreement which runs until December 31, 2025. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Reliance Upon Third Parties—We rely heavily on ThermoFisher and the technology we license from them.”
Whether licenses are required under any third-party patents depends on what steps we take going forward in relation to our manufacturing processes, development processes and development products including our allogeneic manufacturing and differentiation process. We may need to negotiate a license under any third-party patents or develop alternative strategies for dealing with any third party patents if licenses are not available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.

Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies and intense competition. Competitors include large pharmaceutical companies with established development and 

12



commercialization programs, biotechnology companies with varying development and commercialization capabilities and academic centers developing novel technologies and products. 
​
We face competition in all of the following areas:
​

(a) | From other autologous cell therapies: There are a number of other cell therapies which have already received marketing approval or which are currently in clinical trials. For example, AbecmaTM, BreyanziTM, CARVYTKITM, TecartusTM, KymriaTM, and YescartaTM which have received marketing Iovance’s Lifileucel TIL cell therapy and TCR2 Therapeutics’ TRuC T-cells.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

(b) | From other TCR T-cell therapies: Third parties and academic institutions are developing TCR-based cell therapies which are directed to single or multiple targets including HPV-16 E6/E7, KRAS, MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, MAGE A3/A6, MAGE-A4, MART1, NRAS, NY-ESO-1, p53, PRAME, mesothelin, as well as personalized neoantigen targets. These cell therapies are at a variety of preclinical and clinical development stage. Examples include Immatics’ IMA203 and IMA203CD8 assets that recognize a PRAME pHLA complex, which is currently being investigated across various solid tumor indications in clinical Phase I trial evaluations. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

(c) | From other cell-based immunotherapy approaches: The immune system utilizes a number of different cell types and processes. Other immunotherapy approaches may target different parts of the immune system including different types of T-cells (for example, gamma delta T-cells), macrophage based systems, NK-cell based products, Marrow-infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs) and virus-specific T-cells.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

(d) | From other allogeneic cell therapy approaches: Multiple third parties are currently developing allogeneic cell therapy approaches. These can be derived from healthy donors (for example Allo-501A from Allogene Therapeutics), umbilical cord blood, or induced pluripotent stem cells (for example, FT819 being developed by Fate Therapeutics). In Dec 2022, Atara Bio’s donor-derived EbvalloTM was granted approval from the European Commission for both adults and children with Epstein-Barr positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

(e) | From other therapeutic product types. In any indication that we address there may be multiple other product modalities which are already being marketed and where we will have to show increased benefit to patients, or which are in clinical trials. For example, small molecule chemotherapy agents, biologics (e.g. peptides, antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates), vaccines, oncolytic viruses, other cell therapies (for example, gamma delta T-cells, macrophage-based systems, NK-cell-based products, Marrow-infiltrating lymphocytes, and virus-specific T-cells). Where products receive approval and start being used within the patient setting, such products can also impact our ability to complete clinical development and obtain information around the safety and efficacy of our own products.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Where we see competition in any indication and a competitor receives marketing approval before our cell therapy, we will need to demonstrate increased efficacy over the competing product. 
​
Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU and U.K, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the various federal, state and local level laws and requirements can also result in severe penalties and restrictions to the business.

13



FDA Approval Process 
In the U.S., therapeutic products, including drugs, biologics, and medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products. Biological products are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, and are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) via a BLA. The application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are generally similar to those for new drug applications (“NDAs”), and biologics are associated with generally similar, if not greater, approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Biological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves: 

● | preclinical studies, including laboratory and animal tests,
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical testing may commence, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product biochemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for toxicity and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use for supporting subsequent clinical testing. In the United States, certain preclinical trials must comply with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice requirements ("GLPs") and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Act, as well as other federal regulations and requirements. 
IND Submission
In order to begin clinical testing of an investigational biologic product, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical Studies
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject 

14



selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an Investigational Review Board (“IRB”) for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An Investigational Review Board (“IRB”) may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
In December 2022, Congress passed the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (“FDORA”), which includes provisions related to diversity in clinical trial enrollment. Once the new provisions go into effect, sponsors conducting a phase three study or another pivotal study must submit a diversity action plan to the FDA by the time they submit their study protocol. The FDA may waive the requirement to submit a diversity action plan if a waiver is necessary due to the prevalence or incidence of the disease or condition that is the subject of the trial or the patient population that may use the drug or device, or if implementing a diversity action plan would be impracticable, or against the public health interest during a public health emergency. The FDA may apply a waiver on its own initiative or at the request of a sponsor. If a sponsor requests a waiver, the FDA must grant or deny a waiver within 60 days of receiving such a request.
BLA Review Process
After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing, compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls, as well as proposed labeling for the product. 

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDFUA”), the FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Under Standard Review, applications for new biologic products are reviewed within 10 months of the date the FDA filed the BLA (approximately 60 days after receipt); under Priority Review, BLAs are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA filed the BLA. Priority Review can be applied to a biologic that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for Standard and Priority BLAs, and the review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 

15



Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes physicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. 
After the FDA evaluates the BLA, it issues either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may identify substantial additional testing, or information, that must be developed in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation And Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. 
Expedited Development Programs
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of certain biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment, which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition, and/or would provide an improvement over existing therapies. These expedited programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review:

● | Pursuant to Section 506(b) of the FDCA, Fast Track designation is available for drug and biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and for which preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Fast Track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For biologics, the sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for Fast Track status any time before receiving a BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA meeting. Fast Track designation provides for additional interactions with FDA to expedite development and review of the BLA, and may also allow for rolling submission and review of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuant to Section 506(a) of the FDCA, Breakthrough Therapy designation is available if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drug products, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the same benefits as Fast Track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Requests for Breakthrough Therapy designation should ideally be made prior to the End-of-Phase 2 Meeting. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accelerated Approval is available for drug or biological products that treat a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provide a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, the product must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM), which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16




may require that a sponsor of a biologic receiving Accelerated Approval perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical trials in the post-marketing phase. If the FDA concludes that a biologic shown to be potent can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. In December 2022, the passage of FDORA made several changes to the FDA’s Accelerated Approval program. Among other things, FDORA provides the FDA greater authority to ensure that sponsors begin confirmatory trials promptly, including prior to BLA approval. FDORA also provides the FDA with additional authority to withdraw approval of a product for which confirmatory studies are not completed or are inadequate to demonstrate a satisfactory benefit:risk profile. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Under PDUFA, a BLA that receives Priority Review will have a 6-month goal date for first cycle review, rather than the 10-month goal date under Standard Review. To qualify for Priority Review, the FDA must determine that the biologic product has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The decision to grant Priority Review is made by the FDA within 60 days of receipt of the BLA. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ​
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review, and Accelerated Approval generally do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation
As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress created the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, a product candidate that meets the following criteria: 

● | it qualifies as an RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
A sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for Priority Review or Accelerated Approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted Accelerated Approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may, as appropriate, fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical trials, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval. Like some of FDA’s other expedited development programs, RMAT designation does not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process. 
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug or biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition. A rare disease or condition is one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the U.S. for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the biological product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 

17



Orphan drug designation confers several benefits, including certain tax credits for clinical research, a waiver of the BLA application fee, and exemption from certain pediatric study requirements, among others. The key benefit of orphan drug designation is orphan drug exclusivity, which is a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product for that indication. Generally, the first BLA applicant with FDA orphan drug designation for a particular biological substance to treat a particular disease that obtains FDA approval is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. During the orphan drug exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same biological product for the same rare disease or condition, with limited exceptions. One exception is if the later application can demonstrate clinical superiority to the biological product with orphan drug exclusivity. Clinical superiority may be shown by greater efficacy, greater safety, or a major contribution to patient care.
Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition. 
Pediatric Data and Study Requirements
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs or BLAs (as well as efficacy supplements) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or biological product is approved as safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of these assessments. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans (“PSPs”) within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting, or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”), a sponsor may qualify for “pediatric exclusivity” if it conducts pediatric studies in response to a Written Request issued by FDA. Pediatric exclusivity extends by 6 months the period of other regulatory exclusivities, such as orphan drug exclusivity, so long as those exclusivity periods will not expire within 9 months of the award of pediatric exclusivity. For drug products, pediatric exclusivity will also extend the preclusive effect of patents on the FDA’s authority to approve certain competitor applications. Pediatric exclusivity does not extend patents for biological products approved under BLAs. To qualify for pediatric exclusivity, a sponsor must conduct studies that fairly respond to a Written Request, which outlines in detail the nature and type of studies that must be conducted. The studies need not show the product to be effective in the pediatric population; so long as the clinical studies are determined to fairly respond to the Written Request, pediatric exclusivity will be awarded. The FDA may issue a Written Request on its own initiative or at the sponsor’s request. A Written Request can include multiple studies in both approved and “off-label” indications.
Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the U.S. and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of 

18



the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Biosimilars
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”) created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be “highly similar” to or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product must contain evidence to show that the biosimilar product is “highly similar” to an approved reference biological product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Data to show biosimilarity can include: (1) analytical studies; (2) animal studies; and (3) a clinical study or studies. The FDA has the discretion not to require each of these categories of data. A biosimilar can be approved by the FDA for some or all of the same conditions of use, strengths, dosage forms, and routes of administration as the FDA-approved reference product. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. At this time, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the product. 
The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) 18 months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Post-Approval Requirements
Approved drug and biological products are subject to ongoing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee 

19



for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

​
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A sponsor may only make claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. The FDA has generally required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain marketing approval through the pre-market approval (“PMA”) process for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a cancer therapeutic involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”).
The PMA process involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. 

20



Successful PMA approval is uncertain, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA finds the PMA application is approvable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, and other statutes pertaining to health care fraud and abuse. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the Healthcare Reform Act amended the federal false claims law such that a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal false claims law. 
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror/payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements
Various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, the environment and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research are applicable to our activities. They include, among others, the U.S. Atomic Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, national restrictions on technology transfer, import, export, and customs regulations, and other present and possible future local, state, or federal regulation. 
​
European Union, UK and Rest of the World Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions both due to the location of our facilities and the fact that we are engaging in clinical programs outside of the U.S. and will need to obtain worldwide regulatory approval for our TCR therapeutic candidates. In particular we have clinical trials ongoing in the United Kingdom and in certain countries in the European Union (“EU”) and are subject to regulations relating to performance of those clinical trials and manufacture and supply of our cell therapies in those countries. Prior to supplying any cell therapy in any country or starting any clinical trials in any country outside of the U.S. we must obtain 

21



the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in such countries. The existence of a U.S. regulatory approval does not guarantee that regulatory approvals will be obtained in other countries in which we wish to conduct clinical trials or market our cell therapies. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively prior to any clinical trial being conducted in the relevant country. A marketing authorization application is then submitted to the EMA for approval by the European Commission. Finally, prior to any commercial supply, a pricing and reimbursement application is submitted to each relevant country’s national or local health authority(ies).
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. However, the interpretation of these requirements may well differ from country to country.
Review and Approval of Drug Products Outside of the U.S.
In order to market any product outside of the U.S., a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Procedures Governing Approval of Products in the EU and U.K.
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. A clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. Similar approval requirements apply in the UK and a clinical trial application must be made to the UK regulatory authority (MHRA) prior to starting any clinical trial.
To obtain marketing approval of a product under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the scientific assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. For advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), the scientific evaluation of MAA is primarily performed by the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT). The CAT prepares a draft opinion of each ATMP subject to a MAA which is sent for final approval to the CHMP. 

22



Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. Then, the European Commission grants or refuses the marketing authorization, following a procedure that involves representatives of the member states. Although the CHMP's opinion is not binding, the Commission's decision to grant or refuse the market authorization is frequently in accordance with the CHMP's assessment except in very rare cases. For marketing approval in the U.K, an application for marketing approval will be made for the MHRA and follows a similar process to that used in the EU.
Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state or in the U.K. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
As a result of Brexit, as of January 1, 2021, marketing authorizations granted on the basis of a centralized procedure in the EU are only valid in Northern Ireland, but not in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). However, prior EU authorizations have all been automatically converted into U.K. marketing authorizations effective in Great Britain. UK rules require marketing authorization holders to be established in the U.K. or in the EU/European Economic Area. EU rules require marketing authorization holders to be established in the EU/European Economic Area and, in addition, that certain activities be performed in the EU, related for example to pharmacovigilance, batch release and quality control. Marketing authorization holders may need to take steps to comply with these requirements aiming at holding both a EU and a U.K. marketing authorization.
With regard to the sunset clause, from the perspective of the U.K, the period of three years during which the drug has not been marketed in Great Britain will be restarted from the date of conversion to a Great Britain marketing authorization. From the perspective of the EU, in case the drug has been marketed in the U.K, the placing on the U.K. market before the end of the Brexit transition period will be taken into account. If, after the end of the Brexit transition period, the drug is not placed on any other market of the remaining member states of the EU, the three year period for the sunset clause will start running from the last date the drug was placed on the U.K. market before the end of the Brexit transition period. 
Legal Proceedings and Related Matters
From time to time, we may be party to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. We do not have any pending litigation that, separately or in the aggregate, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Employees and Human Capital Management 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 534 employees. Of these employees, 407 were in research and development (including in manufacturing and operations, and quality control and quality assurance) and 127 were in management and administrative functions (including business development, finance, intellectual property, information technology and general administration). We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or require representation by a labor union. In November 2022, we announced that, in addition to de-prioritizing non-core programs, we were also undertaking a headcount reduction of approximately 25% to 30%. The reduction was completed in Q1 2023 with an overall reduction of approximately 25%. 

23



We value our employees and as a company work hard to employ those individuals that will work with us to achieve the objectives of the Company and share our values. We engage with our employees in multiple ways including through companywide business meetings, social events and smaller team events. We employ individuals based on their experience and ability to perform the applicable job and encourage diversity in our workforce whenever possible. We have an equal opportunities policy which promotes the right of every employee to be treated with dignity and respect and not to be harassed or bullied on any grounds. We employ individuals from approximately 32 different nationalities within our U.K. and U.S. offices and are working to encourage diversity within our workforce. We have a Diversity and Inclusion Council with membership comprising diverse employees from all levels in the Company and a Diversity and Inclusion Plan has been created and championed across the business by the executive team and presented to the Board. D&I progress updates are reviewed regularly by the Board Remuneration Committee.
We have a performance-based reward scheme, bonus scheme and share option plan which all employees are entitled to participate in. These schemes and other employee incentive programs are designed to retain employees. Over 2022, the total global attrition rate was approximately 22%.
