Overview
California Water Service Group is a holding company incorporated in Delaware in 1999 with six operating subsidiaries: California Water Service Company (Cal Water), New Mexico Water Service Company (New Mexico Water), Washington Water Service Company (Washington Water), Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. (Hawaii Water), and CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility Services LLC (CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility Services LLC being referred to collectively in this annual report as Utility Services). Cal Water, New Mexico Water, Washington Water, and Hawaii Water are regulated public utilities. The regulated utility entities also provide some non-regulated services. Utility Services holds non-utility property and provides non-regulated services to private companies and municipalities outside of California. Cal Water was the original operating company and began operations in 1926.
Our business is conducted through our operating subsidiaries and we provide utility services to approximately two million people. The bulk of the business consists of the production, purchase, storage, treatment, testing, distribution and sale of water for domestic, industrial, public and irrigation uses, and for fire protection. In some areas we provide wastewater collections and treatment services, including treatment which allows water recycling. We also provide non-regulated water-related services under agreements with municipalities and other private companies. The non-regulated services include full water system operation, billing and meter reading services. Non-regulated operations also include the lease of communication antenna sites, lab services and promotion of other non-regulated services.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no significant changes in the kind of products produced or services rendered by our operating subsidiaries, or in the markets or methods of distribution.

Regulated Business
California water operations are conducted by Cal Water, which provides service to approximately 486,900 customer connections in approximately 100 California communities through 20 separate districts, which are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). Cal Water operates two leased water systems, the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, which are governed through their respective city councils and are outside of the CPUC's jurisdiction. California water operations accounted for approximately 94.1% of our total customer connections and of our total consolidated operating revenue.
Hawaii Water provides service to approximately 4,800 water and wastewater customer connections on the islands of Maui and Hawaii, including several large resorts and condominium complexes. Hawaii Water's regulated customer connections are subject to the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (HPUC). Hawaii Water accounts for 0.9% of our total customer connections and approximately 3.5% of our total consolidated operating revenue.
Washington Water provides domestic water service to approximately 17,600 customer connections in the Tacoma and Olympia areas. Washington Water's utility operations are regulated by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission. Washington Water accounts for approximately 3.4% of our total customer connections and approximately 1.7% of our total consolidated operating revenue.
5

New Mexico Water provides service to approximately 8,200 water and wastewater customer connections in the Belen, Los Lunas, Indian Hills, and Elephant Butte areas in New Mexico. New Mexico's regulated operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission. New Mexico Water accounts for approximately 1.6% of our total customer connections and 0.7% of our total consolidated operating revenue.
The state regulatory bodies governing our regulated operations are referred to as the Commissions in this annual report. Rates and operations for regulated customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the respective state's regulatory Commission. The Commissions require that water and wastewater rates for each regulated district be independently determined based on the cost of service, except in Washington, which has a statewide tariff. The Commissions are expected to authorize rates sufficient to recover normal operating expenses and allow the utility to earn a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.
We distribute and treat water and treat wastewater in accordance with accepted water utility methods. Where applicable, we hold franchises and permits in the cities and communities where we operate. The franchises and permits allow us to operate and maintain facilities in public streets and right-of-ways as necessary.
We operate the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce water systems under lease agreements. In accordance with the lease agreements, we receive all revenues from operating the systems and are responsible for paying the operating costs. The City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce lease revenues are governed through their respective city councils and are considered non-regulated because they are outside of the CPUC's jurisdiction. We report revenue and expenses for the City of Hawthorne and City of Commerce leases in operating revenue and operating expenses because we are entitled to retain all customer billings and are responsible for all operating expenses. These leases are considered "nontariffed products and services" (NTPS) by the CPUC and require a 10% revenue sharing with regulated customers.
In October of 2011, an agreement was negotiated with the City of Hawthorne to lease and operate its water system. The system, which is located near the Hermosa Redondo district, serves about half of Hawthorne's population. The capital lease agreement required an up-front $8.1 million lease deposit to the city that is being amortized over the lease term. Additionally, annual lease payments will be adjusted based on changes in rates charged to customers. Under the lease, we are responsible for all aspects of system operation and capital improvements, although title to the system and system improvements reside with the city. Capital improvements are recorded as depreciable plant and equipment and depreciated per the asset lives set forth in the agreement. In exchange, we receive all revenue from the water system, which was $10.1 million, $10.0 million and $8.5 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. At the end of the lease, the city is required to reimburse us for the unamortized value of capital improvements made during the term of the lease. The City of Hawthorne capital lease is a 15-year lease and expires in 2026.
In April of 2018, a renewal agreement was negotiated with the City of Commerce for us to continue to lease and to operate its water system for the next 15 years. Under the agreement, the operating lease requires us to pay $0.8 million per year in monthly installments. We have operated the City of Commerce water system since 1985 and are responsible for all operations, maintenance, water quality assurance, customer service programs, and financing capital improvements to provide a reliable supply of water that meets federal and state standards to customers served by the City of Commerce system. The City of Commerce will retain title to the system and system improvements and remain responsible for setting its customers’ water rates. We bear the risks of operation and collection of amounts billed to customers. In exchange, we receive all revenue from the water system, which was $3.0 million, $3.4 million, and $2.5 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The agreement allows us to request a rate change annually in order to recover costs. 
Non-Regulated Activities
Fees for non-regulated activities are based on contracts negotiated between the parties. Under our non-regulated contract arrangements, we operate municipally owned water systems, privately owned water and recycled water distribution systems, but are not responsible for all operating costs. Non-regulated revenue received from water system operations is generally determined on a fee-per-customer basis. 
Non-regulated revenue and expenses consist primarily of the operation of water systems that are owned by other entities under lease agreements, leasing of communication antenna sites on our properties, billing of optional third-party insurance programs to our residential customers, and unrealized gains or losses on benefit plan investments.
Effective June 30, 2011, the CPUC adopted new rules related to the provision of non-regulated services using utility assets and employees. As a result, nearly all California non-regulated activities are now considered NTPS. The prescribed accounting for these NTPS is incremental cost allocation plus revenue sharing with regulated customers. Non-regulated services determined to be "active activities" require a 10% revenue sharing, and "passive activities" require a 30% revenue sharing. The amount of non-regulated revenues subject to revenue sharing is the total billed revenues less any authorized pass-through costs. Some examples of CPUC authorized pass-through costs are purchased water, purchased power, and pump taxes. All of our non-regulated services, 
6

except for leasing communication antenna sites on our properties, are "active activities" subject to a 10% revenue sharing. Leasing communication antenna sites on our properties are "passive activities" subject to a 30% revenue sharing. Cal Water's annual revenue sharing with regulated customers was $2.6 million, $2.2 million, and $2.1 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
Operating Segment
We operate in one reportable segment, the supply and distribution of water and providing water-related utility services. For information about revenue from external customers, net income and total assets, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Growth
We intend to continue exploring opportunities to expand our regulated and non-regulated water and wastewater activities in the western United States. The opportunities could include system acquisitions, lease arrangements similar to the City of Hawthorne and City of Commerce contracts, full service system operation and maintenance agreements, meter reading, billing contracts and other utility-related services.
Geographical Service Areas and Number of Customer Connections at Year-end
Our principal markets are users of water within our service areas. The approximate number of customer connections served in each regulated district, the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, at December 31 is as follows:

Rates and Regulation
The Commissions have plenary powers setting both rates and operating standards. As such, the Commissions' decisions significantly impact the Company's revenues, earnings, and cash flows. The amounts discussed herein are generally annual amounts, unless otherwise stated, and the financial impact to recorded revenue is expected to occur over a 12-month period from the effective date of the decision. In California, water utilities are required to make several different types of filings. Certain filings, such as General Rate Case (GRC) filings, escalation rate increase filings, and offset filings, may result in rate changes that generally remain in place until the next GRC. As explained below, surcharges and surcredits to recover balancing and memorandum accounts as well as GRC interim rate relief are temporary rate changes which have specific time frames for recovery.
The CPUC follows a rate case plan which requires Cal Water to file a GRC for each of its regulated operating districts every three years. In a GRC proceeding the CPUC not only considers the utility's rate setting requests, but may also consider other issues that affect the utility's rates and operations. The CPUC is generally required to issue its GRC decision prior to the first day of the test year or authorize interim rates. In accordance with the rate case plan, Cal Water filed its most recent GRC application in July of 2018 requesting rate changes effective January 1, 2020.
Between GRC filings, Cal Water may file escalation rate increases, which allow Cal Water to recover cost increases, primarily from inflation and incremental investments, during the second and third years of the rate case cycle. However, escalation rate increases are district specific and subject to an earnings test. The CPUC may reduce a district’s escalation rate increase if, in the most recent 13-month period, the earnings test reflects earnings in excess of what was authorized for that district.
In addition, California water utilities are entitled to make offset requests via advice letter. Offsets may be requested to adjust revenues for construction projects authorized in GRCs when those capital projects go into service (these filings are referred to as "rate base offsets"), or for rate changes charged to Cal Water for purchased water, purchased power, and pump taxes (which are referred to as "expense offsets"). Rate changes approved in offset requests remain in effect until the next GRC is approved.
In pursuit of the CPUC's water conservation goals, the CPUC decoupled Cal Water's revenue requirement from customer consumption levels in 2008 by authorizing a Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (WRAM) and Modified Cost Balancing Account (MCBA) for each district. The WRAM and MCBA ensure that Cal Water recovers revenues authorized by the CPUC regardless of customer consumption. This removes the historical disincentive against promoting lower water usage among customers. Through an annual advice letter filing, Cal Water recovers any under-collected metered revenue amounts authorized, or refunds over-collected quantity revenues, via surcharges and surcredits. The advice letters are filed between February and April of each year and address the net WRAM and MCBA balances recorded for the previous calendar year. The majority of WRAM and MCBA balances are collected or refunded through surcharges/surcredits over 12 and 18 months. The WRAM and MCBA amounts are cumulative, so if they are not amortized in a given calendar year, the balance is carried forward and included with the following year balance. Cal Water has a Sales Reconciliation Mechanism (SRM) in place for the second and 
8

third years of a GRC that allow the company to adjust its adopted sales forecast if actual sales vary from adopted sales by more than 5.0% in the prior year. The SRM moderates the growth of the net WRAM and MCBA balance.
Regulatory Activity - California
2015 GRC Filing
On December 15, 2016, the CPUC voted to approve Cal Water's 2015 GRC settlement agreement. The approved decision, which was proposed by the presiding Administrative Law Judge in November 2016, authorized Cal Water to increase gross revenue by approximately $45.0 million starting on January 1, 2017, up to $17.2 million in 2018, up to $16.3 million in 2019, and up to $30.0 million upon completion and approval of the Company’s advice letter projects. The 2018 and 2019 revenue increases were subject to the CPUC’s earning test protocol.
The CPUC’s decision also authorized Cal Water to invest $658.8 million in water system improvements throughout California over the three-year period of 2016-2018 in order to continue to provide safe and reliable water to its customers. This figure included $197.3 million of water system infrastructure improvements that is be subject to the CPUC’s advice letter procedure.
2018 GRC Filing
On July 2, 2018, Cal Water filed a GRC requesting new water infrastructure investments of $828.5 million in accordance with the rate case plan for all of its regulated operating districts for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. The CPUC will evaluate the new water infrastructure improvement investments along with operating budgets to establish water rates that reflect the actual cost of service. The required filing begins an approximately 18-month review process, with any changes in customer rates expected to become effective in 2020. Cal Water has proposed to the CPUC to increase revenues by $50.7 million, or 7.6%, in 2020; $31.5 million, or 4.4%, in 2021; and $33.0 million, or 4.4%, in 2022 as compared to the last authorized revenue. More than half of Cal Water’s proposed $828.5 million of new infrastructure improvements relate to its transmission and distribution pipeline replacement program, and all are necessary to enhance reliability, augment water supply, and upgrade aging water system infrastructure. The plans also reflect Cal Water's cost-control measures to reduce operating and administrative costs. The GRC involves litigation and potential settlement among Cal Water, the California Public Advocates Office, and other interested parties.
Cost of Capital Application
In April of 2017, Cal Water, along with three other water utilities, filed an application to adopt a new cost of capital and capital structure for 2018. On March 22. 2018, the CPUC adopted a revised decision in the cost of capital proceeding for Cal Water and three other water utilities for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, establishing for Cal Water a 9.20% return on equity and a 5.51% cost of debt, with a capital structure of 46.60% long-term debt and 53.40% common equity, and an authorized return on rate base of 7.48%, compared with Cal Water’s prior return on equity of 9.43%, cost of debt of 6.24%, and authorized return on rate base of 7.94%. The adopted capital structure did not change. The adopted returns on debt and equity reduced Cal Water’s 2018 adopted revenue by approximately $6.9 million. The CPUC also authorized continuation of the water cost of capital adjustment mechanism, which provides for an adjustment in the return on equity if the cost of long-term debt as defined by an index of utility debt rates varies from the most recent index by 100 basis points or more in 2019 and 2020.
On March 30, 2018, Cal Water submitted an advice letter that established the Cost of Capital Memorandum Account (CoC MA) to track the difference between current rates and rates based upon the new cost of capital adopted by the CPUC as if the new cost of capital had been in effect beginning January 1, 2018. 
In May of 2018, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to adopt the new cost of capital and capital structure for 2018 in customer rates. The annual adopted gross revenue reduction associated with the May 2018 filing was $6.9 million. The new rates became effective on July 1, 2018. 
For the first six months of 2018, Cal Water recorded a $2.8 million reduction to revenue with a corresponding regulatory liability due to the CoC MA.
2018 Tax Accounting Memorandum Account (TAMA)
On December 22, 2017, the CPUC sent a letter to All Class A and B Water and Sewer Utilities on the subject of “Changes in Federal Tax Rates for 2018.” The CPUC required Cal Water to establish a memorandum account to track the impact of the TCJA on Cal Water. The TAMA will track the revenue requirement impact of the TCJA not otherwise reflected in rates from January 1, 2018 until current rates are modified to reflect all impacts of the TCJA. The Hawaii Water, Washington Water, and New Mexico Water Commissions have similar requirements to track the impact of the changes to the federal tax law. For 2018, 
9

the Company recorded a $5.0 million reduction to revenue with a corresponding regulatory liability due to the changes required by the TCJA.
In May of 2018, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to adopt the new federal corporate income tax rate in customer rates. The annual adopted gross revenue reduction associated with the May 2018 filing was $11.1 million. The new rates became effective on July 1, 2018.
Escalation Increase Requests
As a part of the decision on the 2015 GRC, Cal Water was authorized to request annual escalation rate increases for 2018 and 2019 for those districts that passed the earnings test. In November of 2017, Cal Water requested escalation rate increases for 2018 in all of its regulated districts. The annual adopted gross revenue associated with the November 2017 filing was $15.9 million. The new rates became effective on January 1, 2018.
In November of 2018, Cal Water requested escalation rate increases for 2019 in all of its regulated districts. The annual adopted gross revenue associated with the November 2018 filing was $16.2 million. The new rates became effective on January 1, 2019.
Expense Offset Requests
Expense offsets are dollar-for-dollar increases in revenue to match increased expenses, and therefore do not affect net operating income. In October of 2017, Cal Water submitted advice letters to request offsets for increases in purchased water costs and pump taxes in five of its regulated districts totaling $2.2 million. The new rates became effective on January 1, 2018.
In May and June of 2018, Cal Water submitted advice letters to request offsets for increases in purchased water costs and pump taxes in five of its regulated districts totaling $3.8 million. The new rates became effective on July 1, 2018.
In November of 2018, Cal Water submitted advice letters to request offsets for increases in purchased water costs and pump taxes in five of its regulated districts totaling $2.0 million. The new rates became effective on January 1, 2019.
Rate Base Offset Requests
For construction projects authorized in GRCs as advice letter projects, Cal Water is allowed to request rate base offsets to increase revenues after the project goes into service. In November of 2017, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to recover $1.4 million of annual revenue increase for a rate base offset in one of its regulated districts. The new rates became effective on January 1, 2018.
During the first six months of 2018, Cal Water submitted advice letters to recover $2.1 million of annual revenue increases for rate base offsets in all of its regulated districts. The new rates became effective on July 1, 2018.
In November of 2018, Cal Water submitted advice letters to recover $0.2 million of annual revenue increases for rate base offsets in four of its regulated districts. The new rates are expected to become effective on April 15, 2019.
WRAM/MCBA Filings
In April of 2018, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to true up the revenue under-collections in the 2017 annual WRAMs/MCBAs of its regulated districts. A net under-collection of $50.1 million is being recovered from customers in the form of 12, 18, and greater-than-18-month surcharges. The new rates became effective April 15, 2018. This surcharge is in addition to surcharges/surcredits authorized in prior years which have not yet expired.
Drought Memorandum Account
In March of 2018, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to request recovery of 2016 and 2017 incremental drought expenses of $3.3 million. On January 10, 2019, the Commission approved Cal Water's request for recovery of the $3.3 million of incremental expenses; subsequently, Cal Water submitted an advice letter on January 15, 2019 to implement a surcharge to recover the incremental expenses from customers. The new rates are expected to become effective on April 15, 2019.
1,2,3 Trichloropropane (TCP) Memorandum Account
Established in December 2009, the TCP memorandum account tracks the costs incurred and proceeds received and applied with respect to litigation against manufacturers and distributors referred to as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) that manufactured and distributed products that contained TCP in California. Cal Water incurred incremental internal and external costs to support its litigation effort. The TCP memorandum account also tracks litigation awards and settlement proceeds. Finally, the TCP memorandum account will track the application of funds received towards remediation costs, including TCP water treatment expenses and the costs of investments in replacement and treatment property.
10

On December 20, 2017, Cal Water entered into an $85.0 million settlement agreement and release of claims with the PRPs, in California Water Service Company and City of Bakersfield v. The Dow Chemical Company, et al., Civil Case No. CIV-470999 (TCP Action). The TCP Action seeks damages and other relief related to the PRPs’ alleged contamination of drinking water supply and water wells with the chemical TCP.
The proceeds from the settlement, after payment of the legal fees, was $56.0 million and will be used to reimburse a portion of the capital costs associated with Cal Water’s remediation efforts related to such alleged TCP contamination. As of December 31, 2018, Cal Water has used $43.9 million of the proceeds on remediation efforts related to the alleged TCP contamination. Under the terms of the Agreement, the PRPs are released from all claims regarding 47 of the 57 total claimed wells, and Cal Water agrees to file a dismissal with prejudice of the TCP Action. The PRPs are also released from future claims regarding TCP contamination of any other wells, unless and until Cal Water has installed granular activated carbon filtration systems or other then-approved State treatment technology for TCP on, or replaced, 36 wells due to TCP contamination.
Travis Air Force Base
On September 29, 2016, Cal Water entered into a 50-year agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to acquire the water distribution assets of and distribute water to most of Travis Air Force Base (TAFB) beginning in 2018. On May 31, 2017, Cal Water submitted an application to the CPUC seeking approval to distribute water service to most of the base and to establish rates for its service.
On December 13, 2018, the CPUC conditionally approved Cal Water’s request to own and operate the TAFB water system as a regulated water utility district. Approval was conditioned upon modifying the contract between Cal Water and the Department of Defense to more clearly assert the CPUC’s jurisdiction over a new Travis District. In January of 2019, Cal Water fulfilled the condition by submitting a contract amendment that was approved by the CPUC. The decision enables Cal Water to acquire the water distribution assets of TAFB from the U.S. Department of Defense and provide water utility service to the base for a term of 50 years. Subject to the terms of the contract with the Department of Defense and the CPUC decision, Cal Water will begin serving TAFB’s more than 15,000 active and reserve personnel and civilians in 2019. The CPUC will regulate water rates, rules, and tariffs for the system as part of Cal Water’s normal three-year rate case cycle.
Lead Service Line Memorandum Account (LSL MA)
On September 27, 2016, the Governor signed Senate Bill No. 1398 (SB 1398) which added Section 116885 to the Health and Safety Code. The new section stipulates that water systems compile an inventory of known lead service lines used in their distribution systems and identify areas that may have lead service lines used in its distribution system by July 1, 2018. After completing the inventory, the bill also requires water systems provide a timeline for replacement of those known lead service lines to the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). For those that may have lead service lines, the bill requires water systems to either determine the existence or absence thereof by July 1, 2020, and provide that information to the SWRCB or provide a replacement timeline for those service lines whose lead content cannot be determined. Approval of the timeline rests with the SWRCB. Cal Water met the July 1, 2018 reporting deadline where it described 52% of its service lines were identified as not containing lead and the remaining 48% unknown. In order to meet the July 1, 2020 deadline, Cal Water needs to determine if the remaining 48% of service lines contain lead. If the absence of lead cannot be determined, plans must be made to replace the line pursuant to the requirements in SB 1398. A significant amount of field research is needed to meet the 2020 reporting deadline. To that end, in December of 2018, Cal Water submitted an advice letter that established the LSL MA, which gives Cal Water the opportunity to recover costs associated with this effort. Granted by the CPUC in January of 2019, the LSL MA will track all incremental expenses associated with studying and potentially replacing lead service lines for the benefit of Cal Water’s customers.

2017 Waikoloa (Hawaii Water) GRC Filings
In December of 2017, Hawaii Water filed GRC applications requesting an additional $3.8 million in annual revenues for its Waikoloa Village and Resort Systems with the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission. The GRCs seek recovery of capital investments in the Waikoloa Village and Waikoloa Resort Systems as well as increases in operating expenses since the previous rate case. On January 1, 2019, the HPUC authorized Waikoloa Village rate increases of $0.8 million for 2019 and $0.1 million for 2020. On January 7, 2019, the HPUC authorized Waikoloa Resort rate increases of $0.8 million for 2019, $0.8 million for 2020, and $0.1 million for 2021.
2018 Washington Water GRC Filing
On July 2, 2018, Washington Water submitted a GRC application to the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC) to increase revenues to cover the higher costs of providing a reliable, high-quality water supply. The 
11

application requested an increase of $1.6 million in annual revenue, which is an increase of 13.8% over 2017 revenue. Washington Water requested recovery for numerous water system upgrades and additions that Washington Water had made since its last GRC, which include new pumping equipment, water treatment facilities, wells, water mains, and new storage. Increases in operating costs are also a factor in the proposed increase. The application reflected increases in materials, equipment, depreciation expense due to the addition of new facilities, and increases in employee wages and health care costs. The UTC authorized an annual rate increase of $1.1 million on November 1, 2018 and the new rates became effective on December 1, 2018.
Water Supply
Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of their supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. To the best of management's knowledge, we are meeting water quality, environmental, and other regulatory standards for all Company-owned systems.
Historically, approximately half of our annual water supply is pumped from wells. State groundwater management agencies operate differently in each state. Some of our wells extract ground water from water basins under state ordinances. These are adjudicated groundwater basins, in which a court has settled the dispute between landowners or other parties over how much annual groundwater can be extracted by each party. All of our adjudicated groundwater basins are located in the State of California. Our annual groundwater extraction from adjudicated groundwater basins approximates 6.8 billion gallons or 14.0% of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Historically, we have extracted less than 100% of our annual adjudicated groundwater rights and have the right to carry forward up to 20% of the unused amount to the next annual period. All of our remaining wells extract ground water from managed or unmanaged water basins. There are no set limits for the ground water extracted from these water basins. Our annual groundwater extraction from managed groundwater basins approximates 29.1 billion gallons or 59.4% of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Our annual groundwater extraction from unmanaged groundwater basins approximates 13.1 billion gallons or 26.6% of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Most of the managed groundwater basins we extract water from have groundwater recharge facilities. We are required to pay well pump taxes to financially support these groundwater recharge facilities. Our well pump taxes for 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $14.7 million, $13.9 million, and $11.3 million, respectively. In 2014, the State of California enacted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014. The law and its implementing regulations require most basins to select a sustainability agency by 2017, develop a sustainability plan by 2022, and show progress toward sustainability by 2027. We expect that in the future, groundwater will be produced mainly from managed and adjudicated basins.
California's normal weather pattern yields little precipitation between mid-spring and mid-fall. The Washington Water service areas receive precipitation in all seasons, with the heaviest amounts during the winter. New Mexico Water's rainfall is heaviest in the summer monsoon season. Hawaii Water receives precipitation throughout the year, with the largest amounts in the winter months. Water usage in all service areas is highest during the warm and dry summers and declines in the cool winter months. Rain and snow during the winter months in California replenish underground water aquifers and fill reservoirs, providing the water supply for subsequent delivery to customers. As of February 5, 2019, the State of California snowpack water content during the 2018-2019 water year is 111% of long-term averages (per the California Department of Water Resources, Northern Sierra Precipitation Accumulation report). The northern Sierra region is the most important for the state’s urban water supplies. The central and southern portions of the Sierras also have recorded 128% and 133%, respectively, of long-term averages. Management believes that supply pumped from underground aquifers and purchased from wholesale suppliers will be adequate to meet customer demand during 2019 and beyond. Long-term water supply plans are developed for each of our districts to help assure an adequate water supply under various operating and supply conditions. Some districts have unique challenges in meeting water quality standards, but management believes that supplies will meet current standards using current treatment processes.
On May 31, 2018, California's Governor Brown signed two bills (Assembly Bill 1668 and Senate Bill 606) into law that will establish long-term standards for water use efficiency. The bills revise and expand the existing urban water management plan requirements to include five year drought risk assessments, water shortage contingency plans, and annual water supply/demand assessments. By June 30, 2022, the California State Water Resources Control Board, in conjunction with the California Department of Water Resources, will establish long-term water use standards for indoor residential use, outdoor residential use, water losses and other uses. Cal Water will also be required to calculate and report on urban water use target by November 1, 2023 and each November 1 thereafter that compares actual urban water use to the target. Management believes that Cal Water is well-positioned to comply with all regulations required of utilities.

The Bear Gulch district obtains a portion of its water supply from surface runoff from the local watershed. The Oroville district in the Sacramento Valley, the Bakersfield district in the San Joaquin Valley, and the Kern River Valley district in the Los Angeles Area purchase water from a surface supply. Surface sources are processed through our water treatment plants before being delivered to the distribution system. The Bakersfield district also purchases treated water as a component of its water supply.
The Chico, Marysville, Dixon, and Willows districts in the Sacramento Valley, the Monterey Region district in the Salinas Valley, and the Selma and Visalia districts in the San Joaquin Valley obtain their entire supply from wells.
Purchases for the Los Altos, Livermore, Oroville, Redwood Valley, Stockton, and Bakersfield districts are pursuant to long-term contracts expiring on various dates after 2018. The water supplies purchased for the Dominguez, East Los Angeles, Hermosa Redondo, Palos Verdes, and Westlake districts as well as the Hawthorne and Commerce systems are provided by public agencies pursuant to a statutory obligation of continued non-preferential service to purveyors within the agencies' boundaries. Purchases for the Bayshore and Bear Gulch districts are in accordance with long-term contracts with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) until June 30, 2034.

We work with all local suppliers and agencies responsible for water supply to insure adequate, long-term supply for each system.
See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Water Supply" for more information on adequacy of supplies.
Seasonal Fluctuations
In California, our customers' consumption pattern of water varies with the weather, in terms of rainfall and temperature. In the WRAM and MCBA design, the CPUC considers the historical pattern in determining the adopted sales and production costs. With a majority of our sales being subject to the WRAM and production costs being covered by the MCBA, fluctuations in financial results have been minimized. However, cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings on our credit facilities can be significantly impacted by seasonal fluctuations including recovery of the WRAM and MCBA.
Our water business is seasonal in nature. Weather conditions can have a material effect on customer usage. Customer demand for water generally is lower during the cooler and rainy winter months. Demand increases in the spring when warmer weather returns and the rains end, and customers use more water for outdoor purposes such as landscape irrigation. Warm temperatures during the generally dry summer months result in increased demand. Water usage declines during the fall as temperatures decrease 
14

and the rainy season begins. During years in which precipitation is especially heavy or extends beyond the spring into the early summer, customer demand can decrease from historic normal levels, generally due to reduced outdoor water usage. Likewise, an early start to the rainy season during the fall can cause a decline in customer usage. As a result, seasonality of water usage has a significant impact on our cash flows from operations and borrowing on our short-term facilities.
Utility Plant Construction
We have continually extended, enlarged, and replaced our facilities as required to meet increasing demands and to maintain the water systems. We obtain construction financing using funds from operations, short-term bank borrowings, long-term financing, advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction that are funded by developers. Advances for construction are cash deposits from developers for construction of water facilities or water facilities deeded from developers. These advances are generally refundable without interest over a period of 40 years in equal annual payment amounts. Contributions in aid of construction consist of nonrefundable cash deposits or facilities transferred from developers, primarily for fire protection and relocation projects. We cannot control the amounts received from developers. This amount fluctuates from year-to-year as the level of construction activity carried on by developers varies. This activity is impacted by the demand for housing, commercial development, and general business conditions, including interest rates.
See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information.
Energy Reliability
We continue to use power efficiently to minimize the power expenses passed on to our customers, and maintain backup power systems to continue water service to our customers if the power companies' supplies are interrupted. Many of our well sites are equipped with emergency electric generators designed to produce electricity to keep the wells operating during power outages. Storage tanks also provide customers with water during blackout periods.
Impact of Climate Change Legislation and Regulation
Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California customers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings.
We maintain a fleet of vehicles to provide service to our customers, including a number of heavy duty diesel vehicles that were retrofitted to meet California emission standards. If future legislation further impacts the cost to operate the fleet or the fleet acquisition cost in order to meet certain emission standards, it will increase our cost of service and our rate base. Any increase in fleet operating costs associated with meeting emission standards will be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.
Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), all capital projects of a certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines and treatment facilities) require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit will be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base, which will be requested to be paid for by our customers. Any increase in the operating cost of the facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.
Cap and trade regulations were implemented in 2012 with the goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. These regulations have not impacted water utilities at this time. In the future, if we are required to comply with these regulations, any increase in operating costs associated with meeting these standards will be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.
Security at Company Facilities
Due to terrorism and other risks, we have heightened security at our facilities and have taken added precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to customers. In 2002, federal legislation was enacted that resulted in new regulations concerning security of water facilities, including submitting vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government. We have complied with regulations issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to federal legislation concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the EPA as required. In addition, communication plans have been developed 
15

as a component of our procedures. While we do not make public comments on our security programs, we have been in contact with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve our water delivery systems' security.
Quality of Water Supply
Our operating practices are designed to produce potable water in accordance with accepted water utility practices. Water entering the distribution systems from surface sources is treated in compliance with federal and state Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) standards. Most well supplies are chlorinated or chloraminated for disinfection. Water samples from each water system are analyzed on a regular, scheduled basis in compliance with regulatory requirements. We operate a state-certified water quality laboratory at the San Jose Customer Support Services Office that provides testing for most of our California operations. Certain tests in California are contracted with independent certified labs qualified under the Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program. Local independent state certified labs provide water sample testing for the Washington, New Mexico and Hawaii operations.
In recent years, federal and state water quality regulations have resulted in increased water sampling requirements. The SDWA continues to be used to monitor and regulate additional potential contaminants to address public health concerns. The State of California has continued to adopt new water quality regulations which may be in addition to those adopted by the EPA. We monitor water quality standard changes and upgrade our treatment capabilities to maintain compliance with the various regulations.
Competition and Condemnation
Our principal operations are regulated by the Commission of each state. Under state laws, no privately owned public utility may compete within any service territory that we already serve without first obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the applicable Commission. Issuance of such a certificate would only be made upon finding that our service is deficient. To management's knowledge, no application to provide service to an area served by us has been made.
State law provides that whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to the utility for its loss. State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies are empowered to condemn properties already operated by privately owned public utilities. The agencies are also authorized to issue bonds, including revenue bonds, for the purpose of acquiring or constructing water systems. However, if a public agency were to acquire utility property by eminent domain action, the utility would be entitled to just compensation for its loss. In Washington, annexation was approved in February 2008 for property served by us on Orcas Island; however, we continue to serve the customers in the annexed area and do not expect the annexation to impact our operations. To management's knowledge, other than the Orcas Island property, no municipality, water district, or other public agency is contemplating or has any action pending to acquire or condemn any of our systems.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by various governmental authorities. Environmental health and safety programs have been designed to provide compliance with water discharge regulations, underground and aboveground fuel storage tank regulations, hazardous materials management plans, hazardous waste regulations, air quality permitting requirements, wastewater discharge limitations and employee safety issues related to hazardous materials. Also, we actively investigate alternative technologies for meeting environmental regulations and continue the traditional practices of meeting environmental regulations.
For a description of the material effects that compliance with environmental regulations may have on us, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Regulatory Environment." We expect environmental regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future, and there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had 1,184 employees, including 51 at Washington Water, 46 at Hawaii Water, and 16 at New Mexico Water. In California, most non-supervisory employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO.
At December 31, 2018, we had 751 union employees. In January 2015, the Company negotiated a six-year contract. Wage increases for both unions in 2015, 2016, and 2017 was 3.25%, 2.75%, and 2.75%, respectively. For 2018, 2019, and 2020, union wage changes were tied to the changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Los Angeles, Riverside, and Orange County.  In the 
16

event an annual wage increase is determined to be greater than 3.25% or less that 2.0%, either party may request to re-open negotiations for wages only. Such notice must be served on the other party no later than 60 days after the publication of such CPI data. In 2018, the applicable CPI was 3.1%. Union wages were increased 3.1% for all union employees. The applicable CPI published in October of 2018 was 3.9%. The union requested to re-open wage negotiations due to increases in the 2018 CPI index above 3.25%. The Company and both unions negotiated an agreement for the 2019 and 2020 wage increases whereby the base pay for all employees was increased by 3.4% (the CPI for the Western US) effective January 1, 2019. In addition, the agreement established three regions for pay purposes (Region 1, Region 2, and Region 3). Employees in Region 2 will receive the 3.4% increase in base pay, plus a regional differential of 0.5% added to their pay (based on the CPI for the Los Angeles area) Employees in Region 3 will receive the 3.4% increase in base pay, plus a 0.9% regional differential (based on the CPI for the San Francisco area). For 2020, we will follow this same methodology to determine the base pay increase for all union positions (i.e. Region 1), plus the applicable regional differential for Region 2 and Region 3. The current agreement with the unions is effective through 2020. Management believes that it maintains good relationships with the unions. 
 In 2018, Hawaii Water employees voted to unionize in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company and union representatives are in the process of negotiating a contract. 
Employees at Washington Water and New Mexico Water are not represented by unions.
