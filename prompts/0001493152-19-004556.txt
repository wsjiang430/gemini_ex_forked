ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
The Company was incorporated on November 3, 2008 under the laws of the State of Nevada, to engage in certain business services. Our goal is to become a leading tournament gaming provider as well as an online destination, targeting over 250 million esports players and participants worldwide that want to compete at the high school or college level. We are a developmental stage business, have generated limited revenues to date and have a history of operating losses.
 
The Good Gaming platform was established in early 2014 by its founding members who recognized the need that millions of gamers worldwide desired to play games at competitive levels. The founders recognized that there was no structure or organization on a large scale for amateur gamers while professional esports was quickly establishing itself.
 
Good Gaming is effectively building the business infrastructure for the rapidly growing esports industry, similar to the high school and college athletic industry. Good Gaming is designed to be the gateway for amateur esports athletes to compete at the semi-professional level, improve their gaming skills, and interact with veteran gamers globally in a destination site and social networking framework.
 
Good Gaming differs from the professional level of the esports industry by focusing on more than 250 million gamers that fall below the professional level but are above the casual level, classified as “amateurs.” Good Gaming distinguishes itself from its direct and indirect competitors by being the first company to offer multi-game, multi-console services at the amateur esports level. The Company is not exclusive to any particular hardware or software vendor.
 
On May 4, 2016, the Company announced that it had completed its first closed public beta testing of their 2.0 tournament platform to determine the functionality, speed, ease of use, and accuracy of the system and are preparing to enter into full-blown production.
 
On February 18, 2016, the Company, formerly HDS International Corp., acquired the assets of Good Gaming, Inc. from CMG Holdings Group, Inc. (OTCQB: CMGO). On that date, the Company’s former CEO, Paul Rauner, resigned. The Company appointed Vikram Grover to the positions of CEO and Director of the board of directors (the “Board”). Vikram Grover is a former Wall Street analyst and investment banker with more than 20 years of experience in telecommunications, media and technology. In addition, David Dorwart was elected by the majority shareholders to the Company’s Board. Mr. Dorwart is the Co-Founder and Chairman of Assist Wireless, Inc., a provider of lifeline wireless services to tens of thousands of subscribers primarily in the Midwest.
 
On June 27, 2017 the Board of Directors of the Company appointed David B. Dorwart as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. On June 21, 2017, Mr. Dorwart was appointed to serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors. David B. Dorwart, Chairman and CEO of Good Gaming, Inc., brings over 31 years of start-up entrepreneurism and executive level management to the Company. Mr. Dorwart was a CoFounder and CEO of dPi Teleconnect, a prepaid wireless provider, for 10 years. During his tenure, he grew that company from a start-up to $75 million in revenues before selling it. Over the last 9 years, he has been involved with several other successful projects including Assist Wireless, Brooklet Energy Distribution, PayGo Distributors and Britton & Associates. He is currently the Chairman and CoFounder of ViaOne Services, a company which specializes in wireless communications and provides intricate multi-faceted services for start-up companies utilizing industry experts. By virtue of the ownership of this Series C Preferred Stock, ViaOne is the Company’s principal stockholder.
 
On June 27, 2017, the Company also bolstered its Board of Directors with executive level professionals by adding two seasoned individuals who specialize in organization and finance as well as the branding and marketing of established and emerging organizations which are poised to show significant growth.

Good Gaming conducted two closed public beta tournaments of hundreds of participants in May 2016 in order to fully vet the system. After making roughly 100 fixes and changes to the system, it now runs smoothly. The system is designed to scale to 512,000 concurrent competitors. The Company has updated the system to handle team tournaments, which will further expand its opportunity to popular titles that have tens of millions of active players and has recently launched titles that have the potential for cross-platform play among Gaming PC, Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation.

In 2017, the Company ran hundreds of tournaments on a regular basis with a dedicated customer base of over 30,000 members. Additionally, the Company expanded its website by offering content relevant to the member base with information relating to game play strategy and game news. This generated nearly 100,000 unique visits per month. In an effort to monetize that traffic, the Company employed the use of Google display advertising and tested a subscription model. After careful evaluation of the Company’s strategy, management decided to move away from free tournaments and custom content and focus on growing and monetizing our Minecraft server, which has grown substantially in popularity. This decision was a result of comprehensive competitive analysis and evaluations made in how the esports industry was shifting in its space. Tournaments and custom content are currently suspended while the Company grows revenue and focuses on expanding its efforts with Minecraft. The Company is also aggressively evaluating several business models and acquisition opportunities to resume its previous success as it is related to tournaments.
 
Business Strategy
 
In the past, our management team’s strategy was to be a full-service company providing best in class tournaments, the best platform on which they are played, and content that is all about the esports world. We have looked at this strategy and have changed the way we view our business.
 
It’s our ambition and strategy to be great at providing a place for amateurs to play. By focusing on what the gaming universe is lacking, it allows us to focus on the promotion of teams, leagues and competition. We will continue with this strategy because over this past year, we have been successful in managing the tournaments. We intend to begin with local servers and expand organically from there. We recognize there are millions of players who desire to compete within the gaming community.
 
Minecraft is another business strategy. We have a well-established server and will continue to devote resources to developing and acquiring other Minecraft assets. We feel that we have learned how to monetize this and will be able to continue to grow and have it be a meaningful part of our business strategy.
 
In our evaluation of our current business model, we have decided not to pursue the operation as a tournament platform. We feel there are too many great platforms that allow complete integration via APIs to run our tournaments. These companies have spent and continued spending millions of dollars establishing their platforms. It’s what they do very well and they rely on companies such as Good Gaming to run and host tournaments.
 
We previously developed our own code and have a platform that really is quite good to handle tournaments but needs some improvement to be commercially ready. In fact, it’s this platform that we have used up to now to run our Hearthstone tournaments. Although it is functional, the challenge is that it costs too much capital to maintain and improve the platform. At this point, it’s an asset we have and we may try to monetize this at some point.
 
We cannot provide any assurance that our focus on hosting the esports tournaments will be successful and profitable in the future or at all.
 
Insurance Policies
 
We do have an insurance policy through Berkley Insurance Company with the Insurance coverage of $1,000,000.
