Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage biotherapeutics company focused on the global biosimilar market. Biosimilars are a class of protein-based therapeutics with high similarity to approved originator products on the basis of various structural, physicochemical and biological properties, as well as in terms of safety and efficacy. Our goal is to become a global leader in the biosimilar market by leveraging our team’s collective expertise in key areas such as process science, analytical characterization, protein production, and clinical-regulatory development. 
 On September 25, 2018, we received regulatory approval for the marketing of UDENYCA™ (pegfilgrastim-cbqv), a biosimilar to Neulasta, a long-acting granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, from the European Commission. On November 2, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved our biologics license application (“BLA”) for UDENYCA™ as a biosimilar to Neulasta. We initiated U.S. sales of UDENYCA™ in January 2019.
 Our clinical-stage pipeline includes the following product candidates:
  
1) | Immunology, anti-tumor necrosis factor (“Anti-TNF”) biosimilar candidates, CHS-1420 for adalimumab (Humira®) and CHS-0214 for etanercept (Enbrel®), which have both completed Phase 3 clinical programs;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Ophthalmology biosimilar candidates, CHS-3351 for ranibizumab (Lucentis®), which is in Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) production stage and CHS-2020 for aflibercept (Eylea®), which is in preclinical development; and
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Small molecule therapeutic candidate, CHS-131, a novel, selective modulator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (“PPAR-g”), which could be for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and other metabolic conditions, and which completed a Phase 2b proof-of-concept trial in 2016 in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (“MS”), and completed a Phase 2b proof-of-concept trial in Type 2 diabetes mellitus in September 2009.

Oncology Biosimilar
 UDENYCA™ stimulates production of granulocytes (a type of white blood cell) in order to promote the body’s ability to fight infections. We completed two pivotal pharmacokinetic (“PK”) and pharmacodynamic (“PD”) studies for UDENYCA™ in the U.S. comparing UDENYCA™ to Neulasta, for which we reported topline results in October 2015 and in July 2016. Both studies met their primary PD endpoints of absolute neutrophil count (“ANC”). In terms of PK parameters, the first study also met bioequivalence for Cmax, but the Area Under the Curve (“AUC”) portion of the PK results did not meet bioequivalence due to the presence of a low, anomalous PK profile in the first treatment period Neulasta group and a relatively small sample size for the observed biological variability. We initiated the second follow-on PK/PD study in February 2016, which met all its primary clinical PK/PD endpoints. In January 2016, we completed an immunogenicity study in healthy volunteers. In August 2016, we submitted a BLA for UDENYCA™ to the FDA under Section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (“351(k) BLA”), which enables an applicant to pursue approval of a product candidate as a biosimilar. We received a complete response letter (“CRL”) regarding this BLA from the FDA in June 2017. We resubmitted the BLA in May 2018, and the FDA approved the BLA for UDENYCA™ in November 2018. In October 2016, we filed a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), which was approved by the European Commission (“EC”) in September 2018. We initiated U.S. sales of UDENYCA™ in January 2019. 
 Anti-TNF Biosimilars
 Our first anti-TNF product candidate, CHS-1420, is an adalimumab (Humira) biosimilar candidate. We completed a Phase 3 study in psoriasis patients with top line 12-week data released in August 2016, followed by positive confirmatory results at 24-weeks in January 2017, all to support a planned filing of a marketing application in the United States. If approved, we anticipate we would be able to launch CHS-1420 in the U.S. on or after December 15, 2023, in accordance with settlement and license agreements with AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie”) that grant Coherus global, non-exclusive license rights under AbbVie’s intellectual property to commercialize CHS-1420.
 Our second anti-TNF product candidate, CHS-0214, is an etanercept (Enbrel) biosimilar candidate. We have global rights to CHS-0214, excluding certain Caribbean and Latin American countries, except for Brazil where we retain rights to CHS-0214. We have completed two Phase 3 clinical trials with CHS-0214 in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, which met their primary clinical endpoints in November 2015 and January 2016, respectively.

Ophthalmology Biosimilars
 Our preclinical stage pipeline consists of CHS-3351, a ranibizumab (Lucentis) biosimilar product candidate, and CHS-2020, an aflibercept (Eylea) biosimilar candidate. We are executing GMP manufacturing to support clinical studies in humans for CHS-3351. We are conducting certain preclinical activities for CHS-2020, such as process development and biosimilarity exercises.
 Overview of the Market Opportunity for Biosimilars
 According to Evaluate Pharma, total global annual revenues from adalimumab, etanercept and pegfilgrastim-based originator products exceeded $32 billion in 2018. We intend to pursue a branded strategy to address the potential commercial opportunity, emphasizing a high level of similarity of our biosimilar products to the originators, while offering significantly more value to the United States healthcare system. 
 The global market opportunity for biosimilars is large and growing because of several factors. First, many of the top-grossing biologic drugs in the world faced, or are facing the expiry of their patent protection within the next five years. Second, regulatory agencies around the world have responded to these upcoming patent expirations by defining new biosimilar approval pathways. We believe these regulatory initiatives will help streamline the approval process across various international regulatory agencies and encourage growth of the overall biosimilar market. Third, implementation of more stringent cost containment practices on the part of governments and insurers has increased demand for high-quality biosimilars, which we believe will result in substantial market growth over time. Further, in the United States, the largest market globally, we believe that government policy mandating healthcare insurance coverage of treatments for pre-existing conditions will continue for the foreseeable future and will increase demand for high-quality biosimilars. 
 While the potential market opportunity is significant, biosimilar product development poses a number of scientific, regulatory and technical challenges that distinguish it from traditional, small-molecule generic product development. We believe our world-class team of biologic therapeutic developers and renowned scientists gives us the critical capabilities to successfully address the complexities underlying these challenges. With the approval of UDENYCA™, we believe we have demonstrated our core capabilities and expertise in product development. We have also assembled a distinguished scientific advisory board of leading scientists who are acknowledged experts in their respective fields. 
 Our business model places our internal team at the center of a coordinated development effort in which our senior team of experts focuses on the highly-specialized, strategic and technical aspects of biosimilar development. For other aspects of our operations that require greater scale or more capital-intensive investments, we have established a network of relationships with highly-competent external organizations and strategic partnerships that we believe will provide the competitive scale required to address the global biosimilar market opportunity. For example, in December 2015, we entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement with KBI Biopharma, Inc. (“KBI Biopharma”) for long-term commercial manufacturing of UDENYCA™. In December 2017, we issued and sold an aggregate of 776,104 shares of common stock to KBI Biopharma, in a private placement transaction for gross consideration of $6.8 million. In November 2018, we extended our partnership with KBI until December 31, 2023. In addition, our dynamic organization allows us to respond to the rapidly evolving biosimilar landscape. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to become a leading global biosimilar company. The key elements of our strategy include: 
  
• | Maximizing the commercial opportunity of UDENYCA™, our first commercial-stage biosimilar drug in the United States. We believe our commercial team possesses a deep understanding of the buy-and-bill, oncology biologics marketplace. With UDENYCA™, we believe we are able to effectively provide value and choice without compromise to patients, physicians, group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), and payers seeking to use pegfilgrastim at lower prices. Originator biologic drug price increases represent a significant burden to the U.S. healthcare system and we believe high-quality, high-value biosimilars such as UDENYCA™ can help lower that burden. With UDENYCA™ approved in Europe, we are also open to partnering the product in Europe.

• | Advancing our lead programs through clinical development to secure approvals in major markets. We have developed a late-stage clinical pipeline consisting of two product candidates, CHS-1420 and CHS-0214, for which we plan to submit 351(k) BLAs in the United States. We attempt to adapt our clinical trials to meet the regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions globally, such that one set of pivotal clinical trials may be sufficient for approval in all jurisdictions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing to advance our early-stage product pipeline. We will apply our team’s expertise and our platform to identify and pursue multiple additional biosimilar product opportunities. In addition to our clinical-stage product candidate portfolio, we have identified two potential product candidates, CHS-3351, a ranibizumab (Lucentis) biosimilar product candidate, and CHS-2020, an aflibercept (Eylea) biosimilar candidate, that have met our stringent selection criteria and which have entered early development. We will continue to evaluate other potential product candidates to further expand our pipeline.

• | Leveraging our platform and internal expertise in process science, molecular biology and protein production, as well as our clinical, regulatory and commercial strategies, to screen and select biosimilar candidates. Our team possesses a deep understanding of the technical advancements that enable the development of biosimilars. We believe we are able to effectively select product candidates using a stringent process that factors in technical feasibility, size of originator products opportunity and market receptivity to biosimilars, as well as other criteria.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximizing the value of our portfolio and pipeline by retaining commercial rights to our biosimilar candidates in the U.S. We intend to retain U.S. rights to our biosimilar products and product candidates, while opportunistically licensing rights in other geographic areas in exchange for upfront, cost sharing, milestone and royalty payments depending on legal and other developments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Attracting and retaining exceptionally capable team members who share our vision of bringing high quality, lower cost biologic therapeutics to patients. We value the experience that has been gained by our veteran team members over the course of decades in the biotechnology industry as essential for execution at all stages of biosimilar product development. We believe that our level of technical expertise is rare, difficult for others to replicate and a basis for screening those who would join our team. We intend to maintain the capabilities that will enable us to realize our vision of expanding patient access to high quality, lower cost biologic therapeutics globally.

Background on Biosimilars 
 Significant Market Opportunity 
 According to IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, the 2017 U.S. biologics market represented over $120 billion in sales, with virtually the entire market composed of branded originator products. Patent expirations for many commercially successful branded biologic products will provide an unprecedented opportunity for cost containment through the introduction of biosimilars. Through 2023, and potentially beyond, 26 major branded biologic products, all with worldwide annual sales in excess of $1 billion each, face loss of patent exclusivity in at least one major pharmaceutical market. These products achieved over $100 billion in aggregate worldwide sales in 2018. We believe this wave of patent expirations will create significant opportunities in the coming years. The following originator products (all of which are “blockbuster” biologics) are facing loss of patent exclusivity in at least one major market through 2023: 

Actemra Advate Avastin Botox Enbrel Eylea Forteo | Herceptin Humira Kadcyla Kogenate Lantus Levemir Lucentis | Neulasta Norditropin SimpleXx NovoMix 30 NovoRapid Orencia Remicade Rituxan | Simponi Stelara Tysabri Victoza Xolair
-------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------

 Escalating healthcare costs and healthcare reform have been major drivers for the advancement of the biosimilar market. Governments and insurers are in search of mechanisms to contain costs and expand patient access without sacrificing quality of care. Further, governments and commercial payers are using an increasing and disproportionate amount of healthcare spending on biologic therapeutics. IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science reported in 2018 that spend related to biologic medicines increased by 56% in the last five years in the U.S. Compounding the issue is the fact that biologic therapeutic costs are escalating at an increasingly unsustainable rate. Consequently, we believe there is tremendous cost pressure to bring high-quality, lower-priced biologic therapeutics to market. We further believe our products target payer segments having among the highest rates of spending and anticipated spending growth, including inflammation and cancer.
 We expect the biosimilar marketplace to have several distinct characteristics as it develops. We believe that the market adoption and penetration rates for biosimilars in the U.S. will primarily be determined by three key factors: (1) biosimilar product quality, as demonstrated by the development program in alignment with the 351(k) pathway, (2) supply reliability, including the ability to meet market demand rapidly and consistently and (3) delivering incremental value to payers, providers and patients. We believe there will be strong market adoption and penetration for UDENYCA™ and, if approved, our biosimilar pipeline candidates due to the quality of our products our U.S.-based supply chain and our value offering to payers, providers and patients. We believe that there will be substantially fewer biosimilar competitors relative to the competition experienced in the generic drug space, pricing stability, and favorable market dynamics due to the large level of capital investment and technical expertise required to develop, obtain approval for, and commercialize biosimilars. 
 The Challenge of Biosimilar Product Development 
 Proteins consist of one or more long chains of amino acids and perform a vast array of functions within living organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, responding to stimuli and transporting molecules from one location to another. Such 
 5


protein molecules differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which results in folding of the protein into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. 
 Although the sequence of amino acids in a protein is consistently replicated, there are a number of changes, called posttranslational modifications, that can occur following synthesis that create inherent variability. Chief among these is the glycosylation, or the attachment of sugars to certain amino acids. Most protein-based therapeutics, including all monoclonal antibodies, are glycosylated to some degree. Monoclonal antibodies are identical antibodies that have an affinity for the same antigen and are produced by a specific clone or cell line. The glycosylation of monoclonal antibodies and other protein-based therapeutics can be critical to half-life, efficacy and even safety of the therapeutic and is therefore a key consideration for biosimilarity. Defining and understanding the variability of an originator molecule in order to match its glycosylation profile requires significant skill in cell biology, protein purification and analytical protein chemistry. Furthermore, manufacturing proteins with reliable and consistent glycosylation profiles at scale is challenging and highly dependent on the skill of the cell biologist and process scientist. 
 Protein-based therapeutics are inherently heterogeneous and their structure is highly dependent on the production process and conditions. Products from one production facility can differ within an acceptable range from those produced in another facility. Similarly, physicochemical differences can also exist among different lots produced within a single facility. The physicochemical complexity and size of biologic therapeutics creates significant technical and scientific challenges in the context of their replication as biosimilar products. This is further exacerbated by the fact that some originator product’s quality characteristics, such as glycosylation, have been shown to change or “drift” over time. 
 Accordingly, inherent variation is a fundamental consideration with respect to establishing biosimilarity to an originator product to support regulatory approval requirements. Since the product quality characteristics of originator molecules exist as a range of values rather than as an absolute, as it is the case for small-molecule therapeutic generics, regulators have issued guidelines that require demonstration of high degree of analytical similarity and no clinically meaningful differences. 
 Our Approach 
 Five Key Steps to Biosimilar Drug Development 
 We focus our efforts around five key steps of biosimilar development that are designed to provide the analytical, nonclinical and clinical basis to establish biosimilarity and support regulatory approval of our product candidates. We have had meetings with regulatory agencies in several of the major regulated markets to discuss our three most advanced product candidates and the data that will be required to support marketing approval. The outcomes of these discussions have informed our clinical designs, product development and regulatory strategies.
Step 1: Cell Line Development and Manufacturing 
 The amino acid sequence of the candidate biosimilar molecule must precisely match that of the originator. We validate the amino acid sequence of all candidate biosimilar products prior to developing clones. While all clones are expected to produce proteins with the same primary sequence, it is essential to select clones that produce protein that most closely matches the posttranslational modifications of the originator, since such product quality characteristics impact PK, and/or PD, properties as well as safety and efficacy of the molecule. A process to manufacture the desired product must be developed, scaled-up and implemented in a GMP facility in order to be used in human clinical trials. 
Step 2: Analytical Characterization and In Vitro Comparability 
 Once a biosimilar product candidate has been manufactured, we use sophisticated analytical methods and equipment as well as highly trained analysts in order to detect, analyze and interpret the structural and physiochemical similarity between our biosimilar candidate and the originator product. We also evaluate functional similarity by determining biologic activity of our biosimilar candidate and the originator product using a battery of sensitive in vitro pharmacology assays that assess known, likely and plausible mechanisms of action for all approved indications of the originator product. These data may be predictive of clinically relevant differences in PK, PD, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity between our biosimilar candidate and the originator product. 
Step 3: In Vivo Animal Comparability 
 In addition to the assessment of analytical similarity, we may compare our biosimilar product candidate to the originator product in relevant animal models.
 6


Steps 4 and 5: Clinical Studies 
 Once biosimilarity has been established in the first three steps, the goal of the clinical program is to demonstrate that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product candidate and the originator product in terms of safety, purity, and potency of the product. The FDA expects a biosimilar product sponsor to conduct comparative human PK and PD studies (if there is a relevant PD measure) and a clinical immunogenicity assessment. In certain cases, such as where there is a high correlation between PD and PK profiles and clinical effectiveness, the results from these studies alone may provide adequate clinical data to support approval. If there is any residual uncertainty about whether clinically meaningful differences may exist between the biosimilar product candidate and the originator product based on any of the above required testing, a comparative Phase 3 or confirmatory clinical study will be necessary.
Step 4: Pivotal Phase 1 Human Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study and Clinical Immunogenicity Assessment
 An essential global regulatory requirement is the completion of a clinical study in a sufficient number of human subjects directly comparing the originator product and our biosimilar product candidate to establish PK/PD and immunogenicity similarity. The U.S. and European regulatory agencies have established requirements for bioequivalence with respect to three prospectively defined parameters as follows: 

• | C max: maximum measured serum concentration;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | AUC 0 - t: area under the concentration-time curve from the first time point measured (0) to the last time point measured (t); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AUC 0-inf: area under the concentration-time curve from the first time point measured (0) extrapolated to infinity.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The AUC is a measure of how much of a drug is in a patient’s system over a given time period. In order to calculate the AUC, the concentration of the drug in blood serum or plasma is plotted over time starting at the time the drug is administered and ending when the last time point is collected (AUC 0-t ) or when the serum or plasma concentration would be below the level of detection or zero (AUC 0- inf ), and then the area under this curve is calculated. To be deemed bioequivalent, regulators require that, for each parameter, the ratio of the originator product and the biosimilar candidate fall within 80% and 125%, with the identical match being at 100%. 
 In addition to the demonstration of PK biosimilarity (similar levels of exposure to the biologic at different time points), these studies should also measure, when possible, PD biosimilarity (similar exposure-response to the biologic) to assess whether there are any potential clinically meaningful differences between the two products. Potential PD biomarkers are specific to each reference product and should demonstrate characteristics of the product’s target effects. For each PD biomarker, it is important to consider: 
 1) its time of onset relative to dosing;
 2) its dynamic range over the exposure range; 
 3) its sensitivity to differences between the biosimilar product candidate and the originator product; 
 4) its relevance to the mechanism of action of the drug; and
 5) the analytical validity of the assay.
 The goal of the clinical immunogenicity assessment is to evaluate potential differences between the biosimilar product candidate and the originator product in the incidence and severity of the human immune response. Immune responses may impact both efficacy and safety by altering PK, inducing anaphylaxis, or by generating neutralizing antibodies (“NAb”) that neutralize the protein product, thereby hindering its efficacy.
 Step 5: Phase 3 or Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Clinical Trials 
 If the above clinical comparisons, including PK and PD comparisons and immunogenicity studies, do not sufficiently rule out the possibility of clinically meaningful differences between the products, then a comparative clinical study will be required to support approval. This may be a single Phase 3 or a smaller confirmatory safety and efficacy study in a therapeutic indication for which the originator product has been approved. The objective of this study is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the originator product and biosimilar product candidate with respect to safety and efficacy. Subject to discussions with regulators and agreement on trial endpoints, we strive to demonstrate that our biosimilar products are as effective and safe as the originator and has a similar safety profile as the originator product with no clinically meaningful differences. We also work with the regulatory agencies to ensure that a successful trial in a particular indication will lead to extrapolation and approval of all indications that the originator product has unless one or more indications are prohibited for regulatory exclusivity reasons. Trial endpoints include considerations such as the number of subjects, statistical significance, confidence intervals and accumulated safety database size.

Oncology Biosimilar Product Opportunity 
 UDENYCA™ (pegfilgrastim-cbqv) 
 Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (“G-CSF”) is a protein that promotes the survival, proliferation (an increase in the number of cells due to cell growth and cell division) and differentiation of certain types of white blood cells known as neutrophils. Recombinant G-CSF therapies, such as filgrastim (Neupogen) and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), are commonly used in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in cancer, which is characterized by an abnormally low level of neutrophils and other white blood cells that aid in the defense against infections. Neulasta revenues in the U.S. were approximately $3.9 billion in 2018.
Product Overview 
 Neulasta, the reference product for UDENYCA™, is a PEGylated form of the recombinant human G-CSF analog, filgrastim. Filgrastim produced from E. coli is not glycosylated. We have performed extensive analytical characterization of UDENYCA™ and have determined that its basic and higher-order structures are similar to Neulasta. We have also performed in vitro characterization of the biological activity of UDENYCA™. The biological effect of UDENYCA™ on neutrophils was assessed by measuring the proliferation of NFS-60 cells that are commercially available hematopoietic cells (blood cells that give rise to other blood cells) of neutrophilic lineage expressing G-CSF receptors and have been used extensively for testing G-CSF products. The biological activity of UDENYCA™ (proliferation of NFS-60 cells) is a consequence of its binding to G-CSF receptors expressed on NFS-60 cells, activation of this receptor and induction of the proliferation. We determined that UDENYCA™ stimulated the proliferation of the NFS-60 cells in a manner consistent with that observed with Neulasta. 
 Neulasta is approved in the U.S. and Europe and is indicated as a treatment to reduce the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anticancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia.

Current Development Status and Data
 The EC granted marketing authorization to UDENYCA™ in September 2018 and the FDA approved UDENYCA™ in November 2018. 
 Step 1: Cell Line Development and Manufacturing 
 We confirmed that the amino acid sequence of UDENYCA™ is identical to the originator molecule. UDENYCA™ is manufactured in E. coli and PEGylation occurs as a subsequent step in the manufacturing process. For PEGylation of UDENYCA™, we used the equivalent polyethylene glycol (“PEG”), molecule as Neulasta and established that chemistry and site of attachment of the PEG molecule was the same. In December 2015, we entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement with KBI Biopharma for long-term commercial manufacturing of UDENYCA™.
Step 2: Analytical Characterization and In Vitro Comparability 
 Filgrastim produced from E. coli is not glycosylated. We performed extensive analytical characterization of UDENYCA™ and have determined its basic and higher-order structures are similar to Neulasta. We studied the in vitro activity of UDENYCA™ in an assay measuring the proliferation of the murine myeloid leukemia cell line, NFS-60. UDENYCA™ stimulated the proliferation of the NFS-60 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent with the proliferation seen with Neulasta. 
Step 3: In Vivo Animal Comparability 
 With UDENYCA™, we have performed two preclinical pharmacology/toxicology studies: a two-week study in rats and a four-week study in monkeys. We performed a two-week rat study to characterize the toxicity and pharmacodynamics of UDENYCA™ administered every four days for two weeks, with a recovery period of one week compared to Neulasta. Doses ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg. There was no mortality during the study and no systemic signs of toxicity could be attributed to treatment. There were no differences in clinical observations between the control and treated animals. Dose-proportional increases in absolute neutrophil count (“ANC”), and total white blood cell count were observed at all dose levels of UDENYCA™. Clinical chemistry findings and mild to moderate splenic enlargement in the UDENYCA™-treated animals were consistent with the pharmacological effects of treatment with Neulasta. 
 We designed a second pharmacology/toxicology study in animals to characterize PK and PD profiles as well as the potential for harmful antibody responses to UDENYCA™ or other toxic effects, in order to compare these attributes observed for UDENYCA™ with those we observed for Neulasta. We administered either UDENYCA™ or Neulasta at dose levels of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks. We found that UDENYCA™ performed in a manner similar to Neulasta in that it increased the production of white blood cells in the bone marrow and resulted in an increase in the amount of white blood cells in the blood, in the bone marrow and in lymphoid tissues such as spleen and thymus tissue. Moreover, we found no differences between UDENYCA™ and Neulasta in terms of potentially harmful antibody responses or other toxicities, or in terms of PK and PD. 
 Steps 4 and 5: Clinical Studies 
 All clinical studies were conducted in healthy subjects, with mutual consensus with the FDA and EMA, for the following reasons:
 1) the mode of action of pegfilgrastim, to increase circulating neutrophils, is identical in healthy subjects and patients receiving chemotherapy;
 2) healthy subjects are the more sensitive study population to evaluate similarity or differences in PK, PD, and immunogenicity compared to potentially immunocompromised cancer patients; and 
 3) the most common side effects of pegfilgrastim (bone pain and headache) is the same in healthy subjects and cancer patients and are self-limiting and short-lived.
 The pharmacodynamic effect of pegfilgrastim, to increase circulating neutrophils, is in fact representative of the drug’s efficacy. Therefore, the demonstration of biosimilarity in PK, PD, and immunogenicity was sufficient to demonstrate no clinically meaningful differences between UDENYCA™ and Neulasta and FDA did not require us to conduct a Phase 3 clinical study in support of the 351(k) BLA.
 Step 4: Pivotal Phase 1 Human Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study 
 In March 2015, after receiving written feedback from the FDA on our development plan for UDENYCA™, we initiated a pivotal Phase 1 PK/PD study for UDENYCA™ under the 351(k) (biosimilar) pathway in the U.S., which was completed in October 2015. This study met its primary PD endpoints for ANC (“absolute neutrophil counts”). The primary PD endpoints consisted of area under the ANC–time curve calculated from time 0 to the last measured time point (ANC AUC0–last and ANC AUC0–960) and peak neutrophil count (ANCmax). In terms of PK parameters, the study also met bioequivalence for Cmax. However, the AUC portion of the PK results did not 
 9


meet bioequivalence due to a relatively small sample size for the observed biological variability in the overall study population and the presence of a low, anomalous PK profile in the first treatment period Neulasta group.
 We then initiated our pivotal PK/PD and confirmatory safety and efficacy study in the first quarter of 2016 and successfully completed that study in July 2016. This study was considered by us and FDA as our confirmatory efficacy study due to the increase in sample size and other clinical trial design features. This second study met all of its endpoints for PK, C max and AUC, and for PD, absolute neutrophil count (ANC max and ANC AUC). For both PK and PD endpoints, the 90% confidence intervals for the geometric mean ratio (“GMR”) were well contained within the pre-specified margins of 80% to 125%. This randomized, single-blind, three-sequence, three-period crossover study in healthy subjects assessed PK, PD, and safety (including immunogenicity) of a 6 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection of UDENYCA™ compared to 6 mg SC dose of Neulasta. A total of 122 healthy volunteer subjects were randomized to one of three treatment sequences, each with three treatments (Neulasta/Neulasta/ UDENYCA™ or UDENYCA™/Neulasta/Neulasta or Neulasta/ UDENYCA™/Neulasta). Subject inclusion criteria, procedures and study design, as well as other measures, reflected modifications addressing findings in the previous PK/PD studies, successfully decreasing subject variability and eliminating the extreme subject outliers previously observed.
 Step 5: Further Studies Supporting 351(k) BLA Regulatory Filing. 
 Between November 2012 and March 2013, we conducted our first-in-man Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, two-period crossover study to assess the PK profile, safety and activity of a single subcutaneous 6 mg dose of UDENYCA™ compared to Neulasta in 78 healthy human subjects. The UDENYCA™ drug product used for this study was not representative of the commercial drug product used in later studies. This Phase 1 study did not establish bioequivalence necessary to support a 351(k) BLA development pathway. In October 2014, we met with the FDA to discuss our development plan for UDENYCA™ and proceeded with the studies described above in step 4 and below in step 5. In the 351(k) BLA, this study was included in the integrated safety analysis. 
 In May 2015, we initiated an immunogenicity study in healthy volunteers, which was completed in January 2016. Each subject received two sequential doses of UDENYCA™ or two sequential doses of Neulasta. Predefined success criteria for the study included the co-endpoints, NAb and anti-drug antibodies (“ADA”). The primary endpoints were predefined and reviewed by the FDA. The study met both of its co-primary endpoints with the assays used at the time. There were no treatment-emergent NAbs detected in any subject in either treatment group.
 We submitted the 351(k) BLA in August 2016, which was accepted for filing by the FDA in October 2016. We received a CRL regarding this BLA from the FDA in June 2017. The CRL included a request from FDA for the reanalysis of immunogenicity samples from the study started in May 2015 using revised and validated immunogenicity assays. The revised assays were designed to better understand the impact of ADA on PK parameters and the differences in antibodies to the PEG or G-CSF components of pegfilgrastim. The reanalysis demonstrated that there were no treatment-emergent NAbs in either treatment group and the majority of ADA generated in both the UDENYCA™ and Neulasta treatment groups were antibodies to the PEG component. Furthermore, there were no clinically meaningful differences between UDENYCA™ and Neulasta in the ADA to the G-CSF component. The CRL also requested certain additional manufacturing related process information, which we provided. We resubmitted the 351(k) BLA for UDENYCA™ in May 2018 and the FDA approved UDENYCA™ in November 2018.
 Immunology (Anti-TNF) Product Opportunity 
 Tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) belongs to a family of soluble protein mediators (“cytokines”) that play an important role in disease progression across a number of inflammatory and chronic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s Disease, psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. Cytokines, such as TNF, are substances produced by cells in the body that can cause a biological effect on other cells in the body. TNF is generally understood as the “master regulator” of the body’s immune response and is the key initiator of immune-mediated inflammation in multiple organ systems. Several biologic agents have been developed that inhibit the inflammatory activity of TNF in the context of these diseases, which are collectively referred to as the anti-TNF class of therapeutics. Anti-TNF products with significant global sales include adalimumab (Humira), etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), golimumab (Simponi) and certolizumab pegol injection (Cimzia). These products share a common mechanism of action in that they inhibit TNF, but differ in their dosing schedules as well as the indications for which they are approved.
CHS-1420 (Our Adalimumab (Humira) Biosimilar Candidate) 
 Product Overview 
 Humira, which is the reference product (“originator”) for CHS-1420, is a monoclonal antibody that can bind to a substance in the body known as tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”), thereby inhibiting the known effect of this substance as a potent mediator of inflammation. Humira thus provides a therapeutic benefit for treatment of various inflammatory diseases characterized by increased 
 10


production of TNF in the body. However, it has also been demonstrated that Humira can bind to receptors on white blood cells, which may lessen the ability of the body’s immune system to fight infection. 
 Humira has been approved by the EMA and the FDA for the treatment of the following indications only when conventional therapies are not sufficiently effective: 
  
• | rheumatoid arthritis;
--+----------------------


• | juvenile idiopathic arthritis;
--+-------------------------------


• | psoriatic arthritis;
--+---------------------


• | ankylosing spondylitis;
--+------------------------


• | Crohn’s Disease;
--+-----------------


• | hidradenitis suppuritiva;
--+--------------------------


• | uveitis;
--+---------


• | ulcerative colitis; and
--+------------------------


• | plaque psoriasis.
--+------------------

 Humira has been approved by the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) for the treatment of the following indications only when conventional therapies are not sufficiently effective: 
  
• | rheumatoid arthritis;
--+----------------------


• | psoriatic arthritis;
--+---------------------


• | psoriasis; and
--+---------------


• | Behçet’s Disease.
--+------------------

 Worldwide sales of Humira are projected to exceed $20 billion in 2019, with about $15 billion in the U.S., which is the primary region in which we plan to focus our commercialization efforts. CHS-1420 will target a large global anti-TNF market, including but not limited to the worldwide market for the originator product, Humira. According to Evaluate Pharma, in 2019, sales of Humira and Enbrel worldwide are projected to exceed $26 billion. Our settlement and license agreements with AbbVie grant Coherus global, non-exclusive rights under AbbVie’s intellectual property to commercialize CHS-1420.
 Current Development Status and Data 
 We have successfully advanced CHS-1420 through steps 1 through 5 of our approach to biosimilar drug development. In August 2014, we completed a pivotal Phase 1 PK/PD study comparing CHS-1420 to Humira in healthy volunteers. This Phase 1 PK study met the primary endpoint and demonstrated bioequivalence for all prospectively defined endpoints and was conducted under an IND application in the U.S. We reached concurrence with regulatory authorities in the U.S. and Europe on the design of a harmonized global Phase 3 program to support registration in these territories. In August 2015, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in psoriasis and announced positive 12-week data from that trial in August 2016, followed by confirmatory positive 24-week results in January 2017 to support the planned filing of a marketing application in the U.S. and the E.U. in 2019 or beyond. We completed a Phase 1 PK bridging study comparing our Phase 3 material to U.S. manufactured Humira in March 2017. In January 2017, we initiated a PK study bridging to E.U. manufactured Humira and a PK study comparing U.S. Humira to E.U. Humira. If approved, we believe we will be able to extrapolate the data from our trial in psoriasis to gain approval for CHS-1420 in all the indications included in the label for Humira.
Step 1: Cell Line Development and Manufacturing 
 As with all our molecules, we matched the amino acid sequence of CHS-1420 to the originator molecule (adalimumab) prior to development and demonstrated it to be identical. We established Master Cell Banks (“MCBs”), and Working Cell Banks (“WCBs”), and transferred the manufacturing process to a U.S. CMO for manufacturing of Phase 1 study and Phase 3 clinical trial supplies. 
Step 2: Analytical Characterization and In Vitro Comparability 
 We characterized CHS-1420 and Humira using a multi-dimensional analytical study, demonstrating a high degree of similarity between CHS-1420 and Humira. Through extensive biochemical, biophysical and biological analysis we have shown that CHS-1420 has a structure and in vitro activity similar to that of Humira with respect to primary sequence (the linear sequence of the amino acids in the protein), protein folding (the structure of the protein in three dimensions, which is critical to its biological function) and charge 
 11


profiles (the overall electrical charge characteristic of the protein resulting from the electrical charges of its constituent amino acids), as well as the protein’s glycosylation profile and potency. 
 We have also demonstrated CHS-1420 to be highly similar to Humira through in vitro receptor binding studies, specifically in its ability to inhibit TNF-a mediated cell death. In all of these studies we demonstrated CHS-1420 to have similar pharmacological activity to Humira by evaluating the binding of both CHS-1420 and, Humira to Fc receptors, complement (C1q) and Fc-mediated functional activities: ADCC and CDC. 
 Step 3: In Vivo Animal Comparability 
 We conducted two nonclinical studies in monkeys in order to compare the PK and nonclinical safety profile of CHS-1420 to Humira. Following one month of repeat dosing, we determined the pharmacokinetics of CHS-1420 to be similar to that of Humira. 
Step 4: Pivotal Phase 1 Human Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study 
 In April 2014, we initiated a Phase 1 pivotal PK study in healthy adult volunteers. This is a single dose, double-blind parallel group study designed to demonstrate bioequivalence between CHS-1420 and Humira. A secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of CHS-1420 in this population. The study has been successfully completed and met the primary endpoint and demonstrated bioequivalence with respect to the three prospectively defined PK endpoints. CHS-1420 and Humira were both well tolerated in this single-dose study in healthy adult volunteers. 
 We completed a Phase 1 PK bridging study comparing our Phase 3 material to U.S. manufactured Humira in March 2017.
 Step 5: Phase 3 Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Clinical Trials 
 In August 2015, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in psoriasis that enrolled 545 subjects. This is a confirmatory, randomized, double-blind, active-control, parallel-group, three-part study in patients with active, moderate to severe, chronic plaque psoriasis. This trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating similarity between CHS-1420 and Humira with respect to percentage of subjects achieving the PASI-75 scores at 12 weeks. Both CHS-1420 and Humira were similarly well tolerated with similar safety profiles. In part two of this trial, from week 16 to week 24, half the subjects randomized to Humira crossed-over to CHS-1420, modeling a chronic patient’s transition to a biosimilar. In January 2017, we reported that maintenance of PASI-75 was similar across the three subsequent treatment groups: CHS-1420 followed by CHS-1420, Humira followed by CHS-1420, and Humira followed by Humira. CHS-1420 and Humira were similarly well tolerated in all groups during part two of the trial. In part three of the trial, all subjects will receive CHS-1420 for an additional 24 weeks. This trial would be considered the primary confirmatory safety and efficacy trial to support a registration filing.
CHS-0214 (Our Etanercept (Enbrel) Biosimilar Candidate) 
 Product Overview 
 Enbrel, the reference product for CHS-0214, is a complex fusion protein that combines the protein for tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (“TNFR-2”), to another protein (called IgG1 Fc), which enables the fusion protein to attach to cells in the body. The TNFR-2 portion of the fusion protein binds to soluble and cell bound tumor necrosis factors alpha and beta (“TNF-α” and “TNF-ß,” respectively), and inhibits TNF-α and TNF-ß from binding to cell surface proteins that recognize them. Autoimmune diseases are caused by an overactive immune response. Enbrel treats these diseases by inhibiting TNF-α, thus inhibiting the inflammatory cytokine cascade, which is a sequence of events in the body, caused by cytokines, leading to inflammation in a tissue or organ. 
 Enbrel has been approved by the EMA and the FDA for the treatment of the following indications: 
  
• | rheumatoid arthritis;
--+----------------------


• | juvenile idiopathic arthritis;
--+-------------------------------


• | psoriatic arthritis;
--+---------------------


• | ankylosing spondylitis; and
--+----------------------------


• | plaque psoriasis.
--+------------------

 Enbrel has been approved by the PMDA for the treatment of the following indications only when conventional therapies are not sufficiently effective: 
  
• | rheumatoid arthritis; and
--+--------------------------


• | juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
--+-------------------------------

 12


In 2019, sales of Enbrel are projected to exceed approximately $6.7 billion worldwide, of which $4.5 billion are expected to be generated in the U.S. We developed CHS-0214 for U.S., Europe and Japan. We have licensed CHS-0214 to Orox for certain Caribbean and Latin American countries. 
 The expiration of certain originator patents pertaining to Enbrel in major markets offers us a potential near-term opportunity to introduce a biosimilar competitor in these markets. Specifically, we believe we are not precluded by the originator’s patents from introducing an Enbrel biosimilar candidate in Europe or Japan. We intend to evaluate commercial partners to compete in these markets.
 Current Development Status and Data 
 We have successfully advanced CHS-0214 through steps 1 through 5 of our approach to biosimilar drug development. Our pivotal Phase 1 human PK/PD study was conducted in the U.S. We evaluated CHS-0214 in two randomized Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with psoriasis and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, both of which met their primary endpoints in November 2015 and January 2016, respectively. Although we could file a European marketing application for CHS-0214, we intend to prioritize approval and commercialization in the U.S. as we believe it is a more economically attractive market. If approved, we believe we will be able to extrapolate the data from our trials in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis to gain approval for CHS-0214 in all the indications included in the label for Enbrel.
Step 1: Cell Line Development and Manufacturing 
 We have identified the amino acid sequence of CHS-0214 and confirmed that it is identical to the reference product, Enbrel. We established MCBs and WCBs, and produced toxicology materials in the third quarter of 2012 and Phase 1 study materials at a U.S. contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”). We then transferred the manufacturing process to a European CMO for Phase 3 clinical trial supply and to another European CMO for subsequent commercialization. 
Step 2: Analytical Characterization and In Vitro Comparability 
 We demonstrated CHS-0214 similarity to Enbrel with respect to key physicochemical properties that determine PK/PD, safety and efficacy using a broad spectrum of analytical methods. Through in vitro receptor binding studies, including Fc receptors, complement (C1q) and Fc-mediated functional activities (i.e., antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (“ADCC”), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (“CDC”)), we have shown CHS-0214 to have highly similar pharmacological activity to Enbrel. ADCC and CDC refer to biological mechanisms of immune system defense, which facilitate the body’s ability to use its immune system to target and destroy a given target cell. Comparing the effects of CHS-0214 and Enbrel on these mechanisms provides us a basis for determining how similar CHS-0214 is to Enbrel in terms of pharmacological activity. 
Step 3: In Vivo Animal Comparability 
 We compared CHS-0214 to Enbrel in a single-dose PK study and a 28-day study in evaluating toxicity and PK in cynomolgus monkeys and no appreciable differences were identified. 
Step 4: Pivotal Phase 1 Human Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study 
 We announced the Phase 1 PK similarity study results for CHS-0214 in October 2013. This study was a single dose cross-over study conducted in 60 healthy adult human volunteers to evaluate the PK and safety of CHS-0214 compared to Enbrel. CHS-0214 met the primary endpoint of clinical PK similarity to Enbrel with the study demonstrating a 98% correlation between CHS-0214 and Enbrel. We also collected safety data in all subjects and both CHS-0214 and Enbrel were well tolerated. Treatment emergent adverse events were similar for each treatment and treatment period, and there were no unusual or unexpected or serious adverse events related to either product. There were no clinically meaningful differences in other safety parameters observed during this study. 
 Due to the change in the manufacturing location from the U.S. to the E.U., we conducted an additional Phase 1 PK similarity study comparing CHS-0214 to one lot of Enbrel manufactured in Europe, which met its primary endpoint in April 2015. The design of this study was a single-dose, cross-over study similar to the one described above. 
 In 2016, we initiated a Phase 1 PK bioequivalence study comparing E.U. Enbrel to CHS-0214 produced under a new process and also initiated a Phase 1 PK comparability study comparing CHS-0214 produced under a new process and CHS-0214 under a former process and used in the two Phase 3 trials. We completed these two studies in October 2016. The Phase 1 PK bioequivalence study achieved the primary PK bioequivalence endpoint. The Phase 1 PK comparability study provided additional relative bioavailability data for CHS-0214.

Step 5: Phase 3 Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Clinical Trials
 We announced the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis clinical trial in June 2014, and subsequently initiated a separate Phase 3 clinical trial in psoriasis in July 2014. The design of each Phase 3 clinical trial incorporated guidance from regulatory agencies regarding key study parameters. 
 The Phase 3 clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis was designed as a double blind, multi-center, parallel group study in which patients with DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug)-refractory active rheumatoid arthritis were put on a stable dose of methotrexate. This trial enrolled 647 subjects who were randomized 1:1 to CHS-0214 50 mg or Enbrel 50 mg, administered subcutaneously weekly over a period of 24 weeks. Following the initial 24-week double-blind period, all patients were moved to a CHS-0214 treatment for a period of 6 months. In January 2016, the trial met its primary end-point of the proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 (20% improvement according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria) at 24 weeks, which was within the pre-specified margins for demonstrating equivalence of CHS-0214 compared to Enbrel. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and immunogenicity profiles of the two products.
 The Phase 3 clinical trial in psoriasis was designed as a double-blind, parallel group, multi-center study in patients with active psoriasis. This trial enrolled 521 patients who were randomized 1:1 to CHS-0214 or Enbrel, 50 mg administered subcutaneously twice weekly for the first 12 weeks, switching to once weekly and continuing in the same treatment arms for an additional 40 weeks, which included four weeks of follow-up. In November 2015, this trial met its primary efficacy endpoint of mean percent change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (“PASI”), from baseline and the proportion of subjects achieving a 75% improvement in the PASI from baseline (“PASI-75”), scores at 12 weeks.
 In July 2015, we initiated an open-label, safety extension study (“OLSES”) evaluating the longer-term safety and durability of response of subjects who completed 48 weeks in the confirmatory safety and efficacy Phase 3 trials of CHS-0214 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. We enrolled 359 subjects in this study, which completed treatment in October 2017. The maintenance of ACR20 response or 50% improvement in the PASI response was achieved in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, respectively, and results of secondary and other efficacy assessments demonstrated maintenance of clinical response over time. The safety data of this study were consistent with the known Enbrel literature. In addition, no new safety signals were identified with up to an additional 109 weeks of treatment with CHS-0214.
 Ophthalmology Product Opportunity 
 CHS-3351 (Our Ranibizumab (Lucentis) Biosimilar Candidate) 
 Lucentis is a monoclonal antibody fragment (“Fab”) created from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab and produced through a microbial culture. It is an anti-angiogenic that has been first approved to treat age-related wet macular degeneration, (“AMD”). Like bevacizumab Lucentis blocks angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A.
 According to Evaluate Pharma, Lucentis achieved approximately $3.6 billion in worldwide sales in 2018, and is expected to decrease to approximately $3.1 billion in 2020, when the composition of matter patent on ranibizumab expires in the U.S. We selected Lucentis as the biosimilar development target for our biosimilar, CHS-3351, to leverage the analytics deployed on bevacizumab and because we could address a concentrated market where we believe we can focus resources and establish a therapeutic franchise. 
 Lucentis has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of the following indications: 
 14


 
• | Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Macular edema following retinal vein occlusion;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Diabetic macular edema;
--+------------------------


• | Diabetic retinopathy; and
--+--------------------------


• | Myopic choroidal neovascularization.
--+-------------------------------------

Current Development Status and Data
 Step 1: Cell Line Development and Manufacturing
 We have identified the amino acid sequence of CHS-3351 and confirmed that it is identical to the reference product, Lucentis. We have established a MCB as well as a WCB. We completed certain GMP manufacturing efforts in support of clinical studies in humans. We are currently transferring the manufacturing process of CHS-3351 bulk drug substance to a new CMO in the U.S. for production of material to supply preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
CHS-2020 (Our Aflibercept (Eylea) Biosimilar Candidate) 
 Eylea, the reference product for CHS-2020, is a complex fusion protein that combines the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-binding portions from the extracellular domains of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2, that are fused to the Fc portion of the human IgG1 immunoglobulin and binds to circulating VEGFs.
 According to Evaluate Pharma, Eylea achieved approximately $7.0 billion in worldwide sales in 2018, and is expected to remain stable at that level until 2023, when it loses market exclusivity in the U.S. We selected Eylea as a biosimilar development target because we could address a concentrated market where we believe we can focus resources and establish a therapeutic franchise. 
 Eylea has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of the following indications:
  
• | Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Macular edema following retinal vein occlusion; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Diabetic retinopathy.
--+----------------------

Current Development Status and Data
 Step 1: Cell Line Development and Manufacturing
 We have identified the amino acid sequence of CHS-2020 and confirmed that it is identical to the protein in the reference product, Eylea. We are currently in preclinical development.
Early-Stage Biosimilar Pipeline
 We are continuously performing product opportunity reviews of additional biosimilar pipeline candidates in conjunction with our scientific advisory board.

Small Molecule Therapeutic Candidate in Development
 CHS-131 is a potential novel, first-in-class, well-tolerated, once-daily oral drug candidate under development for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and other metabolic conditions. CHS-131 is a selective ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma (“PPARγ”) which is part of a family of nuclear receptors that are expressed in a broad range of tissues and regulate multiple metabolic processes. PPARγ plays a central role in regulating storage and metabolism of dietary fats, and is a relevant target in conditions with loss of normal adipocyte function, hypoadiponectinemia and insulin resistance. The activation of PPARγ drives adiponectin expression and insulin sensitization, addressing a core issue that underpins the NASH disease process. PPARγ is a clinically validated target in NASH by pioglitazone, which is recognized in the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (“AASLD”) guidelines.
 CHS-131 has a novel chemical scaffold, unrelated to thiazolidinediones. CHS-131 has demonstrated an improved safety profile from thiazolidinediones in preclinical and clinical testing, and has been administered to over 600 human subjects in multiple clinical studies. 
 In June 2016, we reported positive Phase 2b efficacy data on CHS-131 in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (“MS”). This six-month study demonstrated significant reduction in contrast-enhancing lesions meeting its primary endpoint. CHS-131 was generally well-tolerated and without evidence of immune suppression or the side-effects commonly seen in other oral MS therapies.
 Results of a positive Phase 2b study of CHS-131 in Type 2 diabetes mellitus were published in 2014. This six month randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of four doses (0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg) of CHS-131 in comparison to 45 mg of pioglitazone in 367 subjects on a background of sulfonylurea or sulfonylurea plus metformin, demonstrated a steep dose response for efficacy as measured by changes in HbA1c. The 2-mg dose demonstrated near-maximal efficacy, which was not statistically different from the efficacy of 45 mg of pioglitazone.
 NASH is a highly prevalent serious condition with no approved therapies. It is part of the spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”) and is characterized by hepatic fat deposition with inflammation, accumulating fibrosis, and ultimately liver cirrhosis. NASH-related cirrhosis is currently a leading cause of chronic liver disease and is associated with hepatocellular cancer. It is estimated to become the leading cause of liver transplant in the United States by 2020. The U.S. prevalence of NASH is expected to reach 27 million by 2030.
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our strategy is to retain commercial rights to our biosimilar products in the U.S. For UDENYCATM, the sales call points in the U.S. are highly concentrated and addressable by a relatively small commercial organization, the preservation of U.S. rights allows us the flexibility to cost effectively build our own commercial capability.
 For our other biosimilar and small molecule drug candidates (CHS-1420, CHS-0214, CHS-3351, CHS-2020 and CHS-131), we seek to license rights regionally or globally to commercially proficient partners. 
 Manufacturing 
 We have entered into agreements with several CMOs for the manufacture and clinical drug supply for our lead products candidates. We continue to screen other contract manufacturers to meet our clinical, commercial and regulatory supply requirements on a product-by-product basis. In December 2015, we entered into a strategic commercial supply agreement with KBI Biopharma for the supply of UDENYCA™. For a discussion of risks related to our sources and availability of supplies, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Ability to Hire Highly Qualified Personnel and Our Reliance on Third Parties.”
Competition 
 The development and commercialization of protein-based therapeutics is highly competitive. While we believe that our biologics platform, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources. Such competition includes larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, generic pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as originator companies and any other firms developing the biosimilars that would compete with the product candidates in our pipeline and other novel products with similar indications. 
 UDENYCA™ faces competition from Amgen (which holds rights to Neulasta, the reference product of UDENYCA™), and Mylan N.V. (“Mylan”), and may face competition from Sandoz International GmbH (“Sandoz”), Apotex Inc. (“Apotex”) and Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”).
 CHS-1420 may face competition from AbbVie (the holder of rights to Humira, the reference product of CHS-1420), Amgen (which has a biosimilar to Humira (AmjevitaTM) approved in the U.S. and (AmgevitaTM / SolymbicTM) approved in the E.U.), Sandoz, (which has a biosimilar to Humira (HyrimozTM) approved in the E.U.), Samsung Bioepis (which has a biosimilar to Humira (ImraldiTM) 
 16


approved in the E.U.), Pfizer, Mylan, Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Momenta”), Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics Co., Ltd (“Fujifilm”), Fresenius Kabi (“Fresenius”), and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH (“Boehringer Ingelheim”) (which has a biosimilar to Humira (CyltezoTM) approved in the U.S. and E.U.).
 CHS-0214 may compete with products developed by Pfizer, (which holds ex-North America rights to Enbrel, the reference product of CHS-0214), Sandoz (which has a biosimilar to Enbrel (ErelziTM) approved in the U.S. and in the E.U.), Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd. (“Samsung Bioepis”), which has an approved biosimilar to Enbrel (BenepaliTM) in the E.U., Lupin Limited (“Lupin”), and LG Chem, Ltd. (“LG”). 
 CHS-3351 may face competition from Genentech USA, Inc. (the holder of rights to Lucentis, the reference product of CHS-3351), as well as Pfenex Inc., Samsung Bioepis, Xbrane Biopharma AB (in collaboration with STADA Arzneimittel AG) and Bioeq IP AG (in collaboration with Formycon AG), companies that have each disclosed development plans for a Lucentis biosimilar candidate.
 CHS-2020 may face competition from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the holder of rights to Eylea, the reference product of CHS-2020), as well as Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Santo Holding GmbH (in collaboration with Formycon AG), companies that have each disclosed development plans for an Eylea biosimilar candidate.
 We expect any products that we develop and commercialize directly or with partners to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Collaboration and License Agreements 
 License Agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited 
 In January 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (“Daiichi Sankyo”) for the development and commercialization of certain biosimilar products in certain territories (the “Daiichi Sankyo Agreement”). We granted to Daiichi Sankyo an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop, commercialize and use biosimilar versions of etanercept (Enbrel) and rituximab (Rituxan) for the treatment of human diseases and conditions in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Daiichi Sankyo had an option, exercisable only within a certain time period, to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize certain biosimilar products in China. Daiichi Sankyo also had an option, exercisable at any time during the term of the agreement, to obtain a license to manufacture licensed products to support development and commercialization of licensed products in the licensed territory, on a product-by-product basis. Under the Daiichi Sankyo Agreement, we received an upfront payment in cash of $10.0 million and $20.0 million in the form of an equity investment and multiple payments under the memoranda of understanding. 
 In May 2012, Daiichi Sankyo terminated its licensed rights, solely as to CHS-0214, our etanercept biosimilar candidate, in Taiwan and South Korea. In August 2012, Daiichi Sankyo declined its right to expand the territory to include China. In July 2014, Daiichi Sankyo terminated all of its licensed rights to a biosimilar rituximab product. In July 2017, Daiichi Sankyo announced its decision, which we accepted, to discontinue development of CHS-0214 in Japan and to conclude the parties’ global open-label safety extension study in rheumatoid arthritis. As a result, we regained the rights to develop and commercialize CHS-0214 in Japan. In August 2017, we entered into a letter of agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to terminate the Daiichi Sankyo Agreement, including any and all memoranda of understanding and other agreements executed between the parties relating to CHS-0214. 
 License Agreement with Baxalta Incorporated, Baxalta US Inc., and Baxalta GmbH 
 We entered into a license agreement in August 2013 and two subsequent amendments thereto with Baxalta Incorporated, Baxalta US Inc., and Baxalta GmbH, collectively Baxalta (then Baxter International, Inc., part of Shire plc (“Shire”), as of June 2016), to develop and commercialize an etanercept biosimilar molecule, CHS-0214, worldwide, excluding the U.S., Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, China and most of the Caribbean and South American nations (as amended, the “Baxalta Agreement”). On September 26, 2016, Shire issued a termination notice of the Baxalta Agreement, in its entirety as part of its strategic portfolio review after its acquisition of Baxalta. Under the Baxalta Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $30.0 million and were eligible to receive up to $335.3 million in contingent payments, of which we actually received $215.3 million. Upon the termination of the Baxalta Agreement, we regained from Shire all development and commercial rights previously licensed under the Baxalta Agreement.

Distribution Agreement with Orox Pharmaceuticals B.V. 
 In December 2012, we entered into a distribution agreement with Orox Pharmaceuticals B.V. (“Orox”), for the commercialization of biosimilar versions of etanercept (Enbrel), rituximab (Rituxan), adalimumab (Humira) and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta). Under this agreement, we granted to Orox an exclusive license to commercialize the products for the treatment of human diseases and conditions in certain Caribbean and Latin American countries. Under this agreement, Orox has an option, exercisable within a defined time period, to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize certain additional biosimilar products in the same field and territory. We are obligated to manufacture and supply licensed products to Orox. 
 We are obligated to develop licensed products and achieve regulatory approval for such products outside of the Caribbean and Latin American countries covered by the agreement by specified dates in order to support Orox’s activities under the agreement in its licensed territory. We are eligible to receive from Orox a share of gross profits in the low 20 percent range from the sale of licensed products, on a product-by-product basis. 
 Our agreement with Orox will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis ten years after regulatory approval of such product in such country, subject to automatic three-year extensions unless Orox notifies us in writing at least 18 months in advance of the date upon which the term would otherwise expire that it does not wish to extend the term for such product in such country. Either party may terminate the agreement for material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified time period. Orox may terminate the Agreement for convenience on a product-by-product basis at any time upon 12-months prior written notice. Each party may terminate the agreement upon bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, and we may terminate the agreement immediately upon written notice to Orox if Orox challenges the licensed patents or commits a breach of specified provisions of the agreement. 
 License Agreements with Selexis SA 
 In April 2011 and June 2012, we entered into license agreements with Selexis SA (“Selexis”), under which Selexis granted to us royalty-bearing, non-exclusive, sublicensable licenses under Selexis’s intellectual property rights to manufacture, use and commercialize two of our biosimilar products using Selexis cell lines. In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreements, we made cash upfront payments to Selexis and are required to make payments based upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones for such biosimilar products, totaling up to €210,000 for each of the two products, or a total aggregate amount of €420,000. In addition, we are also required to pay a royalty as a percentage of revenue on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis in the low-single digits. 
 We may terminate each agreement at any time upon sixty days written notice to Selexis. Either we or Selexis may terminate an agreement for any material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified time period or in the event of the other party’s insolvency. Absent earlier termination, the agreements with Selexis terminate on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the expiration of the last-to-expire or lapse of the valid patent claims covering such product in such country. 
 Settlement and License Agreements with AbbVie, Inc.
 On January 24, 2019, we entered into three settlement and license agreements with AbbVie, that grant Coherus global, royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license rights under AbbVie’s intellectual property to commercialize CHS-1420, our proposed adalimumab (Humira) biosimilar. The global settlements resolve all pending disputes between the parties related to our adalimumab biosimilar. Under the U.S. settlement, our license period in the U.S. commences on December 15, 2023. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Additionally, our commercial success may depend on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our technologies where applicable and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies by, among other methods, filing U.S. and international patent applications on these technologies, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the U.S., a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. 
 18


In the normal course of business, we pursue patent protection for inventions related to our product candidates. We own a patent portfolio of 22 patent families related to our biosimilar product candidates, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents, and some include foreign counterparts to certain of the U.S. patents and patent applications. Our patent portfolio includes issued or pending claims directed to: formulations for CHS-1420 and CHS-0214; methods of manufacturing biological proteins, including CHS-1420 and CHS-0214; and drug products and devices, including their methods of use and methods of manufacture. 
 In a merger completed February 12, 2014, we acquired InteKrin Therapeutics Inc. (“InteKrin”) and its small molecule PPAR-g modulator, CHS-131, which is being developed for the treatment of NASH. 
 InteKrin has an exclusive license from Amgen to a portfolio of four patent families related to CHS-131, each of which includes U.S. patents, that we own applications and/or issued patents, and some include foreign counterparts to certain of the U.S. patents and patent applications. The licensed patent portfolio includes issued or pending claims directed to PPAR-g modulating molecules and therapeutic product compositions that are expected to expire in 2020 and 2021, as well as certain salt forms and polymorphic forms directed to PPAR-g modulating molecules that are expected to expire in 2024. Additionally, we and our subsidiary InteKrin own a portfolio of ten patent families related to CHS-131, each of which includes U.S. patent applications and/or issued patents, and some include foreign counterparts to certain of the U.S. patents and patent applications. This patent portfolio includes issued or pending claims directed to PPAR-g agonist pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of treating disorders including diabetes, multiple sclerosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or lipodystrophy, blood cancers, bone disorders, Huntington’s disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy.
 Upon the first FDA approval for a CHS-131 product, we intend to seek Hatch-Waxman patent term extension of CHS-131 related patents, that we own or license. Any such extension cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the extension period, must not exceed fourteen years following FDA approval.

 Regulatory 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities at the federal, state and local level in the U.S. and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
FDA Approval Process 
 All of our current product candidates are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA as biological products (“biologics”), except for CHS-131, which is regulated as a drug product candidate. The FDA subjects drugs and biologics to extensive pre- and post-market regulation pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) and its implementing regulations, and in the case of biologics, the FFDCA and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and their implementing regulations. In addition, we are subject to other federal and state statutes and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of drugs and biologics. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending BLAs or NDAs, withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a new biologic or drug may be marketed in the U.S. is long, expensive and inherently uncertain. Biologic and drug development in the U.S. typically involves the completion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests in accordance with good laboratory practices (“GLP”), the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, the performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the biologic or drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought in compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements, the submission to the FDA of an original BLA under Section 351(a) of the PHSA (“original BLA”) or an NDA, as appropriate, satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug or biologic is produced, and FDA approval and review of the original BLA or NDA. Developing the data to satisfy FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
 19


Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug or biologic to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies, although the IND must also include the results of preclinical testing and animal testing assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology and PD characteristics of the product along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 An IND must become effective before U.S. clinical trials may begin. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If during the 30-day waiting period the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies, the sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients with the condition under investigation, all under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP requirements, which are designed to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 Human clinical trials for novel drugs and biologics, such as our product candidate CHS-131, are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1—The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some therapeutic candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of such “Phase 4” clinical trials.
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”), for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 20


Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the product candidate. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. Additionally, for both NDA and BLA products, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life.
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information regarding the investigational product is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA or NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) as amended, each original BLA or NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews an original BLA or NDA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any original BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. In this event, the original BLA or NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the original BLA or NDA. The FDA reviews the original BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and in the case of an NDA, whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use, and in each case, whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the original BLA or NDA must submit a proposed REMS plan. The FDA will not approve an original BLA or NDA without a REMS plan, if required.  In determining whether a REMS plan is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug or biologic, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug or biologic, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug or biologic is a new molecular entity. A REMS plan may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug or biologic, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug or biologic. In addition, the REMS plan must include a timetable to assess the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval.
 The FDA will not approve the application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an original BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. After the FDA evaluates an original BLA or NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or trials, and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical trials or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the original BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 21


Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar under 351(k) 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), amended the PHSA and created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to a FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing and thereby lower development costs and increase patient access to affordable treatments. Thus, under the biosimilar approval pathway, an application for licensure of a biosimilar product pursuant to a Section 351(k) BLA must include information demonstrating biosimilarity based upon the following, unless the FDA determines otherwise: 

• | analytical studies demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the approved product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | two clinical study phases: first, a clinical study or studies (generally termed “Phase 1”) that demonstrate the PK and PD similarity (e.g., bioequivalence study) of the proposed biosimilar to the originator molecule, and second, a clinical study or studies (generally termed “Phase 3”) that demonstrate the safety (including immunogenicity), purity and that potency is statistically not inferior to that of the originator in one or more conditions for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, an application submitted under the 351(k) pathway must include information demonstrating that: 
  
• | the proposed biosimilar product and reference product utilize the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the proposed biosimilar product are the same as those for the reference product; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure and potent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Biosimilarity is defined to mean that the proposed biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. In addition, biosimilar may also be determined to be “interchangeable” with the reference products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that: 
  
• | the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | the proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the U.S. However, complexities associated with the large and intricate structures of biological products and the process by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to the FDA’s implementation of the 351(k) approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. For example, the FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence — laboratory, preclinical and/or clinical — required to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product. The FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence, provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, and recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. Biosimilar product 
 22


applications thus may not be required to duplicate the entirety of preclinical and clinical testing used to establish the underlying safety and effectiveness of the reference product. However, the FDA may refuse to approve a biosimilar application if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same or to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in active ingredients do not affect the safety, purity or potency of the biosimilar product. In addition, as with original BLAs, biosimilar product applications will not be approved unless the product is manufactured in facilities designed to assure and preserve the biological product’s safety, purity and potency. 
 The submission of an application via the 351(k) pathway does not guarantee that the FDA will accept the application for filing and review, as the FDA may refuse to accept applications that it finds are incomplete. The FDA will treat a biosimilar application or supplement as incomplete if, among other reasons, any applicable user fees assessed under the Biosimilar User Fee Amendment of 2017 have not been paid. In addition, the FDA may accept an application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical or clinical studies to demonstrate such biosimilarity under Section 351(k) or submit an original BLA for licensure as a new biological product under section 351(a) of the PHSA. 
 The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the branded product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for 12 years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application under the 351(k) pathway for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent and thus block Section 351(k) BLA applications from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension. 
 The first biological product determined to be interchangeable with a branded product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. This exclusivity period extends until the earlier of: (1) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (2) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement suit instituted under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (3) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit instituted under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing; or (4) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6). 
 Advertising and Promotion 
 Once an NDA, original BLA, or 351(k) BLA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing post-approval regulatory requirements, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in significant penalties, including the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA and federal and state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 
 Biologics and drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. After approval, most changes to the approved product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new marketing application or supplement to the approved marketing application before the change can be implemented. A supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing original application. There are also continuing annual program user fee requirements for marketed products. 
 Adverse Event Reporting and GMP Compliance 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of a marketing application. The FDA also may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 testing, a REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Manufacturers 
 23


and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, request product recalls or impose marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removals if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 We are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and transparency laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal statute governing healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers. 
 Additionally, federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
 The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance with such beneficiary inducement provision of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law can result in civil money penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.

Federal and state government price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs. Such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on marketed products. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements subject manufacturers to potentially significant discounts on products, increased infrastructure costs, and potentially limit the ability to offer certain marketplace discounts.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The PPACA, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.105 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Some states require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers and institutions as well as marketing expenditures and pricing information.
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 International Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In Europe, the approval of a biosimilar for marketing is based on an opinion issued by the EMA and a decision issued by the European Commission. However, substitution of a biosimilar for the originator is a decision that is made at the local (national) level on a country-by-country basis. Additionally, a number of European countries do not permit the automatic substitution of biosimilars for the originator product. Other regions, including Canada, Japan and Korea, also have their own legislation outlining a regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In some cases, other countries have either adopted European guidance (Singapore and Malaysia) or are following guidance issued by the World Health Organization (Cuba and Brazil). While there is overlap in the regulatory requirements across regions, there are also still some areas of non-overlap. 
 We are also subject to privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we are established or in which we sell or market our products or run clinical trials. For example, in Europe we are subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR) in relation to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e., data relating to an identifiable living individual). 
 25


We process personal data in relation to participants in our clinical trials in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), including the health and medical information of these participants. The GDPR is directly applicable in each E.U. Member State, however, it provides that E.U. Member States may introduce further conditions, including limitations which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data (including health and medical information), or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of personal data; defines for the first time pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data; introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are also subject to E.U. rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the E.U. and EEA. Where we transfer personal data out of the E.U. or EEA, we do so in compliance with the relevant E.U. data export requirements from time to time. We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those E.U. jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to the GDPR. Fines for certain breaches of the GDPR are significant: up to the greater of EUR 20 million or 4% of total global annual turnover. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease and desist certain activities, changes in the use of our data, enforcement notices, as well as potential civil claims including class action type litigation where individuals suffer harm.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 In the U.S. and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) adopted, effective January 1, 2018, a Medicare Part B rule on biosimilar payment and coding, which requires that each biosimilar to the same reference product be issued a unique Q-code for Medicare reimbursement purposes and that the payment amount for a billing code that describes a biosimilar is based on the average sales price (“ASP”) specific to each biosimilar.
 Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, then President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the U.S., and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act subjects biologic products to potential competition by lower‑cost biosimilars; increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; imposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; and addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. For example, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the entire Affordable Care Act is invalid based primarily on the fact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act, on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. While the Texas District Court Judge, as well as the current presidential administration and CMS, have stated that this ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the law. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. 
 26


Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
