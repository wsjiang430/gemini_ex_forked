Item 1.  Business
GENERAL DISCUSSION
 
Frequency Electronics, Inc. (sometimes referred to as “Registrant”, “Frequency Electronics” or the “Company”) is a world leader in precision time and frequency generation technology, which is employed in commercial and Government Satellite Payload systems, Secure Communications, Command, Control, Communication, Computer, Intelligence, Security and Reconnaissance (“C4ISR”), and Electronic Warfare (“EW”) systems.  Its technology is used for a wide range of space and non-space applications.
 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the Registrant or the Company are to Frequency Electronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  References to “FEI” are to the parent company alone and do not refer to any of the subsidiaries.  Frequency Electronics, a Delaware corporation, has its principal executive office at 55 Charles Lindbergh Boulevard, Mitchel Field, New York 11553.  Its telephone number is 516-794-4500 and its website is www.frequencyelectronics.com.
 
Frequency Electronics was founded in 1961 as a research and development firm generating proprietary precision time and frequency technology primarily under contracts for end-use by the United States (“U.S.”) Government.  In the mid-1990’s, the Company evolved into a designer, developer and manufacturer of state-of-the-art products for both commercial and government end-use.  The Company’s present mission is to be the world leader in providing precision time and low phase noise frequency generation systems, from 1 Hz to 46 GHz for space and other challenging environments.  The Company’s technology is the key element in enhancing the functionality and performance of many electronic systems.
 
MARKETS
 
The Company’s dominant end markets are satellite payloads and precision time for terrestrial secure communications and command and control.
 
For the satellite market, the Company has a unique legacy of providing master timing systems, power converters, and frequency generation, synthesis and distribution systems.  It is currently addressing new opportunities for next-generation atomic clocks and low G-sensitive oscillators for both space and terrestrial applications representing a potential for a significant increase in revenue for FEI products.  These products are applicable for both commercial and U.S. Government end-use.  Currently, approximately one thousand satellites with varying remaining useful life are operating in High/Geostationary, Medium and Low Earth Orbits.  The number of operational satellites with emphasis on high-throughput is expected to continue to grow over the next ten years as new satellites are added and older ones are replaced.  Furthermore, the U.S. Government is expected to issue a contract for additional satellites for the GPS III Follow-on program, and the Company is well positioned to compete for the onboard clock ensemble with its high-precision digital atomic frequency standard.
 
For the terrestrial secure communications and command and control market, the Company’s products support multiple C4ISR counter measures and EW applications for the U.S. Government on land, sea and air-borne platforms.  Recently identified threats to the communication capabilities of U.S. Government facilities through jamming, multi-path or “spoofing” global positioning systems (“GPS”) signals may be mitigated by the Company’s technologies.  In addition, similar types of threats to the public and enterprise networks have been identified by the Department of Homeland Security.  The Company’s high precision, ruggedized clocks combined with specialized software are essential for certain secure communication systems.
 
To address these markets, the Company has several corporate entities which operate under two reportable segments primarily based on the geographic locations of its subsidiaries. The two reportable segments are (1) FEI-NY, which includes the subsidiaries FEI Government Systems, Inc., FEI Communications, Inc., Frequency Electronics, Inc. Asia (“FEI-Asia”), being classified as an Asset Held for Sale, (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”) for details) and FEI-Elcom Tech, Inc. (“FEI-Elcom”) and (2) FEI-Zyfer, Inc. (“FEI-Zyfer”).
 
Frequency Electronics has made a strategic decision to focus on satellite payloads, C4ISR and EW market segments, because these business areas represent significant opportunities for revenue growth.  Accordingly, the Company has divested its Gillam-FEI s.a. (“Gillam”) Belgium subsidiary, and has classified FEI-Asia as an Asset Held for Sale.

On April 26, 2018, the Company sold Gillam to a European entity, in a stock purchase agreement, for $1 million in cash and a note receivable payable in three years for $1 million. The loss recorded due to the sale of Gillam was approximately $359,000.  For additional details see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
1.     FEI-NY – U.S. Government and commercial satellite electronics, as well as products for the U.S. military and commercial telecom customers, are designed and manufactured at the Company’s Long Island, New York headquarters facility. 
 
FEI-Asia was established in fiscal year 2002 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to be the Company’s Asia-based low-cost manufacturer of certain commercial communication products used primarily in the wireless and wireline markets as well as power grids.  FEI-Asia is located in the Free-Trade Zone in Tianjin, China.
 
FEI-Elcom designs and manufactures Radio Frequency (“RF”) microwave modules, devices and subsystems up to 46 GHz including fast switching, ultra-low phase noise synthesizers, up-down converters, receivers, tuners, ceramic resonance oscillators and dielectric resonance oscillators.  These instruments and components are mission critical for multiple applications in the EW market, SATCOM communication, surveillance, signal intelligence (COMINT, MASINT and ELINT), threat simulation, electronic attack (“EA”) and electronic prevention (“EP”) systems.  FEI-Elcom’s RF microwave technology has also been utilized to develop new products for application in the Company’s satellite payload end market. The Company has consolidated FEI-Elcom’s manufacturing capabilities with other FEI-NY operations in an effort to reduce costs and improve margin. 
 
2.     FEI-Zyfer - Precision time references for terrestrial secure communications and command and control, and frequency products that incorporate GPS technology are manufactured by the Company’s subsidiary, FEI-Zyfer.  FEI-Zyfer’s GPS capability complements the Company’s existing technologies and permits the combined entities to provide a broader range of embedded systems for a variety of timing functions and anti-spoofing (“SAASM”) applications. 
 
For additional information about these reportable segments, see Item 1. Business – Reportable Segments and Products.
 
In addition to its subsidiaries, the Company made a strategic investment in and licensed certain technology to Morion, Inc. (“Morion”), a Russian crystal oscillator manufacturer located in St. Petersburg, Russia.  The Company’s relationship with Morion, which includes ownership of 4.6% of the outstanding shares of Morion’s common stock, permits the Company to secure a cost-effective source for high precision quartz resonators and crystal oscillators.  The Morion investment is accounted for under the cost method.  For more information regarding the Company’s investment in Morion, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND PRODUCTS
 
The Company operates under two reportable segments, primarily aligned with the geographical locations of its subsidiaries: (1) FEI-NY and (2) FEI-Zyfer.  Within each segment the Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets precision time and frequency control products for different markets as described below.  The Company’s Chief Executive Officer measures segment performance based on total revenues and profits generated by each geographic center rather than on the specific types of customers or end-users.  Consequently, the Company determined that the segments indicated above appropriately reflect the way the Company’s management views the business.  The FEI-NY segment, which operates out of the Company’s Long Island, New York headquarters facility, also includes the operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, FEI-Asia and FEI-Elcom.  FEI-Asia functions as a manufacturing facility for FEI-NY and FEI-Zyfer with historically minimal sales to outside customers.  FEI-Elcom, in addition to its own product line, provides design and technical support for the FEI-NY segment’s business.  The products manufactured by the FEI-NY segment are principally marketed to the commercial and U.S. Government satellite markets, to other U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) customers and to wireless communications network providers.  The FEI-Zyfer segment, which operates out of California, designs and manufactures products which incorporate GPS technologies and high-precision clocks designed and manufactured at FEI-NY.  FEI-Zyfer sells its products to both commercial and U.S. Government customers and collaborates with FEI-NY on joint product development activities.
 
During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, approximately 77% and 68%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated revenues were from products sold by the FEI-NY segment.  In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, sales for the FEI-Zyfer segment were 25% and 39% of consolidated revenues, respectively.  (The sum of annual sales percentages exceeds 100% due to intersegment sales.)
 
Consolidated revenues include sales to end-users in countries located outside of the U.S., primarily in Europe and China.  During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, foreign sales comprised 3% and 6%, respectively, of consolidated revenues.  For segment information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FEI-NY segment:
 
The Company provides precision time, frequency generation and synchronization products and subsystems that are found on-board satellites, in ground-based communication systems and imbedded in mobile platforms operated by the U.S. military.  The Company has made a substantial investment in research and development (“R&D”) to apply its core technologies to satellite payloads, non-space DOD programs and commercial and industrial markets.  Revenues from satellite payloads, both for commercial and U.S. Government applications, have become the Company’s largest business area while the portion of network infrastructure sales has declined relatively.  The Company expects to continue to generate substantial revenues from deployment of new and replacement satellites and other U.S. Government/DOD applications including sales of ruggedized subsystems for moving platforms of the U.S. military.
 
Satellite Payloads
 
The use of satellites launched for communications, navigation, weather forecasting, video and data transmissions and Internet access has expanded the need to transmit increasing amounts of voice, video, and data to earth-based receivers.  This requires more precise timing and frequency control at the satellite.  The Company manufactures the master timing systems (quartz, rubidium) and other significant timing and frequency generation products for communication satellites, and many of the Company’s other space assemblies are used onboard spacecraft for command, control and power distribution.  Efficient and reliable DC-DC power converters are also manufactured for the Company’s own assemblies and as stand-alone products for space applications.  The Company’s oven-controlled quartz crystal oscillators are cost-effective precision frequency sources suited for high-end performance required in satellite communications, airborne and terrestrial datalinks and geophysical survey positioning systems.  Newly developed and upgraded frequency generators, synthesizers, and up/down converters and receivers have augmented the Company’s product offerings and positioned the Company to provide a greater share of a typical satellite’s payload.  Commercial satellite programs which utilize the Company’s space-qualified products include Iridium NEXT Constellation, Intelsat EPIC, O3B, WAAS, MexSat, MSV, ICO, TerreStar, EchoStar, Inmarsat and others.  The Company is also positioned to potentially provide products for planned satellite constellations that will operate in low- or mid-earth orbits.
 
In the years ahead, the Company expects that the DOD will require more secure communication capabilities, more assets in space and greater bandwidth.  The Global Positioning Satellite System, the MILSTAR Satellite System and the AEHF Satellite System are examples of the programs in which the Company has participated or will participate - programs which management believes are important to the success of the U.S. Government’s communication, intelligence and Precision Navigation and Timing (PNT) needs.  The Company previously manufactured the master clock for the Trident missile, the basic timing system for the Voyager I and Voyager II deep space exploratory missions and the quartz timing system for the Space Shuttle.  The Company’s product offerings for U.S. Government satellite programs are similar in design and function to those used on commercial satellites, as described above. The Company is developing an advanced technology optically pumped rubidium atomic clock intended for a variety of government programs requiring higher precision timing, which it believes will become the next generation of space and terrestrial atomic clocks.
 
U.S. Government- Non-space:
 
In addition to space-based programs, the Company’s proprietary products have been used in airborne and ground-based guidance, navigation, communications, radar, sonar and electronic countermeasures and timing systems.  The Company has developed and patented a low g-sensitivity (gravity) technology which offers a 100 times improvement in performance under shock, vibration and other environmental effects.  Products are built in accordance with DOD standards and are in use on many of the U.S. Government’s important military applications.  The Company anticipates that adequate funds will be provided by the U.S. Government to ensure that these programs are sustained.
 
FEI-Elcom addresses RF microwave modules and subsystems up to 46 GHz including fast switching, ultra-low phase noise synthesizers, up-down converters, receivers, tuners, ceramic resonance oscillators and dielectric resonance oscillators.  These instruments and components are mission critical for many applications in the EW market, including SATCOM communication, surveillance, intelligence collection (SIGINT, COMINT, MASINT, and ELINT), threat simulation, EA and EP systems.
 
The Company’s sales on U.S. Government programs for both space and non-space applications are generally made under fixed price or cost-plus contracts either directly with U.S. Government agencies or indirectly through subcontracts intended for government end-use.  For fixed-price contracts, the price paid to the Company is not subject to adjustment by reason of costs incurred by the Company in the performance of the contract, except for costs incurred due to contract changes ordered by the customer.  These contracts are negotiated on terms under which the Company bears the risk of cost overruns and derives the benefit from cost savings. Cost-plus contracts reimburse the Company for the actual costs incurred in performance of the contract requirements.

As indicated above, many of the programs and platforms for which the Company supplies products and systems, are used by the U.S. Government for maintaining secure communications world-wide, for obtaining vital intelligence and for enabling precision targeting capabilities.  It is the belief of management that the future success of the mission of the U.S. military and intelligence community is dependent on successful and timely deployment of these systems.  Thus, the Company anticipates that adequate funds will be provided by the U.S. Government to ensure that the programs are completed.  However, the Company’s experience indicates that programs and/or product sales can be delayed due to periodic U.S. Government appropriations cycles.
 
Negotiations on U.S. Government contracts are sometimes based in part on Certificates of Current Costs.  An inaccuracy in such certificates may entitle the government to an appropriate recovery.  The Company’s accounts with respect to these contracts are subject to audit by the Defense Contracts Audit Agency (“DCAA”). Frequency’s last full incurred cost audit was performed in 2008.  The Company is required to submit for subsequent review an incurred cost report by October 31, for each year then ended.  All such required reports have been filed with no adverse comment to date.
 
FEI has a DCAA audited and approved accounting system, which enables the company to enter into contracts directly with U.S. Government agencies that require government certified accounting systems.
 
Government end-use contracts are subject to termination by the purchaser for convenience or default, as well as various other Federal Acquisition Regulations (“FAR”) provisions.  In the event of a termination for convenience, the Company is entitled to receive compensation as provided under the specific terms of such contracts. There were no end-use contracts terminated for the year ended April 30, 2019.
 
FEI-Zyfer segment:
 
FEI-Zyfer designs, develops and manufactures products which provide Precision Navigation and Timing (PNT), primarily incorporating GNSS technology.  FEI-Zyfer’s products make use of both “in-the-clear” civil and “crypto-secured” military signals from GPS. FEI-Zyfer’s products are integrated into radar systems, airborne SIGINT/COMINT platforms, information networks, test equipment, military command and control terminals, and satellite ground stations.  FEI-Zyfer’s products are an important extension of FEI’s core product line, specifically in secure PNT for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR).  Recently identified threats to the communication capabilities of U.S. Government and to the public and enterprise networks through jamming, multi-path or “spoofing” GPS signals may be mitigated by FEI-Zyfer’s technologies and products.  High precision, ruggedized clocks combined with specialized software are essential for certain communication and operational security. More than 90% of FEI-Zyfer’s revenues are derived from sales where the end user is the U.S. Government.
 
BACKLOG
 
As of April 30, 2019, the Company’s consolidated backlog amounted to approximately $37 million compared to approximately $30 million at the end of the prior fiscal year.  Approximately 80% of the current backlog is expected to be filled during the Company’s fiscal year ending April 30, 2020. As of April 30, 2019, there are no amounts included in backlog under cost-plus fixed-fee (“CPFF”) contracts that have not been funded. The Company excludes from backlog those contracts or awards for which it has not received authorization to proceed.  On fixed price contracts, the Company excludes any unfunded portion.  The Company expects any partially funded contracts to become fully funded over time and will add the additional funding to its backlog at that time.  The backlog is subject to change for various reasons, including possible cancellation of orders, change orders, terms of the contracts and other factors beyond the Company’s control.  Accordingly, the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the revenues or profits (losses) which may be realized when the results of such contracts are reported.
CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS
 
The Company markets its products both directly and through independent sales representative organizations located in the U.S., Europe and Asia.  Sales to non-U.S. end-users totaled approximately 3% and 6% of net revenues in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
The Company’s products are sold to both commercial and governmental customers.  For the years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, approximately 87% and 74%, respectively, of the Company’s sales were made under contracts to the U.S. Government or subcontracts for U.S. Government end-use.

During fiscal year 2019, Lockheed Martin Corporation (“Lockheed Martin”) and BAE Systems, each accounted for more than 10% of FEI-NY segment revenues; additionally, Lockheed Martin accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues.  During fiscal year 2018, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Corporation (“Northrop Grumman”) and Thales Alenia Space each accounted for more than 10% of FEI-NY segment revenues; additionally, Lockheed Martin also accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. 
 
During fiscal year 2018, Raytheon Company (“Raytheon”) and Naval Supply Systems Command Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk Contracting Philadelphia Office (“NAVSUP”) each accounted for more than 10% of FEI-Zyfer segment revenues; additionally, Raytheon also accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. 
 
The loss by the Company of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.  The Company believes its relationship with these companies to be mutually satisfactory and is not aware of any prospect for the cancellation or significant reduction of any of its commercial or existing U.S. Government contracts.
 
The Company purchases a variety of components such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, connectors and diodes for use in the manufacture of its products.  The Company is not dependent upon any one supplier or source of supply for any of its component part purchases and maintains alternative sources of supply for all of its purchased components.  The Company has found its suppliers generally to be reliable and price-competitive.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
The Company’s technological leadership continues to be an essential factor to support future growth in revenues and earnings.  The Company has focused its internal R&D efforts on improving the core physics and electronic packages in its time and frequency products, conducting research to develop new time and frequency technologies and capabilities, improving product manufacturability by seeking to reduce its production costs through product redesign and process improvements and other measures to take advantage of lower cost components.
 
The Company continues to focus a significant portion of its own resources and efforts on developing hardware for satellite (commercial and U.S. Government) and terrestrial commercial communications systems, including wireless and GPS-related systems.  During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the Company expended $6.5 million and $7.0 million of its own funds, respectively, on such R&D activity.  See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Additionally, the Company receives customer funding for specific R&D projects and anticipates additional funding from customers for future R&D initiatives. During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, some of the Company’s development resources were applied to certain CPFF contracts and the design-stage of fixed-price satellite payload programs.  For fiscal year 2020, the resources to be allocated to R&D will depend on market conditions and identification of new opportunities, as was the case in fiscal 2019.
 
PATENTS AND LICENSES
 
The Company believes that its business is generally not dependent on patent or license protection.  Rather, it is primarily dependent upon the Company’s technical competence, the quality of its products and its prompt and responsible contract performance.  However, employees working for the Company assign all rights to inventions to the Company, and the Company presently holds such patents and licenses.  In certain limited circumstances, the U.S. Government may use or permit the use by the Company’s competitors of certain patents or licenses the government has funded.  During fiscal year 2003, the Company received a broad and significant patent for proprietary quartz oscillator technology which the Company has incorporated into its legacy designs, and which it will incorporate into future designs, to exploit in both legacy and new applications.  In 2006, the Company obtained a basic patent for its low g-sensitivity technology which management believes will permit greatly enhanced performance of devices on moving platforms and under externally imposed shock or vibration.
COMPETITION
 
The Company experiences competition in all areas of its business.  Many of the Company’s competitors are larger, have greater financial resources and have larger R&D and marketing staffs.  The Company has a strong history of competing successfully in this environment due to the quality, reliability and outstanding record of performance its products have achieved.  The Company competes primarily on the basis of the accuracy, performance and reliability of its products, the ability of its products to function under severe conditions, such as in space or in other extremely hostile environments, and the Company’s track record of prompt and responsive contract performance and technical competence.  The Company has unique and broad capabilities which include quartz, rubidium and cesium-based timing references and specialized RF microwave technology.  With respect to very high precision products, the Company encounters fewer competitors than it does for lower precision products for which there are a significant number of suppliers.
 
 7


The Company’s principal competition for space products is the in-house capability of its major customers such as Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin as well as a number of other firms capable of providing high-reliability microwave frequency generators.  With respect to non-space products, such as systems for precision time for terrestrial secure communication and command and control, and products for multiple applications in the EW market, the Company competes with larger domestic companies such as the previous Microsemi Corporation (now a part of Microchip Technology Inc.) and Mercury Systems.
 
The Company has previously outsourced certain manufacturing processes to third parties and to its wholly-owned subsidiary, FEI-Asia in Tianjin, China and to Russia-based Morion, in which the Company is a minority shareholder.  The Company believes its ability to obtain raw materials, manufacture finished products, integrate them into systems and sub-systems and interface these systems with highly sophisticated end-user applications provides a strong competitive edge.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
The Company employs approximately 280 full-time persons worldwide.  No employees are represented by labor unions.
 
OTHER ASPECTS
 
The Company’s business is not seasonal although it expects to experience some fluctuation in revenues during the second fiscal quarter as a result of summer holiday periods.  No unusual working capital requirements exist. Our U.S. Government contracts are subject to FARS, which impose various requirements and failure to comply could potentially have consequences.
