ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Introduction
 
We are a designer, producer, and marketer of performance-driven, high-quality ammunition and ammunition component products for sale to a variety of consumers, including sport and recreational shooters, hunters, individuals seeking home or personal protection, manufacturers and law enforcement and military agencies. To enhance the strength of our brands and drive product demand, we emphasize product innovation and technology to improve the performance, quality, and affordability of our products while providing support to our distribution channel and consumers. We seek to sell products at competitive prices that compete with high-end, custom, hand-loaded ammunition at competitive prices. Additionally, through our acquisition of Jagemann Stamping Company’s ammunition casing manufacturing and sales operations (“Jagemann Casings”) we are now able to sell ammunition casings products of various types. We emphasize an American heritage by using predominantly American-made components and raw materials in our products that are produced, inspected, and packaged at our facilities in Payson, Arizona and Manitowoc, Wisconsin.
 
Our production processes focus on safety, consistency, precision, and cleanliness. Each round is developed for a specific purpose with a focus on a proper mix of consistency, velocity, accuracy, and recoil. Each round is chamber gauged and inspected with redundant seven-step quality control processes.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Our goal is to enhance our position as a designer, producer, and marketer of ammunition products. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are as follows:
Design, Produce, and Market Innovative, Distinctive, Performance-Driven, High-Quality Ammunition and Ammunition Components
 
We are focused on designing, producing, and marketing innovative, distinctive, performance-driven, high-quality products that appeal to retailers, manufacturers, and consumers that will enhance our users’ shooting experiences. Our ongoing research and development activities; our safe, consistent, precision, and clean production processes; and our multi-faceted marketing programs are critical to our success.
Continue to Strengthen Relationships with Channel Partners and Retailers.
 
We continue to strive to strengthen our relationships with our current distributors, dealers, manufactures, and mass market and specialty retailers and to attract additional distributors, dealers, retailers, and manufacturers. The success of our efforts depends on the innovation, distinctive features, quality, and performance of our products; the attractiveness of our packaging; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising programs; and the effectiveness of our customer support.
Emphasis on Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty
 
We plan to continue to emphasize customer satisfaction and loyalty by offering innovative, distinctive, high-quality products on a timely and cost- attractive basis and by offering effective customer service, training, and support. We regard the features, quality, and performance of our products as the most important components of our customer satisfaction and loyalty efforts, but we also rely on customer service and support.
Continuously Improving Operations
 
We plan to continue focusing on improving all aspects of our business, including research and development, component sourcing, production processes, marketing programs, and customer support. We are continuing our efforts to enhance our production by increasing daily production quantities through equipment acquisitions, expanded shifts and process improvements, increased operational availability of our equipment, reduced equipment down times, and increased overall efficiency.

Enhance Market Share, Brand Recognition, and Customer Loyalty
 
We strive to enhance our market share, brand recognition, and customer loyalty. Industry sources estimate that 70 to 80 million people in the United States own more than approximately 300 million firearms, creating a large installed base for our ammunition products. We are focusing on the premium segment of the market through the quality, distinctiveness, and performance of our products; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising efforts; and the attractiveness of our competitive pricing strategies.
Pursue Synergetic Strategic Acquisitions and Relationships
 
We intend to pursue strategic acquisitions and develop strategic relationships designed to enable us to expand our technology and knowhow, expand our product offerings, strengthen and expand our supply chain, enhance our production process, expand our marketing and distribution, and attract new customers.
Products
 
We design, produce, and sell ammunition and ammunition components in a variety types, sizes, and calibers for use in handguns and long guns. We ship our ammunition in the form of cartridges (or rounds), and also ammunition casings. A cartridge consists of four components: a case made of brass, steel, or copper that holds together all the other components of the cartridge; the primer, which is an explosive chemical compound that ignites the gunpowder when struck by the firing pin; the gun powder, which is a chemical mixture that burns rapidly and creates an expanding gas when ignited and pushes the bullet out the barrel; and the bullet, or projectile, usually containing lead that is fired through the barrel to strike the target. Some of the bullets we produce for certain applications have a jacket, or outer shell, of brass or copper to improve performance and accuracy. We typically produce centerfire cartridges in which the primer is in the bottom, or center of the cartridge, rather than rimfire cartridges in which the primer is in the rim of the cartridge. Through our recent acquisition of Jagemann Casings we now offer ammunition casings for pistol ammunition through large rifle ammunition,
STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITIONTM
 
STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITIONTM enables shooters to see the path of the bullets fired by them. STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITIONTM rounds utilize non-flammable phosphor material that produces a glow by the utilization of the light emitted during the round discharge to make STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITIONTM glow. The luminescent material is applied only to the aft end of the projectile, making it visible only to the shooter and those within a 30-degree viewing window. As a result, the glow of STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITIONTM is not visible to the target unlike conventional tracers, which we believe is important to the military and law enforcement. Unlike conventional tracer ammunition, STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITIONTM rounds are not incendiary and do not utilize burning metals to generate light, thereby eliminating heat generation and making them safer for use in various environments and avoiding serious fire hazards. STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITIONTM comes in 380 auto, 9 mm, 40 S&W, 44 magnum, 45 long colt, and 38 special among other calibers.
 
We hold the exclusive worldwide sales and distribution rights for the patented technology used by our STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITIONTM and pay a royalty based on our product sales incorporating this technology.
 
OPS – One Precise Shot
 
OPS ammunition is designed to meet a wide variety of demanding engagement scenarios experienced by law enforcement personnel in the line of duty. The hollow point lead-free fragile bullet with hard outer casing and frangible copper core transfers 100% of its energy into the target. These bullets penetrate a variety of barriers, such as drywall, plywood, car doors, and auto glass. Upon entering soft tissue, the jacket and core separate with extensive force of impact, resulting in mass force trauma. The light weight projectile reduces recoil and enhances accuracy. OPS ammunition comes in 9 mm, 40 S&W, 45 auto calibers and a 223 rifle round.

-

Stealth Subsonic Ammunition
 
Stealth Subsonic ammunition is designed specifically for superior performance in suppressed firearms. Stealth ammunition finds applications in which silence is paramount, such as in tactical training, predator night hunts, and clandestine operations. The stealth ammunition is produced to be a clean burning total metal jacket round to slow baffle corrosion and reduce lead emissions that collect in the suppressor body. Stealth pistol ammunition comes in 9mm, 40 S&W, and 45 AC3. It is also available in a 223 rifle round.
Jesse James Ammunition
 
Jesse James ammunition is jacketed hollow point projectiles designed for self-defense. The load specific development is designed to ensure accuracy, velocity, and consistency and a low recoil. Jesse James ammunition comes in 9mm, 40 S&W, 10mm, 357, 45 auto calibers.
Jeff Rann’s American Hunter and Safari Services
 
Jeff Rann’s ammunition is intended for a complete range of game hunting. This high-end hunting ammunition has been designed by Jeff Rann, a well- known professional hunter and sports channel host and the owner of the well-known 777 Ranch in Texas and three ranches in Africa.
TAC-P™
 
Our Global Tactical Defense Division’s line of match grade hard armor piercing incendiary (HAPI) rounds, branded as TAC-P™ precision tactical munitions, are the centerpiece of the Company’s strategy to address the unique needs the armed forces community demands. This ammunition was designed around a match grade portfolio of projectiles, that include a solid copper boat tail and armor piercing configuration. The distinction between these rounds and other sold, is that the manufacturing process was engineered to ensure extremely tight tolerances between each projectile manufactured, ensuring for the end user that the ballistic trajectory remains consistent between rounds without regard to the actual configuration or round fired. Our TAC-P line is also available with our patented one-way luminescent or O.W.L. Technology™. Following AMMO’s acquisition of Jagemann Casings in March, the Company has aligned its manufacturing operations to support the large caliber demand from military personnel, such as the 12.7 mm and .50 caliber BMG configurations.
Ammunition Casings – Jagemann Munition Components
 
Through our recently acquired subsidiary, Jagemann Munition Components, we now offer ammunition casings for pistol ammunition through large rifle ammunition. Jagemann™ is backed by decades of manufacturing experience that allows the production of high-quality pistol brass and rifle brass components. Borne from the automotive industry and refined over time to deliver durable and consistent sporting components, Jagemann™ Casings, has become one of the largest brass manufacturers in the country, with the capacity to produce more than 300 million pieces of brass each year. Proud of its American-made components and capabilities, the Company now has complete control over the manufacturing process. This results in a number of advantages when it comes to the brass that leaves our state-of-the-art facility.
Marketing
 
We market our products to consumers through distributors, dealers, mass market and specialty retailers, and direct to consumer through e-commerce. We maintain consumer-focused product marketing and promotional campaigns, which include print and digital advertising campaigns; social and electronic media; product demonstrations; point-of-sales materials; in-store training, and in-store retail merchandising. Our use of social media includes Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and You Tube. We also utilize third-party endorsements, social influencers, and brand ambassadors, such as Jesse James and Jeff Rann.
Manufacturing
 
We conduct our ammunition research and development, manufacturing, assembly, inspection, and packaging operations in a 20,000 square foot facility located in Payson, Arizona. The facility currently can produce 36 million rounds of ammunition annually with the capacity to scale to 200 million rounds. Our in-house testing operation at the facility is intended to enhance the performance and reliability of our products.
 
Our ammunition casing research and development, manufacturing, and inspection operations take place in a 45,000 square foot facility located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. The facility can currently produce 300 million cases annually with ability to scale. Our inspection process is intended to enhance the performance and reliability of our products.
 
Research and Development
 
We conduct research and development activities to enhance existing products and develop new products at our facilities in Payson, Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona and Manitowoc, Wisconsin, utilizing our personnel and strategic relationships. We have recently expanded our research and development activity at our Scottsdale facility. We expense all costs associated with our research and development efforts through either our cost of goods sold, as they are performed by the same employees who produce our finished product, or through or general and administrative expenses if the product has not been brought to market.
Suppliers
 
We purchase certain of the raw materials and components for our ammunition products, including brass, steel, or copper casings; ammunition primers to ignite gun powder; gun powder; and projectiles. We believe we have reliable sources of supply for all our raw material and component needs, but from time to time raw materials and components are subject to shortages and price increases. Most of our suppliers are U.S.-based and provide us the materials and components at competitive rates. We recently secured our supply of ammunition casings through our acquisition of Jagemann Casings. We plan to broaden our supplier base and secure multiple sources for all the raw materials and components we require.

Customers
 
We sell our products through “Big Box” retailers, manufacturers, local ammunition stores, and shooting range operators. We also sell direct to customers online. Our consumers include sport and recreational shooters, hunters, competitive shooters, individuals desiring home and personal protection, manufacturers, and law enforcement and military agencies, and selected international markets. We distribute our products under five primary product lines: Jeff Rann, OPS, Stelth, STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™, and Jagemann Munition Components ammunition casings. Three customers accounted for approximately 54% of our sales for the year ended March 31, 2019, three customers account for 62% of our net sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, and one customer accounted for approximately 58% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. Quarter to quarter comparisons are not uniform, for example for the three month ended March 31, 2018, our largest customer for that period accounted for 35% of our total sales, and, for the year ended March 31, 2019, our largest customer for the period accounted for 25% of our respective total sales.
Competition
 
The ammunition and ammunition casing industry is dominated by a small number of companies, a number of which are divisions of large public companies. We compete primarily on the quality, reliability, features, performance, brand awareness, and price of our products. Our primary competitors include Federal Premium Ammunition, Remington Arms, the Winchester Ammunition division of Olin Corporation, and various smaller manufacturers and suppliers, including Black-Hills Ammunition, CBC Group, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady Manufacturing Company, PMC, Rio Ammunition, and Wolf.
Employees
 
As of June 28, 2019, we had a total of 93 employees, including 5 part-time employees. Of these employees, 71 were engaged in manufacturing, seven in sales and marketing, four in finance and accounting, three in research and development and eighty in various executive and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a union in collective bargaining with us. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Seasonality
 
Our business has not exhibited a material degree of seasonality to date. Our net sales could be moderately higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters because of the fall hunting and holiday seasons.
Intellectual Property
 
We believe our tradenames, trademarks, and service markets are important factors in distinguishing our products. In addition, we regard our trade secrets, technological resources, knowhow, licensing arrangements, and endorsements as important competitive factors.
 
Included in an acquisition for 600,000 shares of our Common Stock and $200,000 paid in cash to the former license holder, we acquired the exclusive license to produce ammunition using the patented “hybrid luminescence technology” owned by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. We use that technology in connection with our STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITIONTM.
 
We are a party to a license agreement with Jesse James, a well-known motorcycle designer, and Jesse James Firearms, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, or JJF. The licensing agreement grants us the exclusive worldwide rights through October 15, 2021 to Mr. James’ image rights and all trademarks associated with him in connection with the marketing, promotion, advertising, sale, and commercial exploitation of Jesse James Branded Products. In addition, Mr. James agreed to make himself available for certain promotional activities and to promote Jesse James Branded Products through his own social media outlets. We agreed to pay Mr. James royalty fees on the sale of ammunition and non-ammunition Branded Products and to reimburse him for any out-of- pocket expenses and reasonable travel expenses. We also issued 100,000 shares of our Common Stock upon the execution of the license agreement with the potential issuance of up to 75,000 additional shares of Common stock upon achieving certain gross sales with $15 million in gross sales required to earn the entire 75,000 shares.

We are a party to a license agreement with Jeff Rann, a well-known wild game hunter and spokesman for the firearm and ammunition industries. The license agreement grants for us through February 2022 the exclusive worldwide rights to Mr. Rann’s image rights and trademarks associated with him in connection with the marketing, promotion, advertising, sale, and commercial exploitation of all Jeff Rann Branded Products. Mr. Rann agreed to make himself available for certain promotional activities and to promote the Branded Products through his own social media outlets. We agreed to pay Mr. Rann royalty fees on the sale of ammunition and non-ammunition Branded Products and to reimburse him for any out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable travel expenses. We also issued 100,000 shares of our Common Stock upon the execution of the license agreement with the potential issuance of 75,000 additional shares of Common Stock upon achieving certain gross sales with $15 million in gross sales required to earn the entire 75,000 shares.
 
Through our acquisition of SW Kenectics, Inc., we acquired the rights to a patent for modular projectiles. This technology is used in connection with our TAC-P line of ammunition. The Company acquired SW Kenectics, Inc. for a total of up to $1,500,000 in cash and issue 1,700,002 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock. The agreement specifies that $1,250,000 of the cash is deferred pending completion of specific milestones and the 1,700,002 shares of common stock are subject to claw back provisions to ensure agreed upon objective are met.
 
Included in the acquisition of Jagemann Stamping Company’s casing division for $7,000,000 in cash, $10,400,000 delivered in the form of a Promissory Note, and 4,750,000 shares of our Common Stock, we acquired customer relationships, intellectual property, and the use of a tradename. These intangible assets are used in the operation and production of our ammunition casing business through our wholly owned subsidiary, Jagemann Munition Components.
 
Backlog
 
We did not have a material amount of backlog of orders as of March 31, 2019 or March 31, 2018. Backlog consists of orders for which purchase orders have been received and which are generally scheduled for shipment within three months. We generally allow orders that have not yet been shipped to be cancelled. Our backlog may not be indicative of future sales.
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing the discharge, treatment, storage, transportation, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes; the restoration of damages to the environment; and health and safety matters. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. We incur expenses in complying with environmental requirements and could incur higher costs in the future as a result of more stringent requirements that may be enacted in the future.
 
Some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal Superfund law and similar state laws, can impose liability, without regard to fault, for the entire cost of the cleanup of contaminated sites on current or former site owners and operators or parties who sent wastes to such sites. Based on currently available information, we do not believe that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
The manufacture, sale, and purchase of ammunition are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign governmental laws. We are also subject to the rules and regulations of the ATF and various state and international agencies that control the manufacture, export, import, distribution and sale of firearms, explosives, and ammunition. Such regulations may adversely affect demand for our products by imposing limitations that increase the costs or limit the availability of our products.
 
Our failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations may result in the limitation of our growth or business activities and could result in the revocation of licenses necessary for our business. Applicable laws and regulations provide for the following:
 

● | require the licensing of all persons manufacturing, exporting, importing, or selling ammunition or ammunition components as a business; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | require serialization, labeling, and tracking of the acquisition and disposition of certain types of ammunition; 
● | regulate the interstate sale of certain ammunition; 
● | restrict or prohibit the ownership, use, or sale of specified categories of ammunition;

-


● | require registries of so-called “ballistic images” of ammunition fired from new guns; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | govern the sale, export, and distribution of ammunition; 
● | regulate the use and storage of gun powder or other energetic materials; 
● | regulate the employment of personnel with certain criminal convictions; 
● | restrict access to ammunition manufacturing facilities for certain individuals from other countries or with criminal convictions; and 
● | require compliance with ITAR. 

 
The handling of our technical data and the international sale of our products may also be regulated by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. These agencies can impose civil and criminal penalties, including denying us from exporting our products, for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 
In addition, bills have been introduced in Congress to establish, and to consider the feasibility of establishing a nationwide database recording so-called “ballistic images” of ammunition fired from new guns. Should such a mandatory database be established, the cost to us, our distributors, and our customers could be significant, depending on the type of firearms and ballistic information included in the database. Bills have been introduced in Congress in the past several years that would affect the manufacture and sale of ammunition, including bills to regulate the manufacture, importation, and sale.
 
We believe that existing federal, state, and local legislation relating to the regulation of firearms and ammunition have not had a material adverse effect on our sales of these products. However, the regulation of firearms and ammunition may become more restrictive in the future, and any such developments might have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, regulatory proposals, even if never enacted, may affect firearms or ammunition sales as a result of consumer perceptions.
 
Our History
 
We were formed under the name Retrospettiva, Inc. in November 1990 to manufacture and import textile products, including both finished garments and fabrics, but ceased operations in 2001. We were inactive from 2001 until following a series of events starting in December 2016. On December 15, 2016, our then principal stockholders sold their outstanding Common Stock to Fred W. Wagenhals, who is our Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer, and largest stockholder. On the same date, Mr. Wagenhals became the sole officer and director of our company. As of December 30, 2016, we changed our trading symbol to POWW; we changed our state of incorporation from California to Delaware; we engaged in a 1-for-25 reverse stock split; and we commenced our current business as AMMO, Inc.
 
Our principal stockholder, Fred Wagenhals, had organized another company on October 13, 2016, which immediately began to take steps to commence the ammunition business. We combined with that company in March 2017, resulting in our acquisition of all the shares of its common stock for 17,285,800 shares of our Common Stock and our succession to its business.
 
We entered into licensing an endorsement agreement with Jesse James, a well-known motorcycle and gun designer, in October 2016, and a license and endorsement agreement with Jeff Rann, a well- known wild game hunter, guide, and spokesman for the firearm and ammunition industry, in February 2017; received a federal firearms license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Explosives in February 2017; purchased an ammunition manufacturing facility in Payson, Arizona in March 2017; and built a management team and otherwise prepared ourself to participate in the ammunition industry.
 
On September 28, 2017, AMMO Technologies Inc. (“ATI”), an Arizona corporation, which is 100% owned by us, merged with Hallam, Inc, a Texas corporation, with ATI being the survivor. Under the terms of the Merger, we, the sole shareholder of AMMO Technologies Inc., issued to Hallam, Inc.’s two shareholders, 600,000 shares of our common stock, subject to restrictions, and payment of $200,000. The first payment of $100,000 to the Hallam, Inc. shareholders was paid on September 13, 2017, and the second payment of $100,000 was paid on February 6, 2018.
 
During the summer of 2018, we also began conversations to acquire a small technology company named SW Kenetics Inc. SW Kenetics Inc. developed an innovative line of modular projectiles primarily geared toward tactical military operations. On July 6, 2018 we signed a letter of intent to purchase their company, as we believe their designs, coupled with our STREAK or O.W.L. Technology will position us to more aptly complete for military contracts. On September 27, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire SW Kenetics Inc. for a total of up to $1,500,000 in cash and issue 1,700,002 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock. The agreement specifies that $1,250,000 of the cash is deferred pending completion of specific milestones and the 1,700,002 shares of common stock are subject to claw back provisions to ensure agreed upon objectives are met. The acquisition was completed on October 5, 2018.
 
On March 15, 2019, Enlight Group II, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMMO, Inc., completed its acquisition of 100% of the assets of Jagemann Stamping Company’s ammunition casing, projectile manufacturing and sales operations pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement dated March 14, 2019. In accordance with the terms of the Amended APA, Enlight Group II, LLC paid Jagemann Stamping Company a combination of $7,000,000 in cash, $10,400,000 delivered in the form of a Promissory Note, and 4,750,000 shares of AMMO, Inc. Common Stock.
 
This acquisition was a critical element in the Company’s long-term strategy as it secures its supply chain for these important components and creates a more competitive pricing structure that it can leverage across all its targeted markets. This also greatly enhances the Company’s plant capacity and technical expertise required for the further development of military grade projectiles.
