ITEM 1.            BUSINESS
Overview
We are the global leader in the design, development, manufacture and distribution of performance‑driven golf products, which are widely recognized for their quality excellence. Our mission—to be the performance and quality leader in every golf product category in which we compete—has remained consistent since we entered the golf ball business in 1932. Today, we are the steward of two of the most revered brands in golf—Titleist, one of golf’s leading performance equipment brands, and FootJoy, one of golf’s leading performance wear brands. Titleist has been the #1 ball in professional golf for 70 years and FootJoy has been the #1 shoe on the PGA Tour for over six decades.
Our target market is dedicated golfers, who are the cornerstone of the worldwide golf industry. These dedicated golfers are avid and skill‑biased, prioritize performance and commit the time, effort and money to improve their game. We believe our focus on innovation and process excellence yields golf products that represent superior performance and consistent product quality, which are the key attributes sought after by dedicated golfers. Many of the game’s professional players, who represent the most dedicated golfers, prefer our products thereby validating our performance and quality promise, while also driving brand awareness. We seek to leverage a pyramid of influence product and promotion strategy, whereby our products are the most played by the best players, creating aspirational appeal for a broad range of golfers who want to emulate the performance of the game’s best players.
Dedicated golfers view premium golf shops, such as on‑course golf shops and golf specialty retailers, as preferred retail channels for golf products of superior performance and product quality. As a result, we have committed to being one of the preferred and trusted partners to premium golf shops worldwide. We believe this commitment provides us a retail environment where our product performance and quality advantage can most effectively be communicated to dedicated golfers. In addition, we also service other qualified retailers that sell golf products to consumers worldwide.
Our vision is to consistently be regarded by industry participants, from dedicated golfers to the golf shops that serve them, as the best golf company in the world. We have established leadership positions across all major golf equipment and golf wear categories under our globally recognized brands. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded net sales of $1,633.7 million, net income attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. of $99.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $230.8 million. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” Item 7 of Part II, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
Corporate History
Acushnet Company was originally founded as “Acushnet Process Company” in Acushnet, Massachusetts by Phil “Skipper” Young in 1910 and our golf business was established in 1932.  In 1976, Acushnet Company was acquired by American Brands, Inc. (the predecessor company of Beam Suntory, Inc. (“Beam”)). We acquired FootJoy in 1985. On July 29, 2011, Acushnet Holdings Corp. (at the time known as Alexandria Holdings Corp.), an entity owned by Fila Korea and certain financial investors, acquired Acushnet Company from Beam. We completed an initial public offering of our common stock in November 2016. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1-Description of Business,” Item 8 of Part II, included elsewhere in this report, for disclosures related to our initial public offering and other related transactions.
Our Core Focus
Dedicated Golfers
Our target market is dedicated golfers, who are avid and skill‑biased, prioritize performance and commit the time, effort and money to improve their game. We believe that dedicated golfers are generally the most consistent and voluminous purchasers of golf products as we believe they are the most discerning and most likely to invest in premium performance equipment and golf wear.

Product Platform
Leveraging the success of our golf ball and golf shoe businesses, while maintaining the core values of the Titleist and FootJoy brands, we have strategically entered into product categories such as golf clubs, wedges, putters, golf gloves, golf gear and golf wear with an objective of being the performance and quality leader.
Since the dedicated golfer views each performance product category on its own merits, we have approached each category on its own terms by committing the necessary resources to become a performance and quality leader in each product category where we participate. As a result, we have built an industry leading platform across all performance product categories, driving a market‑differentiating mix of consumable products, which we consider to be golf balls and golf gloves, which collectively represented 39% of our net sales in 2018, and more durable products, which we consider to be golf clubs, golf shoes, golf apparel and golf gear, which collectively represented 61% of our net sales in 2018.
We operate under the following four reportable segments: Titleist golf balls; Titleist golf clubs; Titleist golf gear; and FootJoy golf wear, which represented approximately 32%, 27%, 9% and 27%, respectively, of net sales in 2018. For further information surrounding the principal products of each reportable segment, see “Our Products” further below.  Financial information for our segments, including sales by geographic area, is included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” Item 7 of Part II, included elsewhere in this report and in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 21 – Segment Information,” Item 8 of Part II, included elsewhere in this report.
Pyramid of Influence
The game of golf is learned by observation and imitation, and golfers improve their own performance by attempting to emulate highly skilled golfers. Golfers are influenced not only by how other golfers swing but also with what they swing and at what they swing. This is the essence of golf’s pyramid of influence, which is deeply ingrained in the mindset of the dedicated golfer. At the top of the pyramid is the most dedicated golfer, who attempts to make a living playing the game professionally. Adoption by most of the best golfers, whose professional success depends on their performance, validates the quality, features and benefits of using the best performing products. This, in turn, creates aspirational appeal for golfers who want to emulate the performance of the best players. Our primary marketing strategy is for our products to be the most played by the best players, including both professional and amateur golfers. We believe this strategy has proven to be enduring and effective in the long‑term and is not dependent on the transient success of a few elite players at any given point in time.
Innovation Leadership
We believe innovation is critical to dedicated golfers as they depend on the ability of new and innovative products to drive improved performance. We currently employ an R&D team of approximately 190 scientists, chemists, engineers and technicians. We also introduce new product innovations at a cadence that best aligns with the typical dedicated golfer’s replacement cycle within each product category.
Operational Excellence
The requirements of the game lead the dedicated golfer to seek out products of maximum performance and consistency. We own or control the design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging and distribution of our products. In doing so, we are able to exercise control over every step of the manufacturing process and supply chain operations, thereby setting the standard for quality and consistency. We have developed and refined distinct and independently managed supply chains for each of our product categories.
Route to Market Leadership
As one of the preferred partners to premium golf shops, we seek to ensure that the performance benefits derived from using our products are showcased and our products are properly merchandised. As we see our retail partners as a critical connection to dedicated golfers, we place great emphasis on building strong relationships and trust with them. This is the reason our sales associates are expected not simply to be salespeople, but to function as golf experts and enthusiasts in their respective territories who advise and assist our retail partners to better serve their customers. We help generate golfer demand and sell‑through via in‑shop merchandising, promotions and advertising, and also provide product education to club professionals, coaches and instructors. Lastly, we place a strong focus on consumer engagement, starting with fitting and trial initiatives across our balls, clubs and shoes categories. We offer custom products across categories that we believe are better aligned with golfers’ personal styles, skill levels and preferences.

Market Overview and Opportunity
Market Overview
In 2018, there were over 50 million golfers worldwide playing over 800 million rounds annually on over 31,000 golf courses, and our addressable market, comprised of golf equipment, golf wear and golf gear, represented approximately $12 billion in retail sales and approximately $8 billion in wholesale sales. The United States accounted for over 40% of our addressable market, followed by Japan and Korea collectively accounting for over 30% of our addressable market, each in 2018. We believe the number of rounds of golf played by our target market of dedicated golfers has remained stable over the past few years. 
We view emerging economies, such as the markets in Southeast Asia, as attractive long‑term opportunities based on our assessment of the five collectively necessary and sufficient conditions for a country to embrace golf: (1) sizeable middle‑class population; (2) educational infrastructure; (3) places to play and practice; (4) professional success that inspires the local golfers; and (5) corporate support.
We believe the golf industry is mainly driven by golfer demographics, dedicated golfers, weather and economic conditions.
Golfer Demographics. Golf is a recreational activity that requires time and money. The golf industry has been principally driven by the age cohort of 30 and above, currently “gen‑x” (age 39 to 54) and “baby boomers” (age 55 to 73), who have the time and money to engage in the sport. Since a significant number of baby boomers have yet to retire, we anticipate growth in spending from this demographic, as it has been demonstrated that rounds of play increase significantly as those in this cohort reach retirement. Further, we also believe that the percentage of women golfers will continue to grow, as a higher percentage of new golfers in recent years has been women. Beyond the gen‑x and baby boomer generation, another promising development in golf has been the generational shift with millennial golfers making their marks at both professional and amateur levels and, in 2018, accounting for 26% of golfers overall in the U.S. 
Dedicated Golfers. Dedicated golfers are largely older millennials, gen‑x and baby boomers who have demonstrated the propensity to pay a premium for products that help them perform better. We believe dedicated golfers, who comprise our target market, will continue to be a key driver for the global golf industry.
Weather Conditions. Weather conditions determine the number of playable days in a year and thus influence the amount of time people spend on golf. Weather conditions in most parts of the world, including our primary geographic markets, generally restrict golf from being played year‑round, with many of our on‑course customers closed during the cold weather months. Therefore, favorable weather conditions generally result in more playable days in a given year and more golf rounds played, which generally results in increased demand for all golf products.
Economic Conditions. The state of the economy influences the amount of money people spend on golf. Golf equipment, including clubs, shoes, balls and accessories, is recreational in nature and is therefore a discretionary purchase for consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products when economic conditions are favorable and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous.
Our Growth Strategies
We plan to continue to pursue organic growth initiatives across all product categories, brands, geographies and marketing channels.
Introduce New Products and Extend Market Share Leadership in Equipment Categories. We expect to sustain our strong performance in our core categories of golf balls, golf clubs and golf shoes through several targeted strategies:

• | Titleist Golf Balls. We continually invest in design innovation and process technology to deliver the highest performance and quality golf balls in the game. We strive to strengthen our sell-in and sell-through route to market capabilities by focusing on enhancing our sales team's skills, supporting trade partners in those channels where dedicated golfers shop, and educating golfers on Titleist golf ball performance and quality excellence. We also offer custom imprinting for country clubs, tournaments, corporate logos and personalization. My Titleist, an online golf shop launched in early 2018, provides golfers with the opportunity to create and purchase their own golf balls with special play numbers, logos or personalization.

• | Titleist Clubs, Wedges and Putters. We intend to continue to launch innovative, high performance golf clubs by further leveraging Titleist clubs’ R&D platform. We believe concept and specialty products and premium quality digital content will further drive customer awareness and market share gains across all premium club categories. To enhance trial and fitting, we plan to continue our consumer connection initiatives, grow our fitting network in opportunistic markets and further promote the utilization of our distinctive fitting operations. We are also executing several initiatives to further elevate Vokey Design wedges and Scotty Cameron putters as golf’s leaders in short‑game performance, technology, craftsmanship and selection. 


• | FootJoy Footwear. We continue to invest in design and innovation to bring golf-specific performance advancements to the footwear category. With the launch of several new models in 2019, we plan to enrich our consumer connection initiatives with digital content, product trial and fit experiences in key global markets. Additionally, we have enhanced our MyJoys personalization platform, which supports millions of unique design combinations, to provide unique, personalized experiences for golfers around the world. 

Increase Penetration in Golf Gear and Wear Categories. We intend to build on the brand loyalty that the dedicated golfer has developed for our Titleist ball and club categories and FootJoy shoe, glove and apparel categories in order to increase our penetration in the adjacent categories of golf gear and golf wear. We expect to continue to drive growth across these categories by employing the following initiatives:

• | Titleist Golf Gear. We are committed to providing dedicated golfers with golf gear—including golf bags, headwear, gloves, travel gear, head covers and other accessories—of performance and quality excellence that is faithful to the Titleist brand promise. We are making significant investments in design and engineering resources and are leveraging dedicated player research methodologies and insights to drive innovation in this product category. We also plan to expand our custom and special edition product offerings and, in 2018, we launched direct to consumer sales of golf gear via our My Titleist online golf shop. 


• | FootJoy Apparel. We remain committed to bringing style, performance, and innovation to the golf apparel category. In addition to our seasonal apparel collections, we plan to launch new outerwear products to meet the performance expectations of the most demanding players and "make every day playable." We plan to continue to work with select players on the PGA and European PGA Tour who trust the FJ brand to perform at the highest levels. 


• | FootJoy eCommerce Launch. We launched eCommerce websites for FootJoy in the U.S. in 2016 and in Canada and certain European markets in 2017. We also launched an eCommerce website for FootJoy's luxury brand, FJ1857.com, in the U.S. in 2018. Over 7,000 SKUs are offered across all FootJoy categories, including shoes, gloves and apparel. The eCommerce initiative is expected to yield incremental sales and profitability, and enriched data on preferences and trends, as well as foster a deeper and more real time connection with dedicated golfers. 

Strategically Pursue Global Growth. The Titleist and FootJoy brands are both global brands. While we believe that a majority of the near‑term growth will be driven by the developed economies, emerging economies, such as the markets in Southeast Asia, represent longer‑term growth opportunities. To meet future demand, we are ensuring that local capabilities and expertise in sales, customer service, merchandising, online presence, golf education and fitting initiatives are in place to support our operations. We continue to hire local talent across all functions in order to better position Titleist and FootJoy products in those markets where participation and popularity of the sport are expected to increase.
Our Products
We design, manufacture and market a broad range of products under the Titleist and FootJoy brands. Both brands are recognized as industry leaders in performance, quality, innovation and design. Our products include golf balls, golf clubs, wedges and putters, golf shoes, golf gloves, golf gear and golf outerwear and apparel.

Titleist
We design, manufacture and sell golf balls, golf clubs, wedges and putters and golf gear under the Titleist brand. Net sales of Titleist products for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $1,194.0 million, $1,122.8 million, and $1,139.2 million, respectively, in each case approximately 73% of our total net sales.
Titleist Golf Balls
Titleist is the #1 ball in golf. The Titleist golf ball was founded with the purpose of designing and manufacturing a golf ball that was performance superior and quality superior to all other balls available in the market. We believe the golf ball is the most important piece of equipment in the game, as it is the only piece of equipment used by every player for each shot in the round. The golf ball category also generates the largest portion of our sales and profits. Since its introduction in 2000, the Titleist Pro V1 has been the best selling golf ball globally. Launched on the PGA Tour in October 2000 and introduced to the consumer market in December 2000, the first Pro V1 golf ball represented the coalescence of three of Titleist's industry leading technologies: large solid core; multi-component construction; and high performance, thermoset cast urethane elastomer covers. In its first four months, the Pro V1 golf ball became the best selling golf ball and holds that position to this day. In 2003, the first Pro V1x golf ball was brought to market and with its four-piece, dual core design, produced higher launch characteristics and a different spin profile than Pro V1. Both Pro V1 and Pro V1x are designed to provide total performance for golfers at every level of the game and best demonstrate Titleist's design, innovation and technology leadership.
In 2019, we introduced new versions of Pro V1 and Pro V1x, both designed to leave the clubface with more ball speed and lower long game spin for more distance, while providing the best short game control that helps golfers shoot lower scores. We believe that golfers will benefit from the improvements of more speed, precision and consistency, along with soft feel and long lasting durability. Complementing Pro V1 and Pro V1x is a new high performance golf ball in the Titleist product line, AVX. After a test market in U.S. sunbelt markets in the fall of 2017, Titleist introduced AVX globally in mid-2018 to resounding golfer acceptance. AVX delivers lower spin, lower flight and softer feel than our Pro V1 models and provides golfers with a premium performance alternative. 
We also provide best-in-class performance with the Tour Soft, Velocity and DT TruSoft models which were newly launched in 2018. Through technology and process innovations, these models meet different performance needs as well as preferences such as feel, color, play number and price. Tour Soft is designed to deliver better feel and better distance than the 
5

competitive set. Velocity is designed to maximize distance on every shot in the bag. DT TruSoft is Titleist's softest compression golf ball and provides excellent distance and greenside control. The Pinnacle brand completes the Acushnet golf ball portfolio with its two major models, Rush and Soft. Competing in the price segment, the Pinnacle brand allows the Titleist brand to focus on the premium performance and performance segments of the market. It also helps to support the thousands of golf shops that choose to exclusively stock Titleist and Pinnacle golf balls and offer golf balls in each market segment to their golfers.
Net sales of Titleist golf balls for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $524.0 million, $512.0 million, and $513.9 million, respectively, in each case approximately 32% of our total net sales.
We are also a leader in custom imprinted golf balls. This includes printing high quality reproductions of corporate logos, tournament logos, country club or resort logos, and personalization on Titleist and Pinnacle golf balls. Our service includes design capabilities, special packaging options and fast turnaround times. The majority of custom imprinting is done for corporate logos, as there has long been a strong connection between the business community and golf. Custom imprinted golf balls represented approximately 30% of our global net golf ball sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Titleist Golf Clubs, Wedges and Putters
We design, assemble and sell golf clubs (drivers, fairways, hybrids and irons) under the Titleist brand, wedges under the Vokey Design brand and putters under the Scotty Cameron brand. The mission of our golf club business is to design and develop the best performing golf clubs in the world for dedicated golfers. We believe dedicated golfers do not buy brands across categories but seek out best‑in‑class products in each category. This is the reason we have partnered with dedicated engineers and craftsmen such as Bob Vokey and Scotty Cameron, who understand the nuances, subtleties and impact mechanics of their respective golf club categories. Titleist golf clubs, Vokey Design wedges and Scotty Cameron putters are widely used by professional and competitive amateur players, which validates the products’ performance and quality excellence. We are also committed to a leading club fitting and trial platform to maximize dedicated golfers’ performance experience.
We view and operate the Titleist golf club business in three distinct categories: clubs (which includes drivers, fairways, hybrids and irons), wedges and putters. Our products are generally priced at or above the premium price points in the marketplace, driven by higher‑end technologies (including design, materials and processes) we employ to generate superior quality and performance. We have different models within each category to address the distinct performance needs of our dedicated golfer target audience. 
Net sales of Titleist golf clubs, wedges and putters for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $445.3 million, $398.0 million, and $431.0 million, respectively, in each case approximately 27% of our total net sales.
Titleist Clubs
Our current global club line consists of the TS product line of drivers and fairways, the 818 product line of hybrids and the 718 product line of irons. Every product in our club line features premium, tour‑proven stock shafts and grips, complemented by a broad range of custom options.
Titleist TS drivers and fairways are designed to deliver superior performance through tour‑proven technologies that increase ball speed, decrease spin, and optimize flight without sacrificing forgiveness. We design our drivers and fairways to deliver complete performance with tour‑preferred looks, sound and feel, and we offer the ability to precisely fit individual golfers’ needs.
Titleist 818 hybrids generate long game performance through advanced technology. The advanced features of our hybrids aim to facilitate precision fitting and generate high ball speed, low spin and high launch for increased distance and forgiveness.
Titleist 718 irons are innovative, technologically advanced products designed to deliver distance, forgiveness, proper shot control and feel. While we offer stock set configurations for our iron sets, a significant portion of our worldwide iron sales are custom fit to help deliver a better fit and performance.
Vokey Design Wedges
Bob Vokey champions the Titleist wedge effort by creating high performance wedges to meet the demands of dedicated golfers and the best players in the world. The Vokey Design wedge product offering is a compilation of the most popular wedges resulting from Bob Vokey’s hands‑on work with golf’s best players to develop shapes and soles that address varying techniques and course conditions. In total, we offer 23 unique loft, sole grind and bounce combinations and three unique finishes to create golf’s most complete wedge product performance range. In addition, Vokey’s online Wedgeworks 
6

program promotes limited edition models and allows golfers to customize and personalize their wedges. Vokey Design wedges are the most played wedges by tour professionals.
Scotty Cameron Putters
Scotty Cameron Fine Milled Putters are developed through a specialized and iterative process that blends art and science to create high performance putters. Scotty’s design inspiration begins with studying the best players in the world and working with them to identify the consistent strengths and attributes of their putting. Scotty Cameron encourages a selection process that identifies the putter length, toe flow and appearance to deliver proper balance, shaft flex and feel to golfers and to encourage proper technique. Scotty Cameron putters consist of a range of products for each of these key selection criteria.
Using the scottycameron.com website as an information and services hub, we offer the opportunity to connect more closely with the Scotty Cameron brand. Golfers can customize and personalize their putter(s) in the online Scotty Cameron Custom Shop. Through the popular “Club Cameron” loyalty program and Scotty’s online “Studio Store,” brand fans can purchase unique Scotty Cameron accessories. In 2014, we also opened the Scotty Cameron Gallery in Encinitas, California, and in 2016, we entered into a license agreement whereby a third party opened and operates a similar facility in Tokyo, Japan. Each of these facilities is a premium retail boutique which offers consumers the ability to experience the tour fitting process as well as purchase unique accessory items.
Titleist Golf Gear
We offer a diversified portfolio of Titleist‑branded performance golf gear. Our golf gear is focused on superior performance and quality excellence, which is the mission of any product bearing the Titleist brand name.
Titleist golf gear products are designed and engineered using premium materials, paying particular attention to superior performance, function and style. We focus on the design and development of golf bags, headwear, golf gloves, travel gear, head covers and other golf gear. We provide customization and/or personalization within each category of Titleist golf gear, as well as certain licensed products, in order to meet the needs of the dedicated golfer and as part of our service to our accounts. We believe the golf gear business represents a sizable but highly fragmented opportunity with numerous competitors in each product category and geographical market. 
Titleist golf gear accounted for net sales of $146.1 million, $142.9 million and $136.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in each case approximately 9% of our total net sales.
FootJoy Golf Wear
FootJoy is one of golf’s leading performance wear brands, which consists collectively of golf shoes, gloves and apparel. Net sales of FootJoy products for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $439.7 million, $437.5 million, and $433.1 million, respectively, in each case approximately 27% of our total net sales.
FootJoy Golf Shoes
FootJoy is the #1 shoe in golf and has been the #1 shoe on the PGA Tour for over six decades. With an exclusive focus on golf, FootJoy shoes are designed, developed and manufactured for all golfers in all golf shoe categories, including traditional, casual, athletic and spikeless.
The golf shoe category is one of the most demanding of all wearables, as golf shoes must perform in all weather conditions, including extreme temperature and moisture exposure; be resistant to pesticides and fungicides; withstand frequent usage and extensive rounds of play; and provide consistent comfort, support and protection to the golfer in an average of over five miles in a walked round. Hence, golf shoes require extensive knowledge and expertise in foot morphology, walking and swing biomechanics, material science and application and sophisticated manufacturing and construction techniques.
Golf shoes are also a style and fashion driven category. FootJoy offers a large assortment of styles to suit the needs and tastes of all golfers. The breadth and scope of the FootJoy product line is commensurate with its leading sales position. To maintain and grow this leadership position in the category, new product launches and new styles comprise approximately 50% of its offerings each year in all significant markets around the world.
In addition to its stock offerings, FootJoy is a leader in the customization of golf shoe styles and designs. FootJoy’s MyJoys custom golf shoe portal provides individual choices for style, color, personal IDs and team logos that are produced to order for golfers around the world. We believe it is the largest choice offering in the golf shoe category and provides a service and personal expression capability that creates brand loyalty and repeat purchases.

FootJoy Gloves
FootJoy is the #1 glove in golf. FootJoy is the leader in sales for all sub‑categories of the glove business, including leather construction, synthetic, leather/synthetic combinations and all specialty gloves, including rain and winter specific offerings.
FootJoy Outerwear and Apparel
FootJoy’s most recent brand extensions have been the entry into the golf outerwear and golf apparel markets. FootJoy’s goal for outerwear is to “make every day playable” and extend the golf season by providing products for rain, wind and cold conditions. FootJoy entered the outerwear category in 1996 with innovative designs and materials, became the leader in net sales in the United States by 2005 and still holds this position today.
FootJoy more broadly entered the U.S. women’s golf apparel market in early 2016 under the trademark GolfLeisure. The styling is appropriate for golf and inspired by the current athleisure segment of women’s apparel in other categories and uses.
Product Launch Cycles
We maintain differentiated and disciplined product launch cycles across our portfolio, which we believe has contributed to stable and resilient growth over the long‑run. This approach gives our R&D teams a period of time we believe is necessary to develop superior performing products versus prior generation models. As a result, we are able to manage our product transitions and inventory from one generation to the next more efficiently and effectively, both internally and with our trade partners.
Product introductions generally stimulate net sales as the golf retail channel takes on inventory of new products. Reorders of these new products then depend on the rate of sell‑through. Announcements of new products can often cause our customers to defer purchasing additional golf equipment until our new products are available. The varying product introduction cycles may cause our results of operations to fluctuate as each product line has different volumes, prices and margins.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations – Product Life Cycles,” Item 7 of Part II to this report, for further information surrounding our product launch cycles.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing processes and management of supply chain operations ensure consistency of product performance and quality. We own or control the design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging and distribution of our products.
Our manufacturing network is comprised of our owned facilities and partners around the globe. Our scale and global reach are intended to enable us to maximize cost efficiency, reduce lead time, provide regional customization and gain insights into local markets.
We have three company‑owned and operated golf ball manufacturing facilities, two located in the United States and one in Thailand, encompassing approximately 600,000 total square feet with sufficient production capacity to meet anticipated growth. We also have local custom golf ball imprinting operations in the United States, Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom (servicing the U.K., Ireland and continental Europe), Korea and China. We utilize local vendors for imprinting capabilities in other geographic markets.
We assemble clubs at six global locations, allowing us to provide custom fitted golf clubs with regional customization with efficient turnaround times. Each of our six custom manufacturing locations is responsible for supply chain execution for golf clubs and wedges, from forecast generation to component procurement to club assembly and distribution, allowing each region to respond to market specific needs or trends. Scotty Cameron putters are assembled solely at our Carlsbad, California manufacturing facility.
We own and operate the largest golf glove manufacturing operation in the world in Chonburi, Thailand, where we manufacture both FootJoy and Titleist golf gloves. The factory produces over 10 million FootJoy and Titleist gloves annually.
Nearly all of our FootJoy golf shoes are manufactured in a 525,000 square foot facility in Fuzhou, China, owned by a joint venture in which we have a 40% interest with the remaining 60% owned by our long‑standing Taiwan supply partners. In our consolidated financial statements, we consolidate the accounts of this joint venture, which is a variable interest entity, or VIE. The joint venture was established in 1995 and has been in its current facility since 2000. The sole purpose of the joint 
8

venture is to manufacture our golf shoes and as such we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE as defined by ASC 810. The multi‑floor/multi‑building complex owned by the joint venture is devoted exclusively to FootJoy golf shoes, has production capacity of nearly five million pairs per annum. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements– Note 2– Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Variable Interest Entities,” Item 8 of Part II included elsewhere in this report, for a discussion of our FootJoy golf shoe joint venture and the material terms of the agreement which governs such joint venture arrangement.
Sales and Distribution
Our accounts consist of premium golf shops, which include on‑course golf shops and golf specialty retailers, as well as other qualified retailers that sell golf products to consumers worldwide. We have a selective sales and distribution strategy, differentiated by product line and geography, which focuses on effectively serving those accounts that provide best access to our dedicated golfer target market in each geographic market.
We operate, and have our own field sales representation, in those countries that represent the substantial majority of golf equipment and wearable sales, including the United States, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Sweden, France, Greater China, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. In other countries in which we sell our products, we rely on select distributors in order to deepen our reach into those markets. Each country administers its own in‑country channel of distribution strategy given the unique characteristics of each market.
Our sales and distribution takes a “category management” approach that encompasses all aspects of customer service and fulfillment, including product selection; space and display planning; sales staff training; and inventory control and replenishment. Each sales representative advises on topics such as shop layout, merchandise display techniques and effective use of signage and product information and methods of improving inventory turns and sales conversions through merchandising. Our sales force has been recognized worldwide for its professionalism and service excellence.
We employ nearly 390 sales representatives worldwide, who are compensated through a combination of salary and a performance bonus. We currently service nearly 28,000 direct accounts worldwide. In both our direct sales and distributor markets, our trade partners are subject to our redistribution policy.
Supplementing our core field sales partnerships are Internet‑based initiatives. In the U.S. in 2016, we launched FootJoy and Titleist eCommerce websites. In Canada and certain European markets in 2017, we launched FootJoy eCommerce websites. In the U.S. in 2018, we launched an eCommerce website for FootJoy's luxury brand, FJ1857.com and, in the United Kingdom and Japanese markets, we launched eCommerce websites for Titleist golf balls.
Marketing
Throughout our history, we believe our commitment to marketing has helped further elevate our brands and strengthen our reputation for product performance and quality, with a particular focus on the perception of dedicated golfers. Our strategy is to deliver equipment that is superior in performance and quality, validated by the pyramid of influence. It is best‑in‑class performance and quality products that earn and maintain dedicated golfers’ loyalty and trust. Our marketing strategy, developed and refined over many years, is to reinforce this loyalty and trust, driving connectivity with our brands.
Raw Materials
Our highest raw material consumption for golf balls, in order, is polybutadiene, ionomers, zinc diacrylate, urethane, and coatings. We use multiple suppliers or multiple production facilities, some with geographic separation, to reduce the risk of raw material shortages. We source the raw materials for our golf glove and golf shoe businesses, and certain of the components for our golf shoe business, from third-party suppliers. Our golf club team employs the primary materials of steel, titanium, and aluminum and has five custom manufacturing locations around the globe with each being responsible for supply chain execution, allowing each region to respond to market specific needs or trends. For our golf gear and FootJoy apparel businesses, we source the finished products from select third-party vendors that have the necessary quality capabilities. 
Seasonality
Weather conditions in most parts of the world, including our primary geographic markets, generally restrict golf from being played year‑round, with many of our on‑course customers closed during the cold weather months. In general, during the first quarter, we begin selling our products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season. This initial sell‑in generally continues into the second quarter. Our second‑quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of sell‑through, in particular the amount of higher value discretionary purchases made by customers, which drives the level of reorders of the products sold during the first quarter. Our third‑quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business, and are generally lower than the second quarter, as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf

season. Our fourth‑quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of our key markets, but can also be affected by key product launches, particularly golf clubs. This seasonality, and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations – Product Life Cycles,” Item 7 of Part II to this report, as well as weather conditions. This seasonality affects sales in each of our reportable segments differently. In general, however, because of this seasonality, a majority of our sales and most of our profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year.
Research and Product Development
Innovating within a highly regulated environment presents unique challenges and opportunities that require a significant investment in people, facilities and financial resources, with separate dedicated R&D teams for each product category. We have six R&D facilities and/or test centers supported by approximately 190 scientists, chemists, engineers and technicians in aggregate. We are committed to continuous improvement and each R&D team is tasked to develop technology that will deliver better quality and performance products in each generation.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 we invested $51.5 million, $47.2 million and $48.1 million, respectively, in R&D.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We consider our patents and trademarks to be among our most valuable assets. We are dedicated to protecting the innovations created by our R&D teams by developing broad and deep patent and trademark portfolios across all product categories.
As a result, we have strong patent positions across our product categories and innovation spaces in which we operate, and have become the leader in obtaining golf ball and golf club patents worldwide. In addition, we believe we have more combined golf shoe and golf glove utility patents than all competitors combined. We have over 1,250 U.S. utility patents in golf balls, nearly 350 U.S. utility patents in golf clubs, wedges and putters and approximately 300 patents (including ex-U.S. and design patents) in golf shoes and gloves.
The following charts show our percentage of golf ball and golf club patents obtained in the last five years compared to our peers.

We own or license a large portfolio of trademarks, including for Titleist, Pro V1, Pro V1x, AVX, Pinnacle, AP1, AP2, TS, Vokey Design, Scotty Cameron, FootJoy, FJ, DryJoys, StaSof and ProDry. We protect our trademarks by obtaining registrations where appropriate and opposing or cancelling material infringements. We also have rights in several common law marks.
Competition
There are unique aspects to the competitive dynamic in each of our product categories.
The golf ball business is highly competitive. There are a number of well‑established and well‑financed competitors, including Callaway, SRI Sports Limited (Dunlop and Srixon brands) and Bridgestone (Bridgestone and Precept brands).
The golf club, wedge and putters markets in which we compete are also highly competitive and are served by a number of well‑established and well‑financed companies with recognized brand names, including Callaway, TaylorMade and Ping.
For golf balls and golf clubs, wedges and putters, we generally compete on the basis of technology, quality, performance and customer service.
In the golf gear market, there are numerous competitors in each product category and geographical market. Titleist golf gear generally competes on the basis of quality, performance, styling and customer service.
FootJoy’s significant worldwide competitors in golf shoes include Nike, Adidas and Ecco. FootJoy’s primary worldwide competitors in golf gloves include Callaway, Nike, TaylorMade and Adidas and a significant number of smaller companies with regional offerings and specialized golf glove products. In the golf apparel category, FootJoy has numerous competitors in each geographical market, including Nike, Adidas and Under Armour. FootJoy products generally compete on the basis of quality, performance, styling and price.
Environmental Matters
Our operations and properties are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes and the remediation of environmental contaminants. In the ordinary course of our manufacturing processes, we use paints, chemical solvents and other materials, and generate waste by‑products that are subject to these environmental laws.  We have incurred expenses in connection with environmental compliance.
We are also involved in ongoing investigations with federal and state environmental protection agencies and expect to incur future costs for past and current environmental issues relating to certain sites. See "Risk Factors - We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could subject us to liabilities, increase our costs or restrict our operations in the future."
Regulation
The Rules of Golf
The Rules of Golf set forth the rules of play and the rules for equipment used in the game of golf. The first documented rules of golf date to 1744 and the modern Rules of Golf have been in place for over 100 years. Dedicated golfers respect the traditions of the game and play by the Rules of Golf. As a result, premium‑positioned products are designed and manufactured to conform to the Rules of Golf.
The United States Golf Association, or the USGA, is the governing body for golf in the United States and Mexico. The USGA, in conjunction with the Royal and Ancient, or R&A, in St. Andrews, Scotland, writes, interprets and maintains the Rules of Golf. The R&A is the governing body for golf in all jurisdictions outside of the United States and Mexico. The R&A jointly writes, interprets and maintains the Rules of Golf with the USGA.
In addition to their role as rule makers, both the USGA and R&A conduct national championships and are involved in other efforts to maintain the history of golf and promote the health of the game.
The Rules of Golf set the standards and establish limitations for the design and performance of all balls and clubs. Many new regulations on golf balls and golf clubs have been introduced in the past 10 to 15 years, which we believe was one of the most active periods for golf equipment regulation in the history of golf.

Golf Balls
Historically, the USGA and R&A have regulated the size, weight, spherical symmetry, initial velocity and overall distance performance of golf balls. The overall distance standard was last revised in 2004.
Golf Clubs
The USGA and R&A have also focused on golf club regulations. In 1998, a limitation was placed on the spring‑like effect of driver faces. In 2003, limits were placed on club head dimensions and volume, as well as shaft length. In 2007, club head moment of inertia was limited. A rule change to allow greater adjustability in golf clubs went into effect on January 1, 2008. In August 2008, the USGA and R&A adopted a rule change further restricting golf club grooves by reducing the groove volume and limiting the groove edge angle allowable on irons and wedges. This rule change will not apply to most golfers until January 1, 2024. It was implemented on professional tours beginning in 2010 and was implemented in elite amateur competitions beginning in 2014. All products manufactured after December 31, 2010 must comply with the new groove specifications.
Our Position
In response to this regulatory dynamic, our senior management and R&D teams spend significant time and effort in developing and maintaining relationships with the USGA and R&A. We are an active participant in discussions with the ruling bodies regarding potential new rules and the rule making process. More importantly, our R&D teams are driven to innovate and continuously improve product technology and performance within the Rules of Golf. The development and protection of these innovations through aggressive patenting are essential to competing in the current market. As a long‑time industry participant and market leader, we are well‑positioned to continue to outperform the market in a rules constrained environment.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 5,209 associates worldwide. The geographic concentration of associates is as follows: 2,348 in the Americas, 468 in EMEA, and 2,393 employed in Asia Pacific. None of our associates are represented by a union. We believe that relations with our associates are positive.
