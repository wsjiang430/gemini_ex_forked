ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Introduction 
 Cryo-Cell International, Inc. (the Company or Cryo-Cell) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1989. The Company is organized in three reportable segments, cellular processing and cryogenic storage, with a current focus on the collection and preservation of umbilical cord blood and tissue stem cells for family use, the manufacture of PrepaCyte® CB Processing System (PrepaCyte CB) units, the processing technology used to process umbilical cord blood stem cells and cellular processing and cryogenic storage of umbilical cord blood stem cells for public use. The Company, in combination with its global affiliates, currently stores nearly 500,000 cord blood and cord tissue specimens worldwide for the exclusive benefit of newborn babies and possibly other members of their families. Founded in 1989, the Company was the worlds first private cord blood bank to separate and store stem cells in 1992. All aspects of its U.S.-based business operations, including the processing and storage of specimens, are handled from its headquarters facility in Oldsmar, Florida. The specimens are stored in commercially available cryogenic storage units at this technologically and operationally advanced facility. 
 In recent years, utilizing its infrastructure, experience and resources derived from its umbilical cord blood stem cell business, the Company has expanded its research and development activities to develop technologies related to stem cells harvested from sources beyond umbilical cord blood stem cells. During fiscal 2011, the Company introduced the advanced new cord tissue service, which stores a section of the umbilical cord tissue. The Company offers the cord tissue service in combination with the umbilical cord blood service. This service is growing; however, the umbilical cord blood service continues to be the Companys main focus. 
 Consistent with its fiduciary duties, the board of directors and management has reviewed and will continue to review strategic options and opportunities for the Company, in order to maximize shareholder value. These options may include, but are not limited to, strategic mergers or acquisitions, investments in other public and/or private companies, repurchases of RSA interests, a deregistration of the Companys common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or a going-private transaction. These options may or may not be related to the Companys current business. In order to undertake any of the aforementioned activities, the Company may take on substantial debt or equity capital which could increase the risk of investment in the Company.

Cord Blood Stem Cell Processing and Storage Business 
 Background of Business 
 Nearly fifty years ago researchers discovered that cells could be cryopreserved at extremely low temperatures and all cellular activity would cease until the specimens were thawed. Historically, cryopreservation was required for organ transplants, blood banking and medical research. Today, cryopreservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells gives individuals the opportunity to potentially take advantage of evolving cellular therapies and other medical technologies. 
 Hematopoietic stem cells are the building blocks of our blood and immune systems. They form the white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout the body and platelets that promote healing. Stem cells are found in bone marrow where they continue to generate cells throughout our lives. Stem cells can be stored in a cryogenic environment, and upon thawing, infused into a patient. They can be returned to the individual from whom they were taken (autologous) or donated to someone else (allogeneic). An individuals own bone marrow may be used for a transplant if the cancer has not entered the marrow system (metastasized). Otherwise, a marrow donor needs to be identified to provide the needed bone marrow. The availability of a marrow donor or matched stem cell specimen allows physicians to administer larger doses of chemotherapy or radiation in an effort to eradicate the disease. Stem cell therapies and transplants are used for both cancerous and non-cancerous diseases. 
 Stem cells are found in umbilical cord blood (cord blood stem cells) and can be collected and stored after a baby is born. Over 35,000 cord blood stem cell transplants have been performed to date. The Company believes that parents will want to save and store these cells for potential future use by their family, either for the donor or for another family member. Moreover, researchers believe they may be utilized in the future for treating diseases that currently have no cure. 
 The Company believes that the market for cord blood stem cell preservation is enhanced by global discussion on stem cell research developments and the current focus on reducing prohibitive health care costs. With the increasing costs of bone marrow matches and transplants, a newborns umbilical cord blood cells can be stored as a precautionary measure. Medical technology is constantly evolving which may provide new uses for cryopreserved cord blood stem cells. 
 Our Cord Blood Stem Cell Storage Services 
 The Company enters into storage agreements with its clients under which the Company charges a fee for the processing and testing and first year of storage of the umbilical cord blood. Thereafter, the client is charged an annual fee to store the specimen, unless the client has entered into a 21-year pre-paid storage plan or a lifetime pre-paid storage plan. 
 The Companys corporate headquarters are located in a nearly 18,000 square-foot state-of-the-art current Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Tissue Practice (cGMP/cGTP)-compliant facility. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 21 CFR Part 1271, effective in May 2005, requires human cellular and tissue-based products to be manufactured in compliance with good tissue practices (cGTPs). The Companys laboratory processing facility contains a Class 10,000 clean room and Class 100 environments for the processing of cord blood stem cells and other cellular tissues. In addition, the cellular products cryogenic storage area has been designed as a bunker, with enhanced provisions for security, building fortification for environmental element protection and back-up systems for operational redundancies. The Company believes that it was the first private bank to process cord blood in a technologically and 
 
5 
 
 operationally advanced cGMP/cGTP-compliant facility. The Companys facility, which also currently houses the Companys client services, marketing and administrative operations, is designed to accommodate a broad range of events such as client tours and open houses, as well as educational workshops for clinicians and expectant parents.

Cord Tissue 
 In August 2011, the Company introduced its advanced new cord tissue service, which stores a section of the umbilical cord tissue. Approximately six inches of the cord tissue is procured and transported to the Companys laboratory for processing, testing and cryopreservation for future potential use. Umbilical cord tissue is a rich source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs have many unique functions including the ability to inhibit inflammation following tissue damage, to secrete growth factors that aid in tissue repair, and to differentiate into many cell types including neural cells, bone cells, fat cells and cartilage. MSCs are increasingly being researched in regenerative medicine for a wide range of conditions including heart and kidney disease, ALS, wound healing and auto-immune diseases.    MSCs from several different tissues are being tested in clinical trials for efficacy. Specifically, cells derived from cord tissue are currently being used in many clinical trials. Disorders being treated include cardiomyopathy, ulcerative colitis, diabetes, anemia, autism and cirrhosis of the liver.

Public Banking 
 In June 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets (the Cord Purchase) of Cord:Use Cord Blood Bank, Inc., a Florida corporation (Cord:Use), in accordance with the definitive Asset Purchase Agreement between Cryo-Cell and Cord:Use (the Purchase Agreement), including without limitation Cord:Uses inventory of public cord blood units existing as of the closing date (the Public Cord Blood Inventory). The Public Cord Blood Inventory creates a large, ethnically diverse, high quality inventory of available cord blood stem cell units for those in need of life saving therapy. The Company collects cord blood units at hospitals in Florida, Arizona, California and Michigan. The Companys public inventory is stored in North Carolina, and the cord blood units are sold through the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) located in Minnesota, who ultimately distributes the cord blood units to transplant centers located in the United States, and around the world. 
Marketing 
 Marketing Approach 
 It is the Companys mission to inform expectant parents and their prenatal care providers of the potential medical benefits from preserving stem cells and to provide them the means and processes for collection and storage of these cells. Today, stem cell transplants are known and accepted treatments for approximately 80 diseases, a number of them life-threatening. With continued research in this area of medical technology, other therapeutic uses for cord blood stem cells are being explored. A vast majority of expectant parents are simply unaware that umbilical cord blood contains a rich supply of non-controversial stem cells and that they can be collected, processed and stored for the potential future use of the newborn and possibly related family members. A babys stem cells are a perfect match for the baby throughout its life and have a 1-in-4 chance of being a perfect match and a 3-in-4 chance of being an acceptable match for a sibling. There is no assurance, however, that a perfect match means the cells could be used to treat certain diseases of the newborn or a relative. Today, it is still common for the cord blood (the blood remaining in the umbilical cord and placenta) to be discarded at the time of birth as medical waste. 
 Despite the potential benefits of umbilical cord blood stem cell preservation, the number of parents of newborns participating in stem cell preservation is still relatively small compared to the number of births (four million per annum) in the United States. Some reasons for this low level of market penetration are the misperception of the high cost of stem cell storage and a general lack of awareness of the benefits of stem cell preservation programs. However, evolving medical technology could significantly increase the utilization of the umbilical cord blood for transplantation and/or other types of treatments. The Company believes it offers the highest quality, highest value service targeted to a broad base of the market. We intend to maximize our growth potential through our superior quality, value-driven competitive leadership position, product differentiation, an embedded client base, increased public awareness and accelerated market penetration. 
 Umbilical Cord Blood and Cord Tissue Services 
 The Company markets its cord blood stem cell preservation services directly to expectant parents and by distributing information through obstetricians, pediatricians, childbirth educators, certified nurse-midwives and other related healthcare professionals. The Company believes that its revenues have been facilitated by a variety of referral sources, resulting from high levels of customer satisfaction. New expectant parent referrals during fiscal 2018 were provided by physicians, midwives and childbirth educators, and by client-to-client referrals and repeat clients storing the stem cells of their additional children. 
 
7 
 
The Company has a national sales force to increase its marketing activities with its clinical referral sources, including physicians, midwives and hospitals. Promotional activities also include advertisements in clinical journals and telemarketing activities. In addition, the Company exhibits at conferences, trade shows and other meetings attended by medical professionals. Significant portions of client referrals to the Company are from medical caregiver professionals. 
 To increase awareness among expectant parent audiences, the Company continues to promote its service through internet marketing. Expectant parents have also received information via emails and internet marketing campaigns. 
 The Companys client support team advisors are available by telephone to enroll clients and educate both expectant parents and the medical community on the life-saving potential of cord blood stem cell preservation. 
 The Company continues to use its website, www.cryo-cell.com, to market its services and to provide resource information to expectant parents.    The site, which is frequently updated and improved, is divided into areas of interest, including sections for expectant parents, medical caregivers and investors. Expectant parents may request and receive information about the umbilical cord blood and cord tissue service and enroll online. Viewers may read about successful transplants using Cryo-Cell stored cord blood stem cells and access other topical information. Information on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition 
 Growth in the number of families banking their newborns cord blood stem cells has been accompanied by an increasing landscape of competitors. The Company competes against approximately 25 other national private cord blood banks. 
 Some of these competitors may have access to greater financial resources. Nevertheless, the Company believes it is currently well positioned to compete in the industry. Importantly, the Company believes that some competitors charge more for comparable (or even inferior) quality service. In addition, the Company possesses an industry-recognized AABB accreditation, and believes that it was the first private cord blood bank to process in a cGMP- and cGTP-compliant facility exceeding current FDA requirements. In November 2005, the Company was granted ISO 9001:2008 certification from BSI Americas, Inc., a leading quality management systems registrar. ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standards are internationally recognized as an effective framework for a quality management system. During 2014, the Company was granted FACT (the Foundation for the Accreditation for Cellular Therapy) accreditation. These achievements position Cryo-Cell as an industry quality leader as a cGMP- and cGTP-compliant private cord blood bank with ISO certification, AABB and FACT accreditations. 
 The Company believes that its longevity and experience; value-based pricing strategy; superior customer service; premier technical and operational expertise; state-of-the-art facilities; innovative marketing programs and its expansive client base will continue to provide a competitive advantage.

Government Regulation 
 The Company is required to register with the FDA under the Public Health Service Act because of its ongoing cellular storage business and is subject to FDA inspection. This requirement applies to all establishments engaged in the recovery, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, or distribution of any Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps) or the screening or testing of a cell or tissue donor. In addition, with the purchase of the manufacturing rights to the PrepaCyte CB Processing System on June 30, 2015, Cryo-Cell is required to register this product as a Medical Device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which is also subject to FDA inspection. At November 30, 2018 and November 30, 2017, the Company was in compliance with these requirements. 
 The division of FDA which regulates HCT/Ps is the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). The section of FDA Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) pertaining to cord blood is 21 CFR 1271. Since 2004, the FDA has formulated a Tissue Action Plan which consists of these three rules: 
 

1. | As of January 21, 2004, all cord blood banks are required to register with the FDA. Any cord blood bank which has a laboratory should be on the web page of FDA Registered Establishments.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The second rule was published May 20, 2004, and became effective May 25, 2005. It pertains to donor eligibility. This rule requires more screening of donors for communicable diseases.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The final rule establishes FDA standards of current Good Tissue Practice (GTP) for laboratories which process HCT/Ps. This rule was published November 19, 2004, became effective May 25, 2005, and is intended to prevent contamination or cross-contamination during the handling of HCT/Ps.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These three FDA rules apply only to cord blood processed on or after the effective date of May 25, 2005. The final rule allows the FDA to inspect cord blood laboratories to determine compliance with the provisions of 21 CFR Part 1271. As part of this oversight authority, the FDA conducts unannounced inspections of cord blood banks. 
 Upon execution of the acquisition of all of the assets of Cord:Use, the Company acquired the cord blood operations which included both public (PHS 351) and private (PHS 361) banks. The Company closed the Cord:Use location and maintains its operations in Oldsmar, FL. The new PHS 351 product is distributed under an IND (10-CBA) maintained by the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). The Company has continued the contract with Duke University initiated by Cord:Use to manufacture, test, cryopreserve, store and distribute the public cord blood units. The units are listed on the NMDP Single Point of Access Registry and are available to transplant centers worldwide. The Company is reimbursed via cost recovery for public cord blood units distributed for transplant through the NMDP. The donation of cord blood units in the public cord blood banking program functions under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Company adheres to HIPAA rules. The FDA does not require establishments that manufacture drugs (including biological products) and devices that are HCT/Ps for use under an investigational new drug application (IND) (21 CFR Part 312) to register and list their HCT/Ps until the HCT/P is approved through a biologics license application (BLA), new drug application (NDA), or premarket approval application (PMA); or cleared through a premarket notification submission (510(k)). 
 The PrepaCyte CB (Cord Blood) Processing System is intended for use in cell processing laboratories to process and store total nucleated cells (TNC) from human umbilical cord blood, prior to banking. The device is composed of three integrally-attached processing and storage containers (or a single processing container) with separation media. The system is 510K cleared as a Class II device. The division of the FDA which regulates this product is the Center of Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). Approval to market the device was determined by the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies. The section of FDA Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) pertaining to medical device is 21 CFR 800s. The requirements for compliance to this section include annual registration of the device, listing of devices with the FDA, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

Currently, the states of California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and New York require cord blood banks to be registered or licensed. The Company is currently registered or licensed to operate in these states. If the Company identifies other states with licensing requirements or if other states adopt such requirements, the Company would have to obtain licenses or registration to continue providing cord blood services in those states. 
 Federal and state laws govern the Companys ability to obtain and, in some cases, to use and disclose data that we may need to conduct certain activities. The HIPAA requires the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a series of regulations establishing standards for the electronic transmission of certain health information.    The Companys private cord blood bank operation is not subject to HIPAA because the Company does not engage in certain electronic transactions related to the reimbursement of healthcare providers and because blood and tissue procurement and banking activities are exempt. However, the healthcare providers that collect umbilical cord blood for the Companys customers are subject to HIPAA. The identifiable information shared is only what is permitted by HIPAA. In 2009, a portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified HIPAA under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act). While the Company is still not subject to HIPAA for the reasons stated above the Company may incur material expenses associated with compliance efforts. In addition, compliance may require management to spend substantial time and effort on compliance measures. If the Company fails to comply with HIPAA, it could suffer criminal and civil penalties. The civil penalties could include monetary penalties ranging from $100 per violation to $1.5 million depending on the level of violation. 
 The Company is also subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. These laws include the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), cGTPs, cGMPs, Environmental Protection Act and those of the local Department of Health. 
 OSHA requires all employers to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women through development and implementation of work standards, education, and training. OSHA enforces the standards developed under the Act, applicable to all employers in the U.S. and its territories. cGTPs are laws, enforced by the FDA, that define and govern methods used in the manufacture of Human Cells, Tissues, and cellular and tissue-based Products (HCT/Ps). Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) are laws, enforced by the FDA, that define and govern methods used in the manufacture of drugs and finished pharmaceuticals. Both of the latter federal practices, or laws, govern the Companys products. 
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) governs the management and proper disposal of products and by-products or waste. These products must be disposed in a manner that does not adversely affect the environment from which it came or where disposed of. The Department of Health on the local level primarily regulates systems and associated equipment employed in recovery activities such as back-up generators; therefore, governing specific internal processes. 
 Evolving legislation and regulations governing private cord blood banking in various jurisdictions throughout the world may impact the Companys international licensees. 
 In addition, as the organization grows and evolves, other legislation and regulations are expected to impact the Company. One such evolution involves activities that may be designated as or involve medical research or cooperative agreements associated with medical research. These types of activities are also governed by the FDA, specifying oversight by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB is a board or committee that approves the initiation of, and conducts periodic review of, biomedical research 
 
10 
 
 involving human subjects. The primary purpose of such review is to assure the protection of the rights and welfare of the human subjects. Governance of biomedical research is codified as laws by Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 56, and enforced by the FDA. Other medical research associated with clinical trials may require an Investigational New Drug Application (IND). Current Federal law requires that a drug be the subject of an approved marketing application before it is transported or distributed across state lines. Because a sponsor will likely want to ship the investigational drug to clinical investigators in many states, it must seek an exemption from that legal requirement. The IND is the means through which the sponsor technically obtains this exemption from the FDA. This approval would be required in the case of a clinical trial. 
 Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures 
 Since its inception, Cryo-Cell has entered into a number of business activities through subsidiaries and joint ventures, including the following activities and those described under International below. The Company continues to evaluate and pursue, certain opportunities for global expansion, on a selective basis, in which operational synergies and economic potential align with Cryo-Cells strategic direction. 
 Saneron CCEL Therapeutics, Inc. (Saneron). Saneron is the owner and/or exclusive licensee of certain technology developed by and/or in collaboration with the University of South Florida and the University of Minnesota. The technology covers various patents, patent applications and trade secrets for the therapeutic use of umbilical cord blood stem cells (U-CORD-CELL®) and Sertoli cells (SERT-CELL). As of November 30, 2018, and November 30, 2017, the Company had an ownership interest of approximately 33% in Saneron which is accounted for under the equity method. As of November 30, 2018, and November 30, 2017, the net Saneron investment, which represents underlying goodwill, is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets at $0. 
Revenue Sharing Agreements (RSAs) 
 The Company entered into RSAs prior to 2002 with various third and related parties. The Companys RSAs provide that in exchange for a non-refundable up-front payment, the Company would share for the duration of the RSA a percentage of its future revenue derived from the annual storage fees related to a certain number of specimens that originated from specific geographical areas. The RSAs have no definitive term or termination provisions. The sharing applies to the storage fees collected for all specified specimens in the area covered by the RSA up to the number covered in the RSA. When the number of specimens is filled, any additional specimens stored in that area are not subject to the RSA. As there are empty spaces resulting from attrition, the Company agrees to fill them as soon as possible. The Company reflects these up-front payments as long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company does not intend to enter into additional RSAs. 
 In the future, the Company could reverse the liability relating to the RSAs up-front payments over an appropriate period of time, based on the Companys expectations of the total amount of payments it expects to pay to the other party under the particular RSA. However, the RSAs do not establish a finite term or time frame over which to estimate the total payments and the Company had not previously estimated and has concluded that it is not currently practicable to estimate the projected cash flows under the RSAs. At present, the Company intends to defer the reversal of the liability, until such time as these amounts can be determined. During the periods when the Company defers the reversal of the liability, the quarterly payments made during these periods are treated as interest expense, which is recognized as the payments become due. In future periods, if a portion of the liability can be de-recognized based on the effective interest method, the payments will be allocated between interest and amortization of the liability. As cash is paid out to the other party during any period, the liability would be de-recognized based on the portion of the total anticipated payouts made during the period, using the effective interest method. That is, a portion of the payment would be recorded as interest expense, and the remainder would be treated as repayment of principal, which would reduce the liability. 
 
11 
 
Florida. On February 9, 1999, the previous Arizona RSAs were modified and replaced by an RSA for the state of Florida for a price of $1,000,000. The RSA applies to net storage revenues originating from specimens from within the state of Florida less a deduction for billing and collection fees. The RSA entitles the investors to revenues of up to a maximum of 33,000 storage spaces. 
 Illinois. In 1996, the Company entered into an RSA with a group of investors entitling them to an on-going 50% share of the Companys 75% share of the annual storage fees (net storage revenues) less a deduction for 50% of billing and collection expenses generated by specimens stored in the Illinois Masonic Medical Center for a price of $1,000,000. The RSAs were modified in 1998 to broaden the covered specimens to those originating in Illinois and its contiguous states and stored in Oldsmar, Florida for a maximum of up to 33,000 storage spaces. 
 Texas. On May 31, 2001, the Company entered into an RSA with Red Rock Partners, an Arizona general partnership, entitling them to on-going shares in a portion of the Companys net storage revenue generated by specimens originating from within the State of Texas for a price of $750,000. The investors are entitled to a 37.5% share of net storage revenues less a deduction for billing and collection fees for specimens originating in the State of Texas to a maximum of 33,000 storage spaces. During fiscal 2008, Red Rock assigned 50% of their interest in the agreement to SCC Investments, Inc., an Arizona corporation. Subsequent to November 30, 2009, SCC Investments, Inc. assigned its interest to SCF Holdings, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company. 
 The Company made total payments to all RSA holders of $671,245 and $589,399 for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company recorded an RSA accrual of $798,292 and $616,990 as of November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to interest owed to the RSA holders, which is included in accrued expenses in the Companys consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company also recorded interest expense of $848,024 and $730,778 for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which is reflected in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. 
 International 
 The Company enters into two types of licensing agreements and in both types, the Company earns revenue on the initial license fees. Under the technology agreements, the Company earns processing and storage royalties from the affiliates that process in their own facility. Under the marketing agreements, the Company earns processing and storage revenues from affiliates that store specimens in the Companys facility in Oldsmar, Florida. 
Technology Agreements 
 The Company has entered into a definitive License and Royalty Agreement with LifeCell International Private Limited, formerly Asia Cryo-Cell Private Limited, (LifeCell) to establish and market its umbilical cord blood and menstrual stem cell programs in India. 
 Per the License and Royalty Agreement with Lifecell, there is a $1,000,000 cap on the amount of royalties due to the Company per year and a $10,000,000 cap on the amount of royalties due to the Company for the term of the License and Royalty Agreement.    The cap(s) are calculated based on Lifecells fiscal year end, March 31st. As of the end of the Companys fiscal years ended November 30, 2018 and November 30, 2017, Lifecell had reached the $1,000,000 cap and paid the Company in full for Lifecells fiscal 
 
12 
 
 year ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Since inception of the License and Royalty Agreement, the Company has recorded $7,000,000 in royalty income due under the terms of the License and Royalty Agreement, of which, Lifecell has paid the Company $6,500,000 as of November 30, 2018. The balance of $500,000 is reflected as Accounts Receivable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 The following table details the processing and storage royalties earned for the technology agreements for fiscal years 2018 and 2017. The initial license fees and processing and storage royalties are reflected in licensee income in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

Marketing Agreements 
 The Company has definitive license agreements to market the Companys umbilical cord blood stem cell programs in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Pakistan.     
Employees 
 At November 30, 2018, the Company had 92 full-time employees and 9 part-time employees on the staff of the Company. Additional employees and staff will be hired on an as needed basis. The Company believes its relationship with its employees is good. None of our employees are members of any labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.
