   ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  Overview
  
 OCEES International Inc. (“OCEES”) was formed under the laws of Hawaii on January 21, 1998. Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation (“OTE Delaware”) was a Delaware corporation formed on October 18, 2010. In 2011, OCEES and OTE Delaware entered into a share exchange agreement. The transaction was treated as a merger of entities under common control as 100% of the stockholders of OCEES exchanged their shares for 100% of the outstanding shares of OTE Delaware.
  
 OTE Delaware used its proprietary technology to develop, build, own, and operate renewable energy systems, primarily in the Eastern and Western Caribbean Islands.
  
 On December 17, 2013, Broadband Network Affiliates, Inc. (“BBNA”), a Nevada corporation, changed its state domicile and became a Delaware corporation. On December 23, 2013, BBNA entered into a merger agreement with OTE Delaware, which was effective December 31, 2013. Upon completion of the merger, BBNA changed its name to Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation (“OTE”) and the former OTE Delaware ceased to exist. The transaction was treated as a reverse merger and recapitalization by OTE Delaware.
  
 We previously operated under the corporate name of TetriDyn Solutions, Inc. (“TetriDyn”). On March 10, 2017, TetriDyn entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with OTE. On May 9, 2017, TetriDyn consummated the acquisition of all outstanding equity interests of OTE pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, with a newly created Delaware corporation that is wholly owned by TetriDyn (“TetriDyn Merger Sub”), merging with and into OTE (the “Merger”) and OTE continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of TetriDyn. Effective upon the consummation of the Merger (the “Closing”), the OTE stock issued and outstanding or existing immediately prior to the Closing was converted at the Closing into the right to receive newly issued shares of TetriDyn common stock. As a result of the Merger, TetriDyn succeeded to the business and operations of OTE. In connection with the consummation of the Merger and upon the consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding common shares, TetriDyn filed with the Nevada Secretary of State an amendment to its articles of incorporation changing its name to “Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation.”
  
  Our Business
  
 We develop projects for renewable power generation, desalinated water production, and air conditioning using proprietary intellectual property designed and developed by our own experienced oceanographers, engineers, and marine scientists. Plants using our technologies are designed to extract energy from the temperature difference between warm surface ocean water and cold deep seawater at a depth of approximately 3,000 feet. We believe these technologies provide practical solutions to mankind’s fundamental needs for sustainable, affordable energy; desalinated water for domestic, agricultural, and aquaculture uses; and cooling, all without the use of fossil fuels.
  
   ●
 Ocean Thermal Electrical Conversion, known in the industry as “OTEC,” power plants are designed to produce electricity. In addition, some of the seawater running through an OTEC plant can be desalinated efficiently, producing fresh water for agriculture and human consumption.

 
   ●
 Seawater Air Conditioning, known in its industry as SWAC/LWAC, plants are designed to use cold water from ocean depths to provide air conditioning for large commercial buildings or other facilities. This same technology can also use deep cold water from lakes, known as Lakewater Air Conditioning or LWAC.

 
 Both OTEC and SWAC/LWAC systems can be engineered to produce desalinated water for potable, agricultural, and fish farming/aquaculture uses.

 Many applications of technologies based on ocean temperature differences between surface and deep seawater have been developed at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority, or NELHA, test facility (http://nelha.hawaii.gov), including applications for desalinated seawater, fish-farming, and agriculture. We believe our proprietary advances to existing technologies developed by others in the industry enhance their commercialization for the plants we propose to develop.
  
 We have recruited a scientific and engineering team that includes oceanographers, engineers, and marine scientists who have worked for a variety of organizations since the 1970s on several systems based on extracting the energy from the temperature differences between surface and deep seawater, including projects by NELHA, the Argonne National Laboratory (http://www.anl.gov), and others. Note: All URL addresses in this report are inactive textual references only. Our executive team members have complementary experience in leading engineering and technical companies and projects from start-up to commercialization.
  
 In addition, we expect to use our technology in the development of an OTEC EcoVillage, which should add significant value to our business. We will facilitate the development of sustainable living communities by creating an ecologically sustainable “OTEC EcoVillage” powered by 100% fossil-fuel free electricity. In the development, buildings will be cooled by energy-efficient and chemical-free systems, and water for drinking, aquaculture, and agriculture will be produced onsite. The OTEC EcoVillage project consists, in part, of an OTEC plant that will provide all power and water to about 400 residences, a hotel, and a shopping center, as well as models of sustainable agriculture, food production, and other economic developments. Each sale of luxury EcoVillage residences will support the development of environmentally responsible affordable communities in tropical and subtropical regions of the world currently in development. Our OTEC EcoVillage will be the first development in the world offering a net-zero carbon footprint. This will be our pilot project, launched to prove the viability of OTEC technology to provide affordable renewable energy for entire communities. We believe this project could be highly profitable and generate significant value for our shareholders. The U.S. Virgin Islands’ Public Service Commission has granted regulatory approval to us for an OTEC plant, and we have identified the specific plots of land for the site. The first draft of the master plan for the entire development has been completed.
  
  Our Vision
  
 Our vision is to bring these technologies to tropical and subtropical regions of the world where about three billion people live. Our market includes 68 countries and 29 territories with suitable sea depth, shore configuration, and market need; we plan to be the first company in the world to design and build a commercial scale OTEC plant and, to that end, have several projects in the planning stages. Our initial markets and potential projects include several U.S. Department of Defense bases situated in the Asia Pacific and other regions where energy independence is crucial. Currently, we have projects in the planning and development stages in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 Our Technology
  
 OTEC is a self-sustaining energy source, with no supplemental power required to generate continuous (24/7) electricity. It works by converting heat from the sun, which has warmed ocean surface water, into electric power, and then completing the process by cooling the plant with cold water from deep in the ocean. The cold water can also be used for very efficient air conditioning and desalinated to produce fresh water. OTEC has worked in test settings where there exists a natural temperature gradient of 20 degrees Celsius or greater in the ocean. We believe OTEC can deliver sustainable electricity in tropical and subtropical regions of the world at rates approximately 20-40% lower than typical costs for electricity produced by fossil fuels in those markets.
  
 Further, we believe that a small, commercial OTEC plant could offer competitive returns even in a market where the cost of electricity is as low as $0.30 per kilowatt-hour, or kWh. For example, the Inter-American Development Bank, an international bank providing development financing in Latin America and the Caribbean, reports that energy prices for hydrocarbon-generated power during 2010-2012 for 15 Caribbean countries averaged $0.33 per kWh, with a high of $0.43 per kWh in Antigua and Barbados. For the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Water and Power Authority of the Virgin Islands reported that as of February 1, 2017, the average price for electricity for commercial customers was nearly $0.40 per kWh. We believe that we have an opportunity to offer base-load energy (the amount of energy required to meet minimum requirements) pricing that is better than our customer’s next best alternative in the markets where electricity costs are $0.30 or more per kWh.

 Technology advancements have significantly brought the capital costs of OTEC down to make it competitive compared to traditional energy sources. Technology improvements include larger diameter seawater pipes manufactured with improved materials, increased pumping capabilities from OTEC depths, better understanding of material requirements in the deep ocean environment, more experience in deep water pipeline and cable installation techniques, and more accurate sea bottom mapping technology, which is required for platform positioning and pipe installation. The cold-water pipes at a demonstration site in Hawaii have been in continuous operation for more than 20 years, and the technology has improved significantly since the Hawaiian installation.
  
 We estimate that a small OTEC plant that delivers 13 megawatts (MWs) per hour for 30 years would currently cost approximately $350 million. This is the plant size that we typically propose for our initial target markets to meet 20% or more of their current demand for electricity and a large portion of their need for fresh drinking water and agricultural water. OTEC has been proven in test settings at NELHA, where a Department of Energy-sponsored OTEC plant operated successfully throughout the 1990s to produce continuous, affordable electricity from the sea without the use of fossil fuels. Spin-off technologies of desalination and seawater cooling, developed from the OTEC plant at NELHA, have also become economically and technically feasible.
  
 Finally, we believe the decreasing supply and increasing cost of fossil-fuel-based energy has intensified the search for renewable alternatives. We further believe that renewable energy sources, although traditionally more expensive than comparable fossil-fuel plants, have many advantages, including increased national energy security, decreased carbon emissions, and compliance with renewable energy mandates and air quality regulations. We believe these market forces will continue and potentially increase. In remote islands where shipping costs and limited economies of scale substantially increase fossil-fuel-based energy, renewable energy sources may be attractive. Many islands contain strategic military bases with high-energy demands that we believe would greatly benefit from a less expensive, reliable source of energy that is produced locally, such as OTEC.
  
 SWAC/LWAC is a process that uses cold water from locations such as the ocean or deep lakes to provide the cooling capacity to replace traditional electrical chillers in an air conditioning system. SWAC/LWAC applications can reduce the energy consumption of a traditional air-conditioning system by as much as 90%. Even when the capital cost amortization of building a typically sized SWAC/LWAC system providing 9,800 tons of cooling ($140-$150 million) are taken into account, SWAC/LWAC can save the customer approximately 25-40% when compared to conventional systems—we estimate savings can be as high as 50% in locations where air temperatures and electricity costs are high. Cooling systems using seawater or groundwater for large commercial structures are in use at numerous locations developed and operated by others worldwide, including Heathrow Airport, UK; Finland (Google Data Center); Cornell University, NY; Stockholm, Sweden; and the City of Toronto, Canada.
  
  How Our Technology Works
  
 OTEC uses the natural temperature difference between cooler deep ocean water at a depth of approximately 3,000 feet and warmer shallow or surface water to create energy. An OTEC plant project involves installing about 6.0 feet diameter, deep-ocean intake pipes (which can readily be purchased), together with surface water pipes, to bring seawater onshore. OTEC uses a heat pump cycle to generate power. In this application, an array of heat exchangers transfer the energy from the warm ocean surface water as an energy source to vaporize a liquid in a closed loop, driving a turbine, which in turn drives a generator to produce electricity. The cold deep ocean water provides the required temperature to condense vapor back into a liquid, thus completing the thermodynamic cycle, which is constantly and continuously repeated. The working fluid is typically ammonia, as it has a low boiling point. Its high hydrogen density makes ammonia a very promising green energy storage and distribution media. Among practical fuels, ammonia has the highest hydrogen density, including hydrogen itself, in either its low temperature, or cryogenic, and compressed forms. Moreover, since the ammonia molecule is free of carbon atoms (unlike many other practical fuels), combustion of ammonia does not result in any carbon dioxide emissions. The fact that ammonia is already a widely produced and used commodity with well-established distribution and handling procedures allows for its use as an alternative fuel. This same general principle is used in steam turbines, internal combustion engines, and, in reverse, refrigerators. Rather than using heat energy from the burning of fossil fuels, OTEC power draws on temperature differences of the ocean caused by the sun’s warming of the ocean’s surface, providing an unlimited and free source of energy.

 OTEC and SWAC/LWAC infrastructure offers a modular design that facilitates adding components to satisfy customer requirements and access to a sufficient supply of cold water. These components include reverse-osmosis desalination plants to produce drinkable water, bottling plants to commercialize the drinkable water, and off-take solutions for aquaculture uses (such as fish farms), which benefit from the enhanced nutrient content of deep ocean water. A further advantage of a modular design is that, depending on the patterns of electricity demand and output of the OTEC plant, a desalination plant can be run using the excess electricity capacity.
  
 
 Currently, OTEC requires a minimum temperature difference of approximately 20 degrees Celsius to operate, with each degree greater than this increasing output by approximately 10-15%. OTEC has potential applications in tropical and subtropical zones. OTEC is particularly well suited for tropical islands and coastal areas with proximate access to both deep water and warm surface water. These communities are typically subject to high and fluctuating energy costs ranging from $0.28-$0.75 per kWh, as they rely on importing fossil fuels for power generation. Data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy website indicated that at least 68 countries and 29 territories around the globe appear to meet these criteria.
  
 The world’s largest OTEC power plant to date is operational at the NELHA facility in Hawaii and is connected to the electrical grid. It provides base-load electricity produced by OTEC to about 150 homes. Around the world, a couple of other successful developmental and experimental plants have been built, and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, has stated that: “The qualitative analysis of the technical readiness of OTEC by experts at this workshop suggest that a <10 MWe floating, closed-cycle OTEC facility is technically feasible using current design, manufacturing, deployment techniques and materials.” We believe that we have sufficient skill and knowledge to now commercialize 5-MW to 30-MW land-based OTEC plants, using off-the-shelf components, including the cold-water piping.
  
 SWAC/LWAC is a significantly more cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to implement air-conditioning using cold water sourced from lakes or, analogous with OTEC, deep ocean water, rather than from an electric chiller. Comparing Federal Energy Management Program engineering efficiency requirements of approximately 0.94 kilowatts of electricity per ton of cooling capacity with our own engineering estimates of 0.09 kilowatts of electricity per ton of cooling capacity, as calculated by DCO Energy, our engineering, procurement, and construction partner, we estimate that SWAC/LWAC systems can reduce electricity consumption by up to 80-90% when compared to conventional systems. Therefore, we believe energy reductions may make SWAC/LWAC systems well-suited for large structures, such as office complexes, medical centers, resorts, data centers, airports, and shopping malls. We believe that other SWAC/LWAC plants we may develop will likely achieve similar efficiencies. There are examples of proven successful SWAC/LWAC systems in use, including a large 79,000-ton system used to cool buildings in the downtown area of the City of Toronto, Canada; Google’s data center in Finland operates a SWAC/LWAC system that uses waters from the Baltic Sea to keep servers cool and a system with more than 18,000 tons of cooling is in operation at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. On January 10, 2018, William S. (Lanny) Joyce joined our board of advisors. Mr. Joyce was the Director of Utilities and Energy Management in the Energy and Sustainability Department at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. Mr. Joyce initiated and was project manager for the LWAC deep lake water cooling project, an innovative and award-winning project completed in 2000 that provides all of the chilled water production on the central campus utilizing a renewable resource and 86% less energy.

  OTEC Versus Other Energy Sources
  
 The construction costs of power plants using any technology are much higher in remote locations, such as tropical islands, than on the mainland of the United States, principally due to the need to transport materials, components, other construction supplies, and labor not available locally. There are also considerations that make those other technologies less attractive in those areas. We believe the consistency of OTEC over its life provides clear advantages over other power-generation technology in the tropical and subtropical markets, because its base-load power (available at all times and not subject to fluctuations throughout the day) is an important asset to the small transmission grid, which is typical in these regions.
  
 Combined-cycle natural gas plants typically need to be capable of generating several hundred MWs to attain the lower cost per kilowatt installed values to make the plant economically feasible. Tropical locations do not have large enough grids and market demand to make that plant size reasonable. Further, tropical locations frequently do not have domestic fuel supplies, requiring fuel to be imported. In order to import natural gas, it must be liquefied for shipment and then vaporized at the location. There are initial cost and public safety concerns with such facilities. In addition, gas-fired plants emit undesirable nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide, and volatile organic compounds.
  
 Solar applications continue to increase as the cost and effectiveness of photovoltaic panels improve. However, we estimate that the cost to install solar panels in tropical regions remains high. Beyond the issues with shipping and labor costs that all construction must overcome, the design and building code requirements are tougher in storm-prone areas subject to potential wind damage from hurricanes, earthquakes, and typhoons than are typically encountered in mainland nontropical installations. Support structures must be more substantial in order to hold the solar panels in place in case of hurricane-force winds. Solar power, like wind power, places substantial stress on an electrical grid. Since the input of both of these sources is subject to weather conditions, they cannot be considered a reliable supply of power, and back-up capacity is necessary. Further, instantaneous changes in output due to sporadic cloud cover create transient power flow to the grid, creating difficulties in maintaining proper voltages and stability. OTEC is a stabilizing source to the grid, providing constant and predictable power, and has no emissions. The ability of OTEC to provide constant, continuous power is a large benefit as compared to any of the other renewable options available.
  
 Our estimated price for OTEC-generated power of approximately $0.30 per kWh under current economic conditions, which can be as low as $0.18 net per kWh with maximum efficiency and revenue from water production, is also constant both throughout the year and over a plant’s life. OTEC’s power price, determined almost entirely by the amortization of its initial cost, is a protection against inflation and rising interest rates, which greatly affect coal and oil. Customers in our target markets currently pay from $0.35 to as high as $0.60 per kWh for power from coal and oil-fueled power plants. However, imported fuels are subject to price volatility, which has a direct impact on the cost of electricity and adds operating risk during the life of a plant. The fuel handling to allow for the shipping, storage, and local transport is expensive, a potential source of damaging fuel spills and a basis for environmental concerns. Fossil-fuel plants create pollution, emit carbon dioxide, and are visually unappealing, which is of particular concern in tropical areas renowned for their clear, pristine air and beauty. We project OTEC can save these markets up to 40%, compared to their current electrical costs, and when revenues from fresh drinking water, aquaculture, and agriculture production are considered, the justification is even more compelling.
  
  Overview of the Market and the Feasibility of OTEC in Current Market Conditions
  
 We believe that OTEC is now an economically, technologically, and environmentally competitive power source, especially for developing or emerging countries in certain tropical and subtropical regions contiguous to oceans. Our natural target markets are communities in countries around the Caribbean, Asia, and the Pacific. These locations are typically characterized by limited infrastructure, high-energy costs, mostly imported or expensively generated electricity, and frequently with significant fresh water and food shortages. These are serious limitations on economic development, which we believe our OTEC technology can address.
  
 Data presented to the Sustainable Use of Oceans in the Context of the Green Economy and the Eradication of Poverty workshop in Monaco in 2011 by Whitney Blanchard of the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, show that at least 98 nations and territories using an estimated five terawatts of potential OTEC net power are candidates for OTEC-power systems. Blanchard specifically notes that Hawaii, Guam, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are suitable for OTEC.

 Over the past decade, there have been substantial changes in many areas that have now made the commercialization of OTEC a reality. First and foremost is the price of oil, which until 2006/2007 had been relatively inexpensive.
  
 Recent oil prices have been volatile, owing in large part to political instability in the Middle East and elsewhere. Crude oil prices averaged $71.40 in 2018. Oil prices are almost triple the 13-year low of $26.55/bbl on January 20, 2016. Six months before that, oil had been $60/bbl (June 2015). A year earlier, it had been $100.26/bbl (June 2014).
  
 Facts like these have resulted in increased attention and interest in OTEC in the commercial sector and among candidates. With OTEC power, customers can decouple the price of electricity from the price of oil.
  
 The International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook expects liquid natural gas export capacity to grow rapidly in the short term, with major new sources of supply coming mostly from Australia and the United States.
  
 Liquid natural gas prices have collapsed, in part because demand is turning out to be weaker than some previously anticipated. Additionally, many rules and regulations are in effect to mitigate the environmental issues associated with liquid natural gas extraction, transportation, and storage, adding significant costs.
  
 According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in the United States, nearly 28.5% of 2016 greenhouse gas emissions was generated primarily from burning fossil fuel for our cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes. Over 90% of the fuel used for transportation is petroleum-based, which includes gasoline and diesel.
  
 The electric power sector accounted for 28.4% of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2016.
  
 According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: “Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels have significantly increased since 1900. Since 1970, CO2 emissions have increased by about 90%, with emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributing about 78% of the total greenhouse gas emissions increase from 1970 to 2011.”
  
 Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity have increased by about 12% since 1990 as electricity demand has grown and fossil fuels have remained the dominant source for generations.
  
 Fossil-fuel-fired power plants are a significant source of domestic carbon dioxide emissions, the primary cause of global warming. To generate electricity, fossil-fuel-fired power plants use natural gas, petroleum, coal, or any form of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from such materials.
  
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration states that renewable energy plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using renewable energy can reduce the use of fossil fuels, which are major sources of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. The consumption of biofuels and other nonhydroelectric renewable energy sources more than doubled from 2000 to 2017, mainly because of state and federal government requirements and incentives to use renewable energy. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that U.S. renewable energy consumption will continue to increase through 2050.
  
 People in many countries today, including the United States, are concerned with environmental issues caused by fossil-fuel-generated power. Gallup surveys find public acceptance of climate change is rising. The number of Americans that the organization terms “concerned believers” on climate change has risen from 37% in 2015 to 47% in 2016 and to 50% in the spring of 2017. NASA has long confirmed the scientific consensus that the Earth’s climate is warming.

 The international concern about the harmful effects of climate change led to the negotiation of the Paris Agreement in December 2015 as the culmination of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. The agreement provides for members to reduce their carbon output as soon as possible and to do their best to keep global warming to no more than two degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. In order to achieve the desired results, there would have to be a worldwide reduction in emissions from fossil fuels and a shift to renewable resources. President Donald Trump has pulled the United States out of the Paris accord, but other Americans are standing with the world to help fight the ‘existential crisis’ of global warming, A coalition of 14 U.S. states, including California and New York, have said they are on track to meet the U.S. target of a 26-28% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, compared to 2005 level.
  
 In November 2017, the United Nations Climate Conference opened in Bonn, Germany, with the aim of a greater ambition for climate action, as the world body’s weather agency issued a stark warning that 2017 was set to be among the three hottest years on record.
  
 We believe the ongoing concern about environmental issues and the price instability of fossil-fuel prices are motivation for increased commercial interest in OTEC, renewed activity in the commercial sector, and increased interest among communities and agencies that recognize the potential benefits of this technology, including the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of the Interior territories.
  
 In the last four years, several large companies have used their OTEC technology experience to introduce OTEC systems worldwide, supporting the argument that the technology is now at the point where it can be introduced at a commercial level:
  
   ●
 In June 2014, the French companies, Akuo Energy and DCNS (now Naval Energies), were funded to construct and install a number of OTEC plants adding up to 16 MWs of power generation outside the coastline of Martinique in the Caribbean. This is by far the biggest OTEC project announced to date, and the European Union has allocated €72 million (about $82 million at current exchange rates) for this purpose. DCNS (now Naval Energies) is our teaming partner for potential projects in the Caribbean.

 
   ●
 Since early 2014, we have been working with several industrialized and developing countries, including U.S. Virgin Islands, The Bahamas, Cayman Islands, and others, and investigating suitable OTEC sites, infrastructural solutions, and funding opportunities.

 
   ●
 Two nongovernmental organizations promoting OTEC have been created: OTEC Foundation (based in The Netherlands) and OTEC Africa (based in Sweden)

 
   ●
 New technological advances for larger and more robust deep seawater pipes and more efficient and cost-effective heat exchangers, pumps, and other components have, in our opinion, further improved the economics for OTEC.

 
   ●
 Many countries, including a large number of Caribbean nations, now have renewable energy standards and are looking at ways to reduce their carbon footprint, decouple the price of electricity from the volatile price of oil, and increase energy security. Along with these countries, we are aware that Hawaii, U.S. territories, and the U.S. Department of Defense are looking at OTEC as a possible source of renewable energy and water for drinking, fish farming, and agriculture.

 
   ●
 The NELHA demonstration OTEC plant in Hawaii is producing 100 kilowatts of sustainable, continuous electricity annually and is powering a neighborhood of 120 homes. A potential next phase for OTEC development at NELHA is being considered by an international consortium under 2010 Okinawa-Hawaii clean energy agreement, which was extended in 2015.

 
   ●
 BARDOT Group, a French SME specialized in subsea engineering and equipment manufacturing for offshore energy, stated it has signed a contract for the first commercial OTEC system to be installed in an eco-resort in Maldives.

 Global acceptance of man’s influence on climate change may also contribute to a shift in the demand for OTEC. As evidenced by the Paris Agreement reached in December 2015 to combat climate change, 195 nations expressly recognized that conventional fossil-fuel powered energy technologies affect global climate change and the need to embrace a sustainable future in energy and water. Low-lying coastal countries (sometimes referred to as small island developing states) that tend to share similar sustainable development challenges, including small but growing populations, limited resources, remoteness, susceptibility to natural disasters, vulnerability to external shocks, excessive dependence on international trade, and fragile environments, have embraced this recognition and are keenly aware that they are on the frontline of early impact of sea level rise and are aggressively trying to embrace sustainable-energy alternatives. This is a major driving force for OTEC in primary early markets.
  
 Recent international political instability in fossil-fuel-producing regions and oil price volatility have exposed the criticality of energy security and independence for all countries. The need to have a tighter control of domestic energy requirements is a matter of increasing international concern. Continued reliance on other countries (particularly those in oil-producing regions) is not a favorable option any longer. We believe these considerations will continue to drive renewable research and commercialization efforts that benefit technologies with global potential to replace fossil-fuel-based energy systems and benefit from base-load capabilities like OTEC.
  
 Our current management team has led the development of the business since 2010 and has established a pipeline of potential projects, which include one signed 20-year energy services agreement, six signed memoranda of understanding, and a written agreement to support Lockheed Martin Corporation in proposing to the U.S. Navy a SWAC/LWAC system for a military base in the Indian Ocean. The projects under these agreements included the designs for OTEC, SWAC/LWAC, or a combination of both plants in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Bahamas, an island in the Indian Ocean, and in East Africa. The Public Services Commission of the U.S. Virgin Islands has approved our application to be a “qualified facility” and build a 15MW OTEC plant on the island of St. Croix. In addition to the OTEC plant, we are negotiating additional opportunities to supply potable water to the U.S. Virgin Islands government.
  
 Discussions are ongoing with Lockheed Martin Corporation to continue our relationship with it for the SWAC/LWAC project for the U.S. Department of Defense, Department of the Navy. We are discussing both OTEC and SWAC/LWAC projects with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Secretary of Commerce for Puerto Rico. Currently, two projects are in the planning and discussion phase:
  
   ●
 EcoVillage powered by an OTEC plant for Puerto Rico; and

 
   ●
 Eco Village powered by an OTEC plant for the U.S. Virgin Islands.

 
 We have provided a detailed study and designs for OTEC and/or SWAC/LWAC to:
  
   ●
 Lockheed Martin Corporation for an SWAC/LWAC system to be built for the U.S. Navy Base in Diego Garcia. We completed our preliminary assessment and in early 2018, we briefed the preliminary assessment to the U.S. Navy at a design charrette meeting. 

 
   ●
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture for a combined OTEC/SWAC/LWAC plant for Guam.

 
   ●
 The Legislature of the U.S. Virgin Islands for an OTEC plant for the island of St. Croix.

 
 Having successfully developed this pipeline of opportunities, we believe that it is now appropriate to seek additional funding to further progress and build up our engineering and technical teams, develop our intellectual property, file patents for several OTEC technical systems, and advance our pipeline of current opportunities to support our growth strategy.

  Our Competition
  
 We compete in the development, construction, and operation of OTEC and SWAC/LWAC plants with other operators that develop similar facilities powered by other energy sources, primarily oil, natural gas, nuclear energy, and solar power. These traditional energy sources have well-established infrastructures for production, delivery, and supply, with well-known commercial terms. In developing our OTEC and SWAC/LWAC plants, we will need to satisfy our customers that these technologies are sound and economical, which may be a challenge until and unless we have an established successful operating history. The energy industry is dominated by an array of companies of all sizes that have proven technologies and well-established fuel sources from a number of suppliers.
  
 We expect that we will encounter increasing competition for OTEC and SWAC/LWAC plants. Other firms with greater financial and technical resources are focusing commercialization of these technologies. This includes, for example, Akuo Energy and DCNS (now Naval Energies) and Bardot Energy of Paris, France. Our competitors may benefit from collaborative relationships with countries, including a large number of Caribbean nations that now have renewable-energy standards and are looking at ways to reduce their carbon footprint, decouple the price of electricity from the volatile price of oil, and increase energy security. Other competitors may have advantageous relationships with authorities such as Hawaii, U.S. territories, and the U.S. Department of Defense, which are looking at OTEC as a possible source of renewable energy and water for drinking, fish farming, and agriculture.
 
 We cannot assure that we will be able to compete effectively as the industry grows and becomes more established and as OTEC and SWAC/LWAC plants become more accepted as viable and economic energy solutions. 
  
 We believe competition in this industry is and will be based on technical soundness and viability, the economics of plant outputs as compared to other energy sources, developmental reputation and expertise, financial capability, and ability to develop relationships with potential customers. All of these factors are outside our control.
  
  Our Operational Strategy and Economic Models
  
 We have developed economic models of costs and potential revenue structures that we will seek to implement as we develop OTEC and SWAC/LWAC projects.
  
  OTEC Projects
  
 The estimated construction costs for a 20-MW plant are approximately $445 million. The hard costs of approximately $301 million consist of the power system and platform construction and piping, which make up 68% of the total. The remaining 32% consists of other construction costs and the deployment of the cold water pipe and soft costs of approximately $58 million for design, permits and licensing, environmental impact assessment, bathymetry, contractor fees, and insurance.
  
 Once operational, the capacity factor, which is the projected percent of time that a power system will be fully operational, considering maintenance, inspections, and estimated unforeseen events, is expected to be 95% annually. This factor is used in our financial calculations, which means the plant will not be generating revenue for 5% of the year. Most fossil-fuel plants have capacity factors around 90%, as a result of the major maintenance for high-temperature boilers, fossil-fuel feed in systems, safety inspections, cleaning, etc. The normal maintenance cycle for the pumps, turbine, and generators used in the OTEC plant is typically every five years. This includes the cleaning of the heat exchangers and installation of new seals.
  
 We anticipate that project returns will be comprised of two components: First, as the project developer, we will seek a lump-sum payment as a development fee at the time of closing the project financing for each project. These payments will be allocated toward reimbursement of development costs and perhaps a financial return at the early stage of each project. The development fee will vary, but initially we will seek a fee of approximately 3% of the project cost, payable upon closing project financing. Second, we will retain a percentage of equity in the project, with a goal to retain a minimum of 51% of the equity in any OTEC project in order to participate in operating revenues.

 We will seek to generate revenue from OTEC plants from contract pricing charged on an energy-only price per kWh or on the basis of a generating capacity payment priced per kilowatt per month and an energy usage price per kWh. In many of the countries of the world where we intend to build OTEC and SWAC/LWAC plants, water is in short supply. In some locations, water is considered the more important commodity. Depending on the part of the world in which the plant is built, in addition to revenue from power generation, supplying water for drinking, fish farming, and agriculture would significantly increase plant revenue.
  
 We cannot assure that we can maintain the revenue points noted above, that any fees received will offset development costs incurred to date, or that any operating plant will generate revenue.
  
 SWAC/LWAC Projects
  
 The estimated construction costs are approximately $150 million. The hard costs of approximately $91 million consist of piping and installation, which make up 60% of the total. The remaining 40% consists of the pump house, central utility plant (CUP), mechanical and engineering equipment, design, and other contingency costs and soft costs of approximately $30 million consist of the CUP license, permits, environmental impact assessment, bathymetry, and insurance.
  
 Under our economic model, we will seek to generate revenue at two stages of the project. First, as the project developer, we will seek a lump-sum payment of a development fee equal to approximately 3% of the project cost at the time of closing the project financing for each project. These payments would provide us with income at the early stage of each project. If we are able to negotiate a development fee, we estimate that it will vary, but typically will be in the $2,500,000-$3,500,000 range. The second component of project returns is based upon the percentage of equity we will retain in the project.
  
 SWAC/LWAC contract revenue will be based typically on three charges:
  
   ●
 Fixed Price–this is based upon the capital costs of the project paid over the term of the debt and with the intention of covering the costs of debt.

 
   ●
 Operation and Maintenance–this payment covers the cost of the labor and fixed overhead needed to run the SWAC/LWAC system, as well as any traditional chiller plant operating to fulfill back-up or peak-load requirements.

 
   ●
 Chilled Water Payment–this is a variable charge based on the actual chilled water use and chilled water generated both by the SWAC/LWAC and conventional system at the agreed upon conversion factors of kilowatt/ton and current electricity costs in U.S. dollars per kWh.

 
 We will seek to structure project financing with the goal of retaining 100% of the equity in any SWAC/LWAC project. We cannot assure that we will recover project development costs or realize a financial return over the life of the project.
  
  Our Project Timeline
  
 We have not developed, designed, constructed, and placed into operation any OTEC or SWAC/LWAC plants. However, based on our planning process and early development experience to date, we estimate that it will take approximately two to four years or more, depending on local conditions, including regulatory and permitting requirements, to take a project from a preliminary memorandum of understanding with a potential power or other product purchaser to completion and commencement of operation.

  Our Construction and Components
  
 Once we have designed the system, we will review the design with our engineering, procurement, and construction partner to maximize the chances that the project can be delivered according to plan and on budget. We expect our construction contracts to be at a fixed price and to include penalties if the construction timetable is missed. We may, but are not obligated to, engage DCO Energy to construct our plants or serve as our owners’ engineer.
  
 In our systems, the two most important components are heat exchangers and deep-water intake pipes. Although there are multiple providers of each of these components, the supply of the best components comes from just a few companies globally. We expect to source our deep-water intake pipes from Pipelife of Norway, the only company we know of that makes pipes of sufficient quality, strength, and diameter (2.5 meters) to support our planned OTEC plants. However, we expect that we could work around a lack of supply from Pipelife by using multiple smaller pipes that are widely available on the market, although this would increase our construction costs.
  
 We will also need the highest quality, large heat exchangers for our systems; heat exchangers represent a large percentage of the projected costs of our OTEC and SWAC/LWAC systems and also account for a significant portion of the design complexity inherent in commercial OTEC and SWAC/LWAC designs. Our relationship with Alfa Laval for heat exchangers provides us with the size and quality heat exchangers that we expect to need, although we believe there are several other companies that could provide us with adequate supply of these devices meeting our specifications if we need to source from them.
  
 Other major components, such as ammonia turbines, generators, and pumps, are manufactured by several multinational companies, including General Electric and Siemens.
  
  Our Operations
  
 For OTEC electricity-generating facilities, we intend to enter into 20- to 30-year power purchase agreements, or PPAs, pursuant to which the project would supply fixed-price, baseload electricity to satisfy the minimum demand of the purchaser’s customers. This PPA structure allows customers to plan and budget their energy costs over the life of the contract. For our SWAC/LWAC systems, we intend to enter into 20- to 30-year energy service agreements, or ESAs, to supply minimum quantities of chilled water for use in a customer’s air conditioning system.

 We anticipate that operations of OTEC and SWAC/LWAC plants will be subcontracted to third parties that will take responsibility for ensuring the efficient operation of the plants. These arrangements may reduce our exposure to operational risk, although they may reduce our financial return if actual operating costs are less than the subcontract payments. We cannot assure that any OTEC and SWAC/LWAC plants will permit the PPAs and ESAs to yield minimum target internal rates of return. Our first projects are likely to have lower returns than subsequent projects. Variances in internal rates of return may occur due to a range of factors, including availability and structure of project financing and localized issues such as taxes, some of which may be outside of our control.
  
 We expect our OTEC contract pricing will be charged either on an energy-only price per kWh or on the basis of a capacity payment priced per kilowatt per month and an energy usage price per kWh. We cannot assure that this pricing will enable us to recoup our funding costs and capital repayments and allow us to earn a profit.
 
  Marketing Strategies
  
 Our marketing and sales efforts are managed and directed by our chairman and chief executive officer, Jeremy P. Feakins, who has 35 years’ experience of senior-level sales in both commercial and governmental markets. Our marketing campaign has focused on explaining to potential customers the economic, environmental, and other benefits of OTEC and SWAC/LWAC through personal contacts, industry interactions, and our website.
  
 Our target markets are comprised of large institutional customers that typically include governments, utilities, large resorts, hospitals, educational institutions, and municipalities. We market to them directly through personal meetings and contact by our chief executive officer and other key members of our team. We also make extensive use of centers of influence either to heighten awareness of our products in the minds of key customers’ decision-makers or to secure face-to-face meetings and preliminary agreements between our customers and our chief executive officer.
  
 Sales cycles in our business are extremely long and complex and often involve multiple meetings with governmental, regulatory, electric utility, and corporate entities. Therefore, we cannot predict when or if any of the projects we currently have under development will progress to the signed contract or operational phase and generate revenue. We do not expect sales to be seasonal or cyclical.
  
  Material Regulation
  
 Our business and products are subject to material regulation. However, because we contemplate offering our products and services in different countries, the specific nature of the regulatory requirements will be wholly dependent on the nation where the project will be located and the national, state, and local regulations that apply at that location. 
  
 In all cases, we expect the level of regulation will be material and will require significant permitting and ongoing compliance during the life of the project. The most significant regulations will likely be environmental and will include mitigating possible adverse effects during both the construction and operational phases of the project.
  
 However, we believe that the limited plant site disturbance of both SWAC/LWAC and OTEC projects, together with the significantly lower emissions that result from these projects as compared to fossil-fuel electrical generation, will make compliance with all such regulation manageable in the normal course.
  
 The second most significant regulations will likely involve coordination with existing infrastructure. We believe compliance with this type of regulation is a routine civil engineering coordination process that exists for all new buildings and infrastructure projects of all types. Again, we believe that the design of both SWAC/LWAC and OTEC projects can readily be modified to avoid interference with existing infrastructure in most cases.

  Intellectual Property
  
 We use, or intend to employ in the performance of our material contracts, intellectual property rights in relation to the design and development of OTEC plants. Our intellectual property rights can be categorized broadly as proprietary know-how, technical databases, and trade secrets comprising concept designs, plant design, and economic models. Additionally, we have applied to register the trademark TOO DEEP® at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the provision of desalinated deep ocean water for consumption. The trademark has been “published for opposition” as of February 12, 2019.
  
 We may apply for patents for components of our intellectual property for OTEC and SWAC/LWAC systems, including novel or new methodologies for cold-water piping, heat exchanges, and computer-aided design programs. We cannot assure that any patents we seek will be granted.
  
 Our intellectual property has been developed by our employees and is protected under employee agreements confirming that the rights in the inventions and developments made by the employees are our property. Confidential information is protected by nondisclosure agreements we entered into with prospective partners or other third parties with which we do business.
  
 We have not received any notification from third parties that our processes or designs infringe any third-party rights, and we are not aware of any valid and enforceable third-party intellectual property rights that infringe our intellectual property rights. Currently, there is no patent for any company for OTEC technology.
  
  Employees
  
 We currently have five employees, consisting of one officer, three engineers/technicians, and one general and administrative employee, and three consultants. There are no collective-bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced work interruptions or strikes. We believe our relationship with employees is good, and we provide health and life insurance for all employees.
