ITEM 1.    BUSINESS. 
Company Overview 
 Calyxt was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2010 and is a majority-owned subsidiary of Cellectis, a leading gene-editing company focused on the development of immuno-oncology therapeutics. 
 We are a healthy food ingredient company. We leverage proprietary intellectual property, our technical expertise, and an end-to-end supply chain toward our mission of Making the Food You Love a Healthier ChoiceTM. 
 Using our proprietary technologies and expertise, including TALEN gene-editing technology exclusively licensed to us in the field of agriculture, we develop food crops with targeted traits quickly and more cost effectively than traditional methods. Our technologies enable precise cuts to DNA in a single plant cell using the plants natural repair machinery. This allows us to make our desired genome edit and regenerate the single cell into a full plant that includes this gene edit. We believe that we can identify a consumer need and develop a product from concept to fork in cycles as short as six years by utilizing these proprietary technologies. 
 We believe that we are well-positioned to address consumer preferences that are evolving to demand healthier, more nutritionally rich foods. To bring our consumer-centric products to the marketplace, we intend to repurpose and leverage existing supply chain capacity by contracting, tolling or partnering with players in the existing supply chain, such as seed production companies, seed distributors, farmers, crushers, millers, and refiners. We expect this will allow us to apply our resources to maximizing innovation and product development while minimizing our capital expenditures and overhead. We intend to strategically out-license our intellectual property to maximize our market opportunity. 
 Our first product is a High Oleic Soybean designed to produce a healthier oil that has increased heat stability with zero trans fats per serving. We completed our first sales of our High Oleic Soybean Oil and High Oleic Soybean Meal in the first quarter of 2019. Among our other product candidates are other soybean varieties and a high fiber wheat. 
 Our current commercial focus is North America. This may expand over time to other geographies, subject to customer demand and regulatory requirements, among other factors. We also intend to explore the ability to add value through our existing product candidates once they are commercialized by combining traits in the same crop, which may allow us to deliver products with additional benefits without adding significant cost. 
 Market and Industry Overview 
 Consumers have developed an increasingly heightened awareness of the role that dietary habits play in long-term wellness. This trend is especially prevalent in wealthier, developed nations where consumers have greater access to information that is helping to shift their consumption habits. In the United States and other developed nations buying habits have been creating dynamic shifts in the grocery aisle. Consumers view food as a key to good health. More food products are being launched that go beyond basic nutrition to support health, digestive health, and higher energy levels. Locally sourced foods with a direct-to-consumer model are becoming more attractive and the demand for transparency in food sourcing, production and labeling is gaining traction. We believe that as consumers continue the shift from a traditional production-driven food culture to a modern demand-driven food culture, they will continue to demand more information and accountability about how ingredients are sourced and processed, how real their food products are, and how responsive they are to consumers desire for choice and customization. 
 Regulatory agencies are also playing a larger role in monitoring which food ingredients reach consumers. Beginning in 2018, the FDA banned certain uses of partially hydrogenated oils, the primary artificial source of 
 
1 


  trans fat in processed foods. Following the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, the USDA gained significant oversight of the federal school lunch program and holds the authority to set new, healthier standards for food sold in U.S. schools. These healthier food mandates include minimum serving requirements for fiber, fruits and vegetables and maximum allowable content standards for fat, sugar and sodium. Consumers rising demand for healthier food presents an opportunity for us to provide our innovative solutions for customers and the food industry. 
 Supply Chain 
 We intend to repurpose and leverage supply chain capacity by contracting, tolling or partnering with players in the existing supply chain, which will allow us to apply our resources toward maximizing innovation and product development while minimizing our capital expenditures and overhead. As we continue to streamline our supply chain, we expect to enter into additional contracts and strategic partnerships with participants and members of the value chain, in an effort to maintain control of the process and help ensure product quality, manage cyclical demand and capture value. 
 We believe our product candidates will benefit from being grown, processed and stored utilizing existing third-party infrastructure and standard industry practices that are currently used for non-transgenic products. Our intent is to outsource to third parties, such as seed production companies, farmers, grain storage facilities, soybean crushers and refiners, and wheat millers, for the production and processing of our products in accordance with our stewardship requirements. We do not anticipate using our cash resources to build or purchase processing assets. 
 Our Product Pipeline 
 Our product pipeline is prioritized to include a variety of traits for soybeans, wheat, alfalfa, canola and potatoes. We continue to refine our portfolio and seek to take advantage of the largest market opportunities. We intend to conduct further development programs to build upon our current pipeline. In the future, we may expand our product pipeline to include other crops, whether through collaboration or our own direct commercialization. 
 We categorize our stages of pre-commercial development from Discovery, where we identify genes of interest, to Phase I, where we conduct our gene editing and produce an initial seed with the desired edit, to Phase II, where we perform validation testing, to Phase III, where we develop the first commercial-scale pilot production and begin to build out the supply chain and inventory and perform customer testing prior to commercialization.

 As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of six product candidates in Phase I or higher that have also been deemed non-regulated under the Biotechnology Regulatory Services Am I Regulated? process of APHIS. A summary of these development programs is presented in the table below. In the first quarter of 2019, we successfully completed consultation with FDA for our High Oleic Soybean and we also have multiple projects in the Discovery phase and continue to explore collaboration opportunities for our technologies. 
 

High Oleic Soybean 
 Soybean oil has historically been partially hydrogenated to enhance its oxidative stability in order to increase shelf life and improve frying characteristics. This process, however, creates trans-unsaturated fatty acids, or trans fats, which have been demonstrated to raise low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. High LDL and low HDL have been tied to increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The discovery that dietary trans fats increase the risk of several adverse health issues led the FDA to rule in 2003 that manufacturers must include trans-fat content information on the Nutrition Facts label of foods. In 2015, the FDA banned the addition of partially hydrogenated oils to food products in a phased approach, with the first phase effective June 2018. 
 Monounsaturated fats, such as oleic acid, have been linked to reducing LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raising HDL cholesterols. Diets rich in monounsaturated acids are associated with lower fat mass and decreased blood pressure. High levels of oleic acids can be found in olive, canola, sunflower and safflower oils. 
 We developed a soybean trait that has produced oils with a fatty acid profile that contains 80% oleic acid, 20% less saturated fatty acids compared to commodity soybean oil and zero grams of trans fats per serving. 
 Oil produced from our High Oleic Soybean also has multiple desirable characteristics as an ingredient for the food industry. The high level of oleic acid in our soybean oil enhances oxidative stability compared to commodity oil. This eliminates the need for partial hydrogenation, and thus little to no trans fats are produced during oil production. Furthermore, our High Oleic Soybean Oil offers additional potential benefits, including reduced saturated fats, a threefold increase in fry-life, and reduced polymerization upon frying at high temperatures. Soybean oil is also neutral in flavor, odorless and colorless, and is therefore desired as a food ingredient because it has limited impact on the sensory characteristics of the final food product.

 Plant breeders have developed soybean varieties that are adapted to distinct latitudes and agroclimatic conditionswhich are referred to as maturity groups. We initially introduced our High Oleic Soybean in the northern United States on one variety within a particular maturity group range. Our High Oleic Soybean seed is sold directly to or through distributors to farmers. In 2018 we contracted more than 17,000 acres with nearly 80 growers in South Dakota and Minnesota to grow this High Oleic Soybean. The harvest of these High Oleic Soybean acres has been completed and we have taken delivery of a portion of the harvested crop. We have contracted with third parties to crush and refine our High Oleic Soybean on a commercial scale, enabling sales of High Oleic Soybean Oil and High Oleic Soybean Meal to customers. We commercialized our High Oleic Soybean product candidate in the first quarter of 2019. 
 We intend to launch new High Oleic Soybean varieties in 2020 and 2021. This will enable us to expand to other growing locations, and over time we expect to continue to add to this product portfolio by expanding into early, middle and late maturity groups. We believe this strategy will enable us to expand our supply chain through additional crushing plants within target growing regions and at the same time lower potential premiums and production costs as we introduce into the supply chain additional varieties that meet farmer needs. 
 High Fiber Wheat 
 Fiber is the indigestible portion of food that is essential for healthy digestion. Research has shown that fiber may play a large role in maintaining bowel health, lowering cholesterol, stabilizing blood glucose levels and controlling weight gain. A high fiber diet has the potential to lower the rate of glucose entry into circulation, thus decreasing the risk of food-related chronic diseases, such as coronary artery disease and diabetes. The average American adult consumes approximately 15-18 grams of fiber daily, only half of the amount recommended by the U.S. Department of Healths dietary guidelines based on the average caloric intake. In recent years, the awareness of the health benefits of high fiber diets has increased. This has translated to a strong growth in demand for high fiber food products, with approximately 35% of grocery shoppers now seeking high fiber foods. 
 We are developing our High Fiber Wheat product candidate that could be used to produce white flour with up to three times more dietary fiber than standard white flour while maintaining the same flavor and convenience of use. By altering the proportion of certain slower digested carbohydrates in the wheat grain, we have developed a product candidate that we believe will exhibit increased dietary fiber. This would allow consumers to reach their daily value of fiber without changing their existing food preferences. 
 We believe our High Fiber Wheat flour will able to be incorporated into many food productsfrom pasta to bread. Whereas a single serving of whole wheat flour can provide 49% of an individuals daily fiber needs, a single serving of our High Fiber Wheat flour may provide up to 100% of the recommended daily requirement thereby allowing food manufacturers to make high fiber products sought after by many consumers. 
 This product candidate is currently in Phase II of our development process and is expected to launch as early as 2022. In March 2018 we received confirmation from USDA that our High Fiber Wheat is deemed non-regulated pursuant to APHISs regulatory procedures. In October 2018 we successfully harvested High Fiber Wheat in field trials. In the next year, we intend to further confirm the product concept in field conditions and to complete food application studies. 
 In addition to our High Fiber Wheat product candidate, we are also developing other consumer traits in our wheat pipeline. 
 Our Technology 
 Our gene-editing platform relies on our capacity to custom design DNA-sequence specific cutting enzymes, or nucleases, for any chosen gene we intend to edit and our capability to introduce such custom-made nucleases into 
 
4 


  the living plant cells we want to edit. Our platform also relies on precisely chosen protein families that can specifically recognize unique DNA sequences and can be tailored to target such sequences in any chosen gene or genetic region. 
 Our proprietary technologies and intellectual property portfolio enable us to edit the plant genome by knocking out genes or making precise gene edits. We take advantage of our knowledge about plant gene function to produce novel genetic variation that results in traits of value. A key difference between our gene-edited products and products created through genetic modification (GMO) is that GMOs insert foreign DNA into crops and our gene-editing does not. For each of our product candidates that we submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), USDA confirmed that the product candidates are not regulated articles. This determination decreases our costs and increases our speed to market. 
 Key Advantages of TALEN Technology 
 Our development process deploys our proprietary TALEN technology, which we currently use because of the following benefits: 
 

 | Intellectual propertyWe have a strong intellectual property position with respect to TALEN technology and its use to make our product candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | SpecificityTALEN may be designed to limit its DNA cleavage to the desired sequence and to avoid cutting elsewhere in the genome. This parameter is essential as plant genomes are highly complex; for example, the wheat genome comprises approximately 16 billion base pairs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | PrecisionIt is possible to design a TALEN that will cleave at any selected region in any gene. For example, there are four related FAD genes in the soybean genome. For our High Oleic Soybean, our TALEN edited the two genes that produce fatty acids in the seed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | EfficiencyA large percentage of cells treated by TALEN bear the desired gene edit. Because of TALEN efficiency, only a handful of plants have to be regenerated to recover those with edits in the target gene.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ValidationWe have successfully edited more than 20 unique genes in 6 plant species since our inception in 2010 and can generate thousands of TALEN per week.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Speed to MarketWe can assess the viability of a trait in less than two years and commercialize it in as short as six years with a significantly reduced development cost compared to GMO development processes. Genetically modified products typically require an average of approximately 13 years and costs more than $130 million to develop.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following chart depicts our development process: 
 

The following figure depicts the process, identified in Step 4 in the figure above, of making gene edits using TALEN: 
 

TALEN enable gene-editing by first recognizing a specific DNA sequence and then precisely inducing a controlled DNA double-strand break, which is the key to unlocking gene editing. This break serves as the baseline for a wide range of outcomes, from single nucleotide deletions, to large DNA insertions. The removal of nucleotides (through non-homologous end-joining) can result in gene inactivation or a gene knock-out. If a user-supplied DNA fragment with a similar sequence to the TALEN binding site is provided at the time of the DNA break, then novel information in that DNA fragment is copied into the plant genome (through homologous recombination). We are currently focused on using gene knock-outs and gene repair to develop new traits, which result in a non-transgenic product candidate. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Intellectual property protection is key to our business. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, licensing and filing United States and foreign patent applications on our key intellectual property. We also rely on trade secrets to develop and maintain our proprietary position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, 
 
6 


  trademark, proprietary know-how, continuing technological innovations, trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, material transfer agreements, research agreements, and licensing agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio is composed entirely of patents and patent applications that we have in-licensed from other parties. The majority of these patents and patent applications are licensed through Cellectis. We also have access to additional patents and patent applications through in-licensing agreements with research institutions and universities. 
 We are actively involved in the prosecution and protection of our key technology, which globally includes approximately 40 patent families comprised of over 150 patents and over 140 patent applications. Of those patents, 17 have been issued in the U.S., with the remaining issued in key geographies outside the U.S., primarily Europe, Japan, and China. This number also includes European patents validated in individual European countries. Of our patent applications, 39 are pending in the U.S., with the remanding pending in key geographies outside the U.S. Our core portfolio is directed to: (1) genetic editing of plants using TALEN technology, (2) genetic editing of plants using meganuclease technology, (3) genetic editing of plants using CRISPR technology, and (4) specific plant traits. 
 Individual patent terms extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. The issued patents that we have in-licensed will expire on dates ranging from 2020 to 2033. If patents are issued on the pending patent applications that we have in-licensed, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2023 to 2038. 
 The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Notwithstanding our efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have in-licensed or filed or may in-license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we have in-licensed or patents that may be in-licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and technology. Moreover, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Risk FactorsRisks Related to Intellectual Property. 
 License Agreement with Cellectis 
 Through our license agreement with Cellectis, we have access to intellectual property that broadly covers the use of engineered nucleases for plant gene editing. This intellectual property covers methods to edit plant genes using chimeric restriction endonucleases, which include TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9, zinc finger nucleases, and some types of meganucleases. We believe this umbrella intellectual property applies broadly across gene editing in plants and makes us a key player in the gene editing intellectual property space. 
 Under our license agreement with Cellectis, we have exclusive sublicense rights (subject to existing non-exclusive sublicenses to third parties) to intellectual property exclusively licensed to Cellectis from the University of Minnesota in the field of researching, developing and commercializing agricultural and food products, including traits, seeds, and feed and food ingredients (excluding any application in connection with animals or animal cells). These patent applications cover the use of DNA replicons for gene editing. 
 We have also been granted a non-exclusive license to use the TALEN® trademark in connection with our use of licensed products under the agreement. Any improvements we make to the in-licensed intellectual property is 
 
7 


  owned by us and licensed back to Cellectis on an exclusive basis for any use outside of our exclusive agricultural field of use. The exclusivity of our license agreement with Cellectis is subject to certain non-exclusive licenses Cellectis granted to third parties in the field of research. 
 In consideration for the license from Cellectis, we are required to pay to Cellectis, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, a royalty of 3% of net sales less certain items as defined including costs for grain and seed of any products that are covered by the patents licensed from Cellectis. In addition, we are required to pay Cellectis 30% of revenue we receive for sublicensing our rights under the agreement to third parties. Our payment obligations to Cellectis will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the patents licensed to us by Cellectis. 
 Under our license agreement with Cellectis, and as between the parties, Cellectis has the first right to control the prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of the licensed intellectual property and we will have the right to step in and assume such control with respect to the patents owned by Cellectis and exclusively licensed to us under the agreement if Cellectis elects to not prosecute, maintain, defend or enforce such patents. In certain circumstances, if Cellectis elects to abandon any patents owned by Cellectis and exclusively licensed to us under the agreement, we have the right to assume ownership of such patents. In addition, some of the intellectual property that is licensed to us by Cellectis consists of a sublicense of intellectual property originally licensed to Cellectis by the University of Minnesota. Our license from Cellectis is subject to the license agreement between the University of Minnesota and Cellectis, and should our activities under such sublicense violate the license agreement between Cellectis and the University of Minnesota, we are responsible for any related damages that Cellectis may incur. In addition, we are required to reimburse Cellectis for any payments made by Cellectis to the University of Minnesota pursuant to the license agreement between the University of Minnesota and Cellectis to the extent that such payments are required to be made as a result of our applicable activities. Under the license agreement between Cellectis and the University of Minnesota, the University of Minnesota has the first right to control the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed intellectual property. 
 Our license agreement with Cellectis is perpetual. However, it may be terminated at any time upon the mutual written agreement of both parties, either partys uncured material breach of the agreement, or upon certain bankruptcy and insolvency related events. 
 License Agreement between Cellectis and Regents of the University of MinnesotaTALEN 
 In January 2011, Cellectis entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Minnesota, which was amended in 2012, 2014 and 2015. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, Cellectis and its affiliates were granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license, under certain patents and patent applications owned by the University of Minnesota, to make, use, sell, import and otherwise dispose of products covered by the licensed patents, in all fields of use. These licensed patents relate to TALEN molecules and their use in gene editing. 
 Pursuant to the agreement, with respect to the agricultural field, Cellectis is required to pay to the University of Minnesota a yearly fee, as well as a commercialization fee for every seed variety containing new traits developed using the licensed technology. Cellectis is also required to pay the University of Minnesota milestone payments based on the net sales of licensed products in the agricultural field. Cellectis must also pay the University of Minnesota certain patent-related expenses for prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents; we then reimburse Cellectis for these prosecution costs. 
 The agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents. The University of Minnesota may terminate the agreement upon advance written notice in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Cellectis, and immediately upon written notice in the event that Cellectis challenges the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent in a court or other applicable authority. Cellectis and the University of Minnesota may terminate the agreement by written notice in the event of the other partys breach that has not been cured within a specified number of days after receiving notice of such breach.

 License Agreement between Calyxt and Regents of the University of MinnesotaCRISPR 
 In December 2014, we entered into an exclusive license with the University of Minnesota, pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under a specified patent application and any patents that issue therefrom owned by the University of Minnesota relating to the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to make use, and commercialize products covered by the licensed patents in any field of use. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed technology and to manufacture, offer to sell, and sell licensed products as soon as practicable and to maximize sales. We must also achieve certain sales- and patent-related milestones. 
 Per the terms of the agreement, we paid the University of Minnesota an upfront license fee. We are also required to pay an annual fee, patent-related expenses for prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents, and a percentage of any revenues received by us under sublicenses. If we undergo a change of control and wish to assign all of our rights and duties under the agreement, we must pay the University of Minnesota a specified transfer fee. 
 Unless earlier terminated under the terms of the agreement, the agreement will continue in effect until no licensed patent is active and until no licensed patent application is pending. The University of Minnesota may terminate the agreement for our uncured breach of the agreement upon 90 days prior written notice, or 60 days prior written notice if the breach relates to our payment obligations under the agreement. The University of Minnesota may also terminate the agreement, upon 10 days prior written notice, if we file for bankruptcy or become insolvent. The University of Minnesota may also immediately terminate the agreement if we or our agents or representatives commences or maintains an action in any court or before any governmental agency asserting or alleging the invalidity or unenforceability of the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the agreement for The University of Minnesotas uncured breach of the agreement upon 90 days prior written notice. We may also terminate the agreement at any time upon 60 days prior written notice. 
 Cross-License Agreement with Two Blades Foundation 
 In December 2014, we executed a cross-licensing agreement with Two Blades Foundation relating to transcription factors with modular DNA-binding domains (TAL) nuclease technologies, which was amended in 2016. Pursuant to the agreement, we granted Two Blades Foundation a non-exclusive license to TALEN technology for not-for-profit uses within the field of plants genetically engineered by TAL nuclease, including use in Two Blades Foundations humanitarian efforts to support subsistence farming, and for certain commercial applications related to Two Blades Foundations plant disease resistance programs. The intellectual property licensed to Two Blades Foundation was originally licensed to Cellectis by the University of Minnesota. Under the cross-license, we received a non-exclusive license under Two Blades Foundations TAL Code technology related to nucleases for commercial uses of TAL nucleases in certain specified crop plants. 
 The agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents under the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party, or immediately upon written notice in the event that the other party, or its sublicensees or subcontractors challenges the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent in a court or other applicable authority. Either party may terminate the agreement by written notice in the event of the other partys breach that has not been cured within a specified number of days after receiving notice of such breach. In the event of termination of license agreement between the University of Minnesota and Cellectis with respect to the TALEN technology, our license from Two Blades Foundation will also terminate. 
 Trademarks 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had two pending trademark applications in the United States. In the first quarter of 2019, we filed two additional trademark applications.

 Government Regulation and Product Compliance 
 The United States and the European Union are the two leading jurisdictions, with distinct regulatory regimes applying different rules and requirements. 
 United States 
 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USDA and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are primarily responsible for overseeing agriculture and food regulation and safety, although as many as 15 federal agencies also play a role in U.S. agriculture and food regulation, including several agencies within USDA. Biotechnology is regulated in the United States under the Coordinated Framework for Biotechnology. 
 Our product candidates are not subject to regulatory review by the EPA. Other biotechnology products are subject to EPA regulatory review. As the EPA, USDA, and FDA consider the Coordinated Framework for Biotechnology, it is possible we could become subject to EPA regulatory review in the future. If that were to occur, it could impact our business. 
 The USDA has regulatory jurisdiction over transgenic crops through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Under the Plant Protection Act, USDA requires anyone who wishes to import, transport interstate, or plant a regulated article to apply for a permit or notify APHIS that the introduction will be made. Regulated articles are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 7 CFR Part 340.1 as any organism which has been altered or produced through genetic engineering which USDA determines is a plant pest or has reason to believe is a plant pest. The petition process to enable product commercialization can be a multi-year process that varies based on a number of factors, including APHIS familiarity with similar products, the type and scope of the environmental review conducted, and the number and types of public comments received. APHIS conducts a comprehensive science-based review of the petition to assess, among other things, plant pest risk, environmental considerations pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA, and any potential impact on endangered species. If, upon the completion of the review, APHIS grants the petition, the product is no longer deemed a regulated article and the petitioner may commercialize the product, subject to any conditions set forth in the decision. If APHIS does not determine the product to be non-regulated, the product may be subject to extensive regulation, including permitting requirements for import, handling, interstate movement, release into the environment, and inspections. 
 We submitted petitions to APHIS for six of our current product candidates including our High Oleic Soybean and High Fiber Wheat. We received confirmation from APHIS for all six product candidates that APHIS does not consider any of our product candidates to be regulated articles under the Plant Protection Act. There can be no guarantee of the timing or success in obtaining nonregulated status from APHIS for our other crops or that the governing regulations will not change. USDA is considering revisions to its rules governing biotechnology, which could negatively impact our business, including increasing our regulatory burden or providing uncertainty for the launch of our product candidates. 
 The FDA has jurisdiction to regulate more than 80 percent of the U.S. food supply. It derives its regulatory power from the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, which has been amended over time by several subsequent laws. The FDAs oversight of food safety and security is primarily carried out by its Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. To execute its responsibilities, the FDA employs a team of more than 900 investigators and 450 analysts in the foods program who conduct inspections and collect and analyze product samples. The FDA typically does not perform pre-market inspection for foods. The FDA also regulates ingredients, packaging, and labeling of foods, including nutrition and health claims and the nutrition facts panel. Foods are typically not subject to premarket review and approval requirements, with limited exceptions. 
 The FDA regulates foods made with GMOs under its 1992 Statement of Policy: Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties. Under this policy, the FDA regulates foods derived from genetically modified plant varieties consistent 
 
10 


  with the framework for non-genetically modified foods. Under Section 409 of the FDCA, any substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food is considered a food additive that is subject to premarket approval by the FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Companies are responsible for making an initial determination of whether a food substance falls under an existing food additive regulation, requires a new food additive petition, or is GRAS. A company may market a new food ingredient based on its independent determination that the substance is GRAS; however, the FDA can disagree and take enforcement action. The FDA offers a voluntary consultation process to determine whether foods derived from genetically modified plant varieties will be subject to these more stringent regulatory requirements. Developers routinely consult with the FDA prior to marketing and, in most cases, foods derived from genetically modified plant varieties are not subjected to premarket review and approval processes. 
 Calyxt has completed voluntary consultation with the FDA for our High Oleic Soybean. After review, the FDA had no further questions concerning human food ingredients or animal food derived Calyxts High Oleic Soybean. 
 The FDA is currently evaluating its approach to the regulation of gene-edited plants. The FDAs thinking on the use of genome editing techniques to produce new plant varieties that are used for human or animal food continues to evolve. To that end, in January 2017 the FDA announced a Request for Comments (RFC) seeking public input to help inform its thinking about human and animal foods derived from new plant varieties produced using genome editing techniques. Among other things, the RFC asks for data and information in response to questions about the safety of foods from gene-edited plants, such as whether categories of gene-edited plants present food safety risks different from other plants produced through traditional plant breeding. If the FDA enacts new regulations or policies with respect to gene-edited plants, such policies could result in additional compliance costs and/or delay the commercialization of our product candidates. 
 European Union 
 In the European Union (the EU), genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and genetically modified food and feed products can only be sold in the market once they have been properly authorized. The procedures for evaluation and authorization of GMOs and genetically modified food and feed products are established by Regulation (EC) 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed and Directive 2001/18/EC on the release of GMOs into the environment. An application for authorization must be submitted under Directive 2001/18/EC if a company seeks to release GMOs for experimental purposes (e.g., field tests) and/or to sell GMOs, as such or in products, in the market (e.g., cultivation, importation or processing). In turn, an application for authorization must be submitted under Regulation (EC) 1829/2003 if a company seeks to sell GMOs in the market for food and feed use and/or food and feed products containing or produced from GMOs. At the national level, EU member states have the ability to restrict or prohibit GMO cultivation in their territories by invoking grounds such as environmental or agricultural policy objectives, town and country-planning, land use, coexistence, socio-economic impacts or public policy. 
 In addition, Directive 2001/18/EC, Regulation (EC) 1829/2003 and Regulation (EC) 1830/2003 establish specific labeling and traceability requirements for GMOs and products that contain or are produced from GMOs. Finally, Directives 2002/53/EC and 2002/55/EC require genetically modified varieties to be authorized before they can be included in a Common Catalogue of Varieties, which would permit the seeds of such genetically modified varieties to be marketed in the EU. 
 A recent ruling of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in July 2018 clarified that only mutagenesis techniques which (a) have been used in a number of applications and (b) have a long safety record, can be exempted from these requirements. EU member states remain free to subject even such exempted organisms to the obligations under Directive 2001/18/EC, or to other obligations. The impact of this ruling on, and the ultimate treatment by the EU of, products produced using other advanced plant breeding techniques is not yet known and the final determination could have a negative impact on our business.

 Competition 
 The market for agricultural biotechnology products is highly competitive, and we face significant direct and indirect competition in several aspects of our business. Competition for improving plant genetics comes from conventional and advanced plant breeding techniques, as well as from the development of genetically modified traits. Other potentially competitive sources of improvement in crop yields include improvements in crop protection chemicals, fertilizer formulations, farm mechanization, other biotechnology, and information management. Programs to improve genetics and chemistry are generally concentrated within a relatively small number of large companies, while non-genetic approaches are underway with broader set of companies. Additionally, competition for providing more nutritious ingredients for food companies come from chemical-based ingredients, additives and substitutes, which are developed by various companies. 
 In general, we believe that we face competition from both large agricultural biotechnology, seed and chemical companies, certain of which have been actively involved in new trait discovery, development, and commercialization, and from specialty food ingredient companies, which are generally focused on providing solutions to the food industry through chemical, synthetic or other methods. Many of our competitorsparticularly large chemical companieshave substantially larger budgets for research, development (R&D), product commercialization and regulatory process management than we do. Because of the breadth of the development programs of our competitors, it is possible that some of our competitors may in the future be our partners in certain projects. 
 We also face indirect competition from trait research and development companies as well as agricultural research universities and institutions. Given the global importance of agriculture, there are a number of companies, research universities and institutions that specialize in R&D of agricultural yield and product quality traits. Because these indirect competitors typically focus on a limited number of traits and do not generally have the product development, gene-editing technologies and regulatory infrastructure necessary to bring traits to market, they generally out-license trait technologies to large industry players with in-house development and regulatory capabilities at a relatively early stage of development. 
 We believe that the primary competitive factors in the seed industry are product development, product quality, performance, scale, price, and compliance with food safety standards. We believe that we are able to compete favorably based on the basis of our expertise and the precision, specificity, cost effectiveness and development speed of our proprietary technologies. Nevertheless, many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their R&D or collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in R&D, manufacturing, testing and marketing approved products than we do. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products faster, with lower research costs or with more desirable traits than we can. 
 Research and Development 
 Our R&D team has technical expertise in genome engineering, molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics and genetic engineering, plant physiology and plant breeding. Our R&D activities are conducted principally at our Minnesota facilities and we also conduct breeding activities through third parties in the U.S., its territories and South America. We have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in R&D. We incurred R&D expenses of $9.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, $11.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, and $5.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 50 employees, 28 of whom are in R&D. Our multidisciplinary team includes experts in biology, chemistry, plant genetics, agronomics, data scientists, and other related fields. As
