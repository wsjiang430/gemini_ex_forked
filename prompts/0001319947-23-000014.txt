ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
Designer Brands Inc., originally founded as DSW Inc., is one of the world's largest designers, producers, and retailers of footwear and accessories. We operate in three reportable segments: the U.S. Retail segment, the Canada Retail segment, and the Brand Portfolio segment. The U.S. Retail segment operates the DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse ("DSW") banner through its direct-to-consumer U.S. stores and e-commerce site. The Canada Retail segment operates The Shoe Company and DSW banners through its direct-to-consumer Canada stores and e-commerce sites. Together, the U.S. Retail and Canada Retail segments are referred to as the "retail segments." The Brand Portfolio segment earns revenue from the wholesale of products to retailers and international distributors, commissions for serving retailers as the design and buying agent for products under private labels (referred to as "First Cost"), and the sale of branded products through our direct-to-consumer e-commerce sites at www.vincecamuto.com and www.topoathletic.com.
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. References to a fiscal year (e.g., "2022") refer to the calendar year in which the fiscal year begins. This reporting schedule is followed by many national retail companies and typically results in a 52-week fiscal year, but occasionally will contain an additional week resulting in a 53-week fiscal year (including 2023). 
RETAIL SEGMENTS
BANNERS
We offer a wide assortment of dress, casual, and athletic footwear and accessories for women, men and kids, with a significant number of our products geared toward athletic and kids.
•DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse- Our DSW banner, which is offered both in the United States ("U.S.") and in Canada, is the destination for on-trend and fashion-forward footwear and accessory brands at a great value every single day, offering a wide assortment of dress, casual, and athletic footwear and accessories for women, men and kids. 
•The Shoe Company- The Shoe Company banner in Canada offers on-trend footwear and accessory brands that target every-day family styles at a great value every single day. 
Our e-commerce platforms offer customers convenient, 24/7 access to our products through our websites, www.dsw.com, www.dsw.ca, and www.theshoecompany.ca, with mobile-optimized sites, and our mobile DSW application. Our omni-channel capabilities allow customers to order a wide range of styles, sizes, widths and categories. Online orders in the U.S. and Canada can be fulfilled from any one of our stores. Online orders from the U.S. can also be fulfilled from our distribution center located in New Jersey, which is a shared facility with the Brand Portfolio segment ("East Coast Logistics Center"), or directly from our vendors (referred to as "drop ship"). Our order routing optimization system determines the best location to fulfill digitally-demanded products, which allows us to optimize our operating profit. To further meet customer demand of how they receive products, we provide our customers options to Buy Online Pick Up in Store, Buy Online Ship to Store, and Curbside Pickup in the majority of our locations. Likewise, returns may be shipped to us or brought back to any of our locations.
ASSORTMENT
We sell a large assortment of national brands and brands we have rights to sell through ownership or license arrangements, which we refer to as "Owned Brands." During 2022, we made progress in our long-term goal of doubling the net sales from our Owned Brands by 2026 (using 2021 net sales as a baseline), while maintaining our net sales from national brands. We expect this long-term goal will result in approximately one-third of our total net sales coming from Owned Brands by 2026. We believe that increasing net sales from our Owned Brands products will not only drive growth and expand our gross margin, but will also elevate our presence as a brand builder. In addition to disaggregating our net sales between Owned Brands and national brands, we disaggregate our net sales into four primary categories: women's footwear, men's footwear, kids' footwear, and accessories and other. Refer to Note 3, Revenue, of the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K, for the disaggregation of total net sales.

DISTRIBUTION AND FULFILLMENT
For our U.S. Retail segment operations, the majority of our inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our distribution center, which is located in Columbus, Ohio, and a West Coast facility that is operated by a third party, where the inventory is then processed, sorted, and shipped to one of our pool locations located throughout the country, and then on to the stores. Our inventory can also be shipped directly to our customers from our East Coast Logistics Center. For our Canada Retail segment, we engage a logistics service provider to receive and distribute inventory to our stores. Through our ship-from-store capability, both in the U.S. and in Canada, inventory is shipped directly from our stores to customers. Through our U.S. drop ship program, inventory is shipped from our vendors' warehouses directly to our customers.
Inventory management is important to our business, we manage our inventory levels based on anticipated sales and the delivery requirements of our customers. Our inventory management strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand, while improving our efficiency over the long term by enhancing systems and processes.
BRAND PORTFOLIO SEGMENT
Our Brand Portfolio segment designs, develops, and sources in-season fashion footwear and accessories for the sale of wholesale merchandise to our retail segments and our other retailer customers. Our First Cost model earns commission-based income for serving retailers as their design and buying agent, while leveraging our overall design and sourcing infrastructure. In addition, we sell our branded products on a direct-to-consumer e-commerce site at www.vincecamuto.com. Refer to Note 3, Revenue, of the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K, for the Brand Portfolio segment's total net sales attributable to each channel. The Brand Portfolio segment has four customers that make up approximately 53% of its total net sales, excluding intersegment net sales. The loss of any or all of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Brand Portfolio segment.

LICENSING RIGHTS
Our equity investments in ABG-Camuto, LLC ("ABG-Camuto") and Le Tigre 360 Global LLC ("Le Tigre") are an integral part of the Brand Portfolio segment. In partnership with Authentic Brands Group LLC, a global brand management and marketing company, we have a 40% ownership interest in ABG-Camuto, a joint venture that owns the intellectual property rights of Vince Camuto and others. ABG-Camuto is responsible for the growth and marketing of the brands held by the joint venture. We have entered into a licensing agreement with ABG-Camuto, whereby we pay royalties to ABG-Camuto based on the sales of licensed products, subject to guaranteed minimums. ABG-Camuto also earns royalties on sales from third parties that license the brand names to produce non-footwear product categories. In July 2022, we acquired a 33.3% ownership interest in Le Tigre, which manages the Le Tigre brand, for $8.2 million. We entered into a license agreement with Le Tigre, whereby we pay royalties on our net sales from the Le Tigre brand, subject to guaranteed minimums. The license agreement provides for the exclusive right to design, source, and sell Le Tigre branded footwear. We recognize equity investments and earnings under the equity method within the Brand Portfolio segment. In addition, we own the licensing rights for footwear of the Jessica Simpson brand and for footwear and handbags of the Lucky Brand. 
SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION
We source each of our product lines based on the individual design, style and quality specifications of the products. Our Brand Portfolio segment does not own or operate manufacturing facilities; rather, we use our sourcing offices in China and Brazil to procure our products from third-party manufacturers. Prior to production, our sourcing offices inspect samples and prototypes of each style and monitor the quality of the production process. We manage our inventory levels based on existing orders and anticipated sales. 
The manufacturers of our products are required to meet our quality, human rights, local compliance, safety, and other standard requirements. These vendors are expected to respect local laws, rules, and regulations of the countries in which they operate and have pledged to follow the standards set forth in the Company's Vendor Code of Conduct, which details our dedication to human rights, labor rights, environmental responsibility, and workplace safety. The majority of our wholesale inventory is shipped directly from factories in foreign countries to our East Coast Logistics Center, where the inventory is then processed, sorted, and provided to our customers' shipping carriers.
The following table presents the percentages of the Brand Portfolio segment's merchandise units sourced by country: 

 | 2022 | | 2021
China | 76 | % | | 75 | %
Vietnam | 9 | % | | 9 | %
Brazil | 9 | % | | 11 | %
All other foreign locations | 6 | % | | 5 | %

ACQUISITIONS
On December 13, 2022, we acquired a 79.4% ownership interest in Topo Athletic LLC ("Topo") for $19.1 million. Topo is a designer of specialty athletic footwear that sells its Topo branded products at wholesale to retailers and international distributors and through its direct-to-consumer e-commerce site at www.topoathletic.com. The Topo acquisition provides us with expanded capabilities within the athletic footwear market.
On February 4, 2023, we acquired the Keds business, including the Keds brand, inventory, and inventory-related accounts payable, from Wolverine World Wide, Inc. for $123.3 million. The Keds business designs, sources, and sells branded footwear and earns revenue from the wholesale of products to retailers in the U.S. and Canada, the wholesale of products to international distributors, and the sale of branded products through direct-to-consumer e-commerce sites in the U.S. and Canada. We will account for the acquisition and include the results of the Keds business in our Brand Portfolio segment beginning with our first quarter of 2023. 
COMPETITION
The footwear market is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group of manufacturers and retailers, including department stores, mall-based shoe stores, national chains, independent shoe retailers, single-brand specialty retailers, online shoe retailers, brand-oriented discounters, multi-channel specialty retailers, and brand suppliers. In addition, our wholesale retailer customers sell shoes purchased from competing footwear suppliers with brands that are well known.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER TRANSITION
In January 2023, we announced our planned succession process relating to the Company's CEO role, whereby our current CEO, Roger Rawlins, will step down from his role as CEO and as a member of the Board of Directors effective April 1, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by the Board of Directors, at which time Doug Howe, who currently serves as Executive Vice President of the Company and President of DSW, will assume the CEO role and join the Board of Directors as a Class II director. To assist in facilitating a smooth transition, Mr. Rawlins will remain employed under the terms of a transition and consulting agreement through April 1, 2023 and, for the 12-month period thereafter, will serve as a strategic advisor to the Company and the Board of Directors.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
We believe the strength of our workforce is critical to our success. Our associates strive every day to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for themselves and our customers. One of our core strategies is to invest in and support our associates who are key to differentiating our products and experiences in the competitive footwear market. We monitor and adapt as necessary to maintain our competitive position, including the following areas of focus:
WORKFORCE
Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, develop, advance, and retain the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, our human resources programs aim to:

TOTAL REWARDS
To remain an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we continually assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation practices, benefit programs, and other associate resources.

The policy was deemed to no longer be necessary in October 2022; however, we continue to follow all applicable COVID-19 local paid leave regulations.

A wide variety of resources are designed to address the needs of our entire workforce, from entry-level associates to our most senior executives. During 2022, 11,500 associates completed approximately 100,000 learning experiences through our online learning platform. We invest resources in professional development and growth as a means of improving associate performance, engagement, and retention. We believe that our continued focus on frequent and constructive performance feedback, talent reviews, succession planning, and retention, have contributed to a strong internal promotion rate.
PHILANTHROPY THROUGH DBI GIVES
The Company is committed to good corporate citizenship. Not only do we strive to create positive impacts within our organization, but we aim to better the communities in which we conduct business through DBI Gives, our philanthropic community interest group. DBI Gives' mission is to inspire community involvement and enhance associate engagement and has three main areas of focus:
1.Empowerment- Support organizations that prioritize empowerment and build self-confidence without discrimination.
2.Diversity, Equity & Inclusion- Support organizations whose key constituents align with the diversity dimensions represented by our Business Resource Groups ("BRGs").
3.Community- As the places where our associates live and work mean everything to us, we support the organizations that put our local communities first and provide opportunities for our associates to give back through volunteering and donations.
DBI Gives has three primary areas of partnership: 
1.Soles4Souls- Soles4Souls creates sustainable jobs and provides relief through the distribution of shoes and clothing around the world, while giving shoes and garments a second life and keeping them out of landfills. Since partnering with Soles4Souls in 2018, we are proud to have donated over 7 million pairs of shoes, including 1.6 million pairs donated in 2022. In 2022, we focused our register donation efforts to support Soles4Souls, generating over $600,000 in customer-funded donations. 
2.Two Ten Footwear Foundation- Two Ten provides scholarships and financial aid to people working in the footwear industry, as well as free counseling and community resources. Many of our own associates have been beneficiaries of Two Ten's programs. We support Two Ten with corporate financial donations and subject matter expertise to continue to enrich their community program offerings.
3.Hometown Partnerships- From annual United Way fundraisers, American Red Cross blood drives, local nonprofit partnerships, and associate volunteering efforts, we always look for ways to support and better the communities in which we operate. During the 2022 holiday season, with the cost of food on the rise, our associates helped address hunger and food insecurity by collecting and donating food items to their local food banks and packing meals for those in need. Altogether, our associates collected/packed over 74,000 meals.
DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION ("DE&I") 
We support diversity, equity, and inclusion and believe that:
•diversity is the celebration of the ways we are alike and different, as well as unique;
•equity compels us to be fair, while also recognizing the need to treat others differently to mitigate the risk of inadvertently perpetuating systemic barriers; and
•inclusion is the act of ensuring our differences are welcomed, valued, respected, and heard.
We strive to inspire self-expression, authenticity, and empowerment to drive the best possible experiences for our associates, customers, and communities in alignment with our business objectives. Formal ways for associates, on a voluntary basis, to get involved include: 
•BRGs, which are associate-led groups organized around a common diversity dimension to foster an inclusive, engaging work environment for all. 
•Community Interest Groups ("CIGs"), which are associate-led groups based on a common passion or interest to drive a sense of community and shared purpose. 
•Councils, which are associate-led groups organized to create a sense of inclusion and belonging for those who work in our stores, distribution centers, and fulfillment center. 
All groups are inclusive and open to any associate who wants to join. Associates can be members of as many groups as they want. Our BRGs, CIGs, and Councils provide a unique strategic perspective based on shared experience, background, and allyship, while promoting diversity in our workplace and community in alignment with our business goals. 
Our DE&I principles are also reflected in our associate training programs, which address our policies against harassment, bullying, and bias in the workplace. We strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce. As of January 28, 2023, nearly 79% of our U.S. based associates self-identified as female and over 55% of our U.S. associate population self-identified as people of color. Additionally, as of the end of 2022, 36% of the Company's Board of Directors and 46% of executives in vice president and above positions self-identified as female.
Mr. Rawlins, Designer Brands' current CEO, is a proud signatory of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. This demonstrates our top-down approach to furthering our goals of cultivating open dialogue, expanding diversity training, sharing best practices with other companies, and engaging our Board of Directors in the evaluation of our progress. For the fourth consecutive year, Designer Brands has been recognized for its LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts with a 100 score on the Human Rights Campaign's ("HRC") Corporate Equality Index, which places us on HRC's "Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality" list. Designer Brands has also been recognized by Forbes as one of "The Best Employers for Diversity," "The World's Best Employers" and "The World's Top Female-Friendly Companies."
In 2022, Designer Brands announced an investment of $2.0 million into advancing action-oriented DE&I through a partnership with Pensole and legendary footwear designer Dr. D'Wayne Edwards, President of Pensole Lewis College of Business & Design ("PLC"). Located in Detroit, PLC is the first and only Historically Black College & University ("HBCU") in Michigan and the first HBCU with a focus on design. In this new partnership, Designer Brands invested in the first Black-owned footwear factory in the U.S. – JEMS by Pensole – to produce shoes designed by PLC graduate students, to be sold exclusively at DSW. Together with Pensole, we will provide designers with opportunities to offer new products directly to consumers. Ultimately, the partnership is aimed at creating careers and investing in diverse, talented, aspiring designers to become the future of our industry.
We believe that paying our people fairly, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, or any other status, enables us to deliver on our goal of creating an inclusive environment where we can all be ourselves, contribute ideas and do our best work. To this end, we have invested in pay equity processes that allow us to assess whether associates with similar roles and experience earn equal pay for comparable work. Based on our belief that equality and diversity makes our organization stronger, we continue to focus on and invest in pay equity processes. 
We are on a journey to promote greater levels of DE&I in everything we do and recognize that there is still a long way to go. We will continue to challenge our own biases, engage in difficult conversations in meaningful ways, foster diverse perspectives to drive innovation, and intentionally evolve our operating strategies to advance this important work.
ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT
We provide all associates with the opportunity to share their opinions and feedback on their employment experience through engagement surveys performed on a regular basis across all business segments. Results of the surveys are measured and analyzed with a goal of enhancing the associate experience, strengthening engagement and retention, and driving change. In addition to Company-led surveys, leaders are encouraged to conduct "skip level" touch bases, host round table chats, and conduct follow-up activities to better understand associate feedback. We are embracing a flexible work environment by rolling out the option for our corporate associates to work where they choose to, whether that be in the office, at home or elsewhere, to best meet their individual needs. Upon exiting the Company, associates who voluntarily leave the business are provided an exit survey to help us measure satisfaction and engagement and identify the factors that may have contributed to pursuing another opportunity. We continue to develop opportunities for associate connection and engagement in the evolving workplace environment by listening to our associates and taking actions on what is most important and impactful to them.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
Our business activities are global and subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. For example, substantially all of our import operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws, regulations, and tax requirements, such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or unilateral actions. In addition, the countries where our products are manufactured or imported from may from time to time impose additional duties, tariffs, or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and competitive position. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We have registered a number of trademarks, service marks, and domain names in the U.S., Canada, and internationally, including DSW®, DSW Shoe Warehouse®, and DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse®. We also have a 40% interest in ABG-Camuto, which holds the intellectual property rights of Vince Camuto® and others. ABG-Camuto licenses to us the rights to certain of its trademarks in specific categories, such as footwear and handbags, which, as of January 28, 2023, have six years remaining on the initial license term and are indefinitely renewable on five-year terms. We believe our trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to building our name recognition. 
SEASONALITY
Our business consists of two principal selling seasons: the spring season, which includes the first and second fiscal quarters, and the fall season, which includes the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Historically, net sales have been slightly higher in the fall season than in the spring season; however, during 2022, net sales in the fall season were slightly lower than the spring season due to the decline in overall global economic conditions and unseasonably warm weather. Our seasonal results of operations may fluctuate based on global economic conditions, changes in weather conditions, and our customers' interest in new seasonal styles.
