 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are an independent investment management firm operating a next generation, integrated multi‑boutique model with $52.8 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2018. Our differentiated model features a scalable operating platform that provides centralized distribution, marketing and operations infrastructure to our Franchises and Solutions Platform. As of December 31, 2018, our Franchises and our Solutions Platform collectively managed a diversified set of 71 investment strategies for a wide range of institutional and retail clients.

 Our Franchises are operationally integrated but are separately branded and make investment decisions independently from one another within guidelines established by their respective investment mandates that we monitor. Our integrated multi‑boutique model creates a supportive environment in which our investment professionals, largely unencumbered by administrative and operational responsibilities, can focus on their pursuit of investment excellence. VCM employs all of our U.S. investment professionals across our Franchises, which are not separate legal entities.
 Our Solutions Platform consists of multi‑Franchise and customized solutions strategies that are primarily rules‑based. We offer our Solutions Platform through a variety of vehicles, including separate accounts, mutual funds and VictoryShares which is our ETF brand. Like our Franchises, our Solutions Platform is operationally integrated and supported by our centralized distribution, marketing and operational support functions.
 Our centralized key functions include distribution, marketing, trading, middle‑ and back‑office administration, legal, compliance and finance. Our integrated model aims to “centralize, not standardize.” We believe by providing our Franchises with control over their portfolio management tools, risk analytics and other investment‑related functions, we can minimize disruptions to their investment process and ensure that they are able to invest in the fashion that they find most optimal.
 In addition to our integrated multi‑boutique business model, we believe there are four main attributes that differentiate us from other publicly traded investment management firms:

· | We have constructed a set of distinct investment approaches in specialized asset classes where we believe active managers are well positioned to generate alpha over a full market cycle through security selection and portfolio construction. We believe our strategies in these specialized asset classes, which we refer to as our current focus asset classes, will drive our future growth. These strategies have experienced less fee compression than strategies in more commoditized asset classes, and we believe demand for them typically exceeds capacity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We have a track record of successfully sourcing, executing and integrating sizable acquisitions and making these acquisitions financially attractive by extracting significant synergies as a result of integrating the acquired entity onto our operating platform. In addition, we have been able to expand the distribution for the products of the acquired entities through our centralized distribution platform. Our recently announced acquisitions of Harvest and the USAA Acquired Companies are evidence of the appeal of our differentiated platform, combining scale and boutique qualities, making us an attractive acquirer to firms looking for a strategic partner. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We have a diversified business that offers a suite of active products and hybrid rules‑based products through our proprietary ETF brand, VictoryShares, across a wide range of asset classes and distinct investment approaches, to a broad and diverse group of institutional and retail clients. We offer our 71 investment strategies through nine Franchises and our Solutions Platform, with no Franchise accounting for more than 34% of total AUM as of December 31, 2018. Each of our Franchises employs a different investment approach, which we believe leads to diversification in investment return streams among Franchises, even when asset classes overlap. These factors also mitigate key man risk.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We foster a culture that encourages long‑term thinking through promoting meaningful employee ownership. We have a high degree of employee ownership, with approximately 82% of our employees beneficially owning approximately 27% of our shares as of December 31, 2018. Many of such employees have purchased their equity interests in our firm. In addition, as of December 31, 2018 our current and former employees have collectively invested approximately $100 million in products we manage, directly aligning their investment outcomes with those of our clients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Since our management‑led buyout with Crestview GP from KeyCorp in August 2013, we have completed three acquisitions and a strategic minority investment and grown our AUM from $17.9 billion to $52.8 billion as of 

 
  8

 
December 31, 2018. In addition, in the third quarter of 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase Harvest and, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase the USAA Acquired Companies. We regularly evaluate potential acquisition candidates and maintain a strong network of industry participants and advisors that provide opportunities to establish potential target relationships and source transactions. Our management leads and participates in our acquisition strategy, leveraging their many years of experience actively operating our Company on a day‑to‑day basis towards successfully sourcing, executing and integrating acquisitions. We continue to seek to make acquisitions that will add high quality investment teams, that enhance our growth and financial profile, improve our diversification by asset class and investment strategy, achieve our integration and synergy expectations, expand our distribution capabilities and optimize our operating platform.
 We believe, based on our acquisition experience, that there is a significant opportunity for us to grow through additional acquisitions. We believe the universe of potential acquisition targets has grown as a result of the evolution of the distribution landscape, the increasing cost of regulatory compliance, management fee compression and outflows from actively managed funds to passive products. In the United States, as of November 30, 2018, investment management firms with up to $100 billion of AUM collectively manage approximately $9.0 trillion total AUM. We intend to primarily focus our acquisition efforts on firms with $10 billion to $75 billion in AUM, a size range in which we have successfully executed two transactions (the Munder Acquisition and the RS Acquisition), announced two additional transactions (Harvest and the USAA Acquired Companies) and in which investment management firms in the United States collectively manage approximately $5.7 trillion of AUM. We would consider firms both below and above this AUM range should they provide a compelling opportunity.
 Through our acquisitions to date, we have added Franchises we believe can outperform the market, and where we have a strong understanding of the core business’s ability to drive growth for those Franchises and our Company as a whole. These acquisitions have shifted our AUM mix from 38% in our current focus asset classes at the time of our management‑led buyout in 2013 to 78% in our current focus asset classes as of December 31, 2018. We believe our deliberate repositioning of our business through acquisitions has equipped us with stronger investment strategies in more compelling asset classes, providing us with a next generation investment management platform.

     We offer our clients an array of equity and fixed income strategies that encompass a diverse spectrum of market capitalization segments, investment styles and approaches. Our current focus asset classes—which consist of U.S. small‑ and mid‑cap equities, global/non‑U.S. equities and solutions—collectively comprised 78% of our AUM as of December 31, 2018. We believe strategies in these asset classes are better positioned to attract positive net flows and maintain stable fee rates over the long term. As of December 31, 2018, we estimate we had approximately $105 billion of total excess capacity in our four‑ and five‑star funds in these asset classes that were open to new investors (of which approximately $67 billion is in our Solutions Platform).

 As outlined below, our business is diversified on multiple fronts, including by business, Franchise and Solutions Platform, client type and investment vehicle.

Within individual asset classes, our Franchises employ different investment approaches. This diversification reduces the correlation between return streams generated by multiple Franchises investing within the same asset class. For example, we have several Franchises focused on Emerging Markets within global/non‑U.S. equity, each with a different investment approach. Trivalent’s investment team is one of the longest industry practitioners of small cap investing and primarily focuses on quantitative analysis for stock selection. Sophus employs a front‑end quantitative screen balanced to first rank stocks, then further applies fundamental research to make investment decisions. Due to the differences in

investment approaches, each Franchise has a different return profile for investors in different market environments while having exposure to their desired asset classes.

  Our multi‑channel distribution capabilities provide another degree of diversification, with approximately 56% of our AUM from institutional clients and 44% from retail clients as of December 31, 2018. We believe this client diversification has a stabilizing effect on our revenue, as institutional and retail investors have shown to exhibit different demand patterns and respond to trends in different ways.
 We believe we have created a strong alignment of interests with clients and shareholders through employee ownership, our Franchise revenue share structure and employee investments in Victory products. Notably, the majority of our employee shareholders acquired their equity in connection with the management‑led buyout with Crestview GP from KeyCorp, as well as in connection with the Munder Acquisition and the RS Acquisition. We believe the opportunity to own equity in a well‑diversified company is attractive, both to existing employees and those who join as part of acquisitions. We principally compensate our investment professionals through a revenue share program, which we believe further incentivizes our investment professionals to focus on investment performance, while simultaneously minimizing potential distractions from the expense allocation process that would be involved in a profit‑sharing program. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, our current and former employees collectively have invested approximately $100 million in products we manage, directly aligning their investment outcomes with those of our clients. We believe the combination of these mechanisms has promoted long‑term thinking, an enhanced client experience and ultimately the creation of value for our shareholders.

 Our senior management team has an average of over 26 years of experience in the industry, each bringing significant expertise to his or her role. Our Chief Executive Officer and President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer have been with us (and our predecessor) for 14.5 and 13 years, respectively, overseeing the transformation of the business from a bank subsidiary to an independent investment management firm. Our Franchises’ CIOs are highly experienced, having an average of approximately 27 years of experience. Our sales leaders have had significant tenures, with an average of approximately 29 years of experience with us or a predecessor firm.
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe we have significant competitive strengths that position us for sustained growth over the long term.
 Integrated Multi‑Boutique Model Providing Investment Autonomy, Centralized Distribution, Marketing and Support Functions to Investment Franchises
 We believe our integrated multi‑boutique model allows us to achieve the benefits from both the scale of large managers and the focus of smaller managers. Our Franchises retain investment autonomy while benefiting from our centralized middle‑ and back‑office functions. We have demonstrated an ability to integrate our Franchises onto our flexible infrastructure without significantly increasing incremental fixed costs, which is a key component to the scalability of our model. Our structure enables our Franchises to focus their efforts on the investment process, providing them the platform to enhance their investment performance and consequently their growth prospects. Our centralized operations allow our Franchises to customize their desired investment support functions in ways that are best suited for their investment workflow. Through our centralized distribution platform, our Franchises are able to sell their products to institutional investors, retirement plans, brokerages and wealth managers to which it is challenging for smaller managers to gain access.
 Within our model, each Franchise retains its own brand and logo, which it has built over time. Unlike other models with unified branding, there is no requirement for newly acquired Franchises to adjust their product set due to pre‑existing products on our platform; they are simply marketed under their own brand as they were previously. Because of this dynamic, we have the flexibility to add new Franchises either to gain greater exposure to certain asset classes or increase capacity in places where we already have exposure.
 Proven Acquirer with Compelling Proposition
 We believe our platform will allow us to continue to be a consolidator within the investment management industry, providing us with an opportunity to further grow and scale our business. Through several transactions, we have demonstrated an ability to successfully source, execute and integrate new Franchises.
 We believe our integrated multi‑boutique model is compelling for potential Franchises with entrepreneurial leaders. Under our model, Franchises retain the brands they have built as well as autonomy over their investment decisions, while simultaneously benefiting from the ability to leverage our centralized distribution, marketing and operations platform. Our model further relieves our Franchises of much of their administrative burdens and allows them instead to focus on the investment process, which we believe provides them a platform to enhance their performance. By offering a platform on which Franchises can focus on their core competencies, grow their own brand faster and participate in a revenue share program, we believe we are providing an attractive proposition. Furthermore, we believe Victory equity is attractive to Franchise investment personnel, as these personnel receive the advantage of sharing in the potential upside of the entirety of our diversified investment management business.

Because we integrate a significant portion of each Franchise’s distribution, operational and administrative functions, we have been able to extract significant expense synergies from our acquisitions, enabling us to create greater value from transactions. As of December 31, 2018, we had generated net annualized expense synergies of approximately $76 million from our three acquisitions. For example, in the acquisition of RS Investments which closed in 2016, we successfully achieved net annual expense synergies of $53 million, which represents over 45% of RS Investments’ expenses in the year prior to the acquisition. We incurred $9.9 million in total one‑time expenses to achieve those synergies.

 As evidenced by the announcements to acquire Harvest and the USAA Acquired Companies, we will seek to continue to augment our next generation investment management platform by focusing on acquisition candidates that provide investment capabilities that are complementary, that expand our distribution capabilities, that optimize our operating platform and achieve our integration and synergy expectations. Since our management‑led buyout with Crestview GP, our strategy of enhancing our capabilities within our current focus asset classes has driven strong organic growth within these asset classes. Furthermore, the distribution channels obtained through acquisitions have enhanced our flows.
 Portfolio of Specialized Asset Classes with Potential for Outperformance
 In assembling our portfolio of Franchises, we have selected investment managers offering strategies in specialized asset classes where active managers have shown an established track record of outperformance relative to benchmarks through security selection and portfolio construction. We continue to build our platform to address the needs of clients who would like exposure to asset classes that have potential for alpha generation. We find that larger industry trends of flows moving from actively managed strategies to passive ones are not as pronounced in our current focus asset classes. Diversified Platform Across Investment Strategies, Franchises and Client Type
 We have strategically built an investment platform that is diversified by investment strategy, Franchise and client type. Within each asset class, Franchises with overlapping investment mandates still contribute to our diversification by pursuing different investment philosophies and/or processes. For example, U.S. small cap equities, which accounted for approximately 25% of our AUM as of December 31, 2018, consists of four Franchises, each following a different investment strategy. We believe the diversity in investment styles reduces the correlation between the return profiles of strategies within the same asset class, and consequently provides an additional layer of diversification and AUM and revenue stability.
 We believe our AUM is well diversified at the Franchise level, with no Franchise accounting for more than 34% of AUM, and the median Franchise comprising 7% of AUM, as of December 31, 2018. Furthermore, we believe our Franchises’ brand independence reduces the impact of each individual Franchise’s performance on clients’ perceptions of the other Franchises. The distribution of AUM by Franchise, as well as succession planning, mitigates the level of key man risk typically associated with investment management businesses.
 We believe our client base serves as another important diversifying element, as different client segments have shown to have distinct characteristics, including asset class and product preferences, sales and redemptions trends, and exposure to secular trends. We strive to maintain a balance between institutional and retail clients, with 56% and 44% of our AUM as of December 31, 2018 in each of these channels, respectively. We also have the capability to deliver our strategies in investment vehicles designed to meet the needs and preferences of investors in each channel. These investment vehicles include mutual funds with channel‑specific share classes, institutional separate accounts, SMA/UMA/CTF products and ETFs. If a strategy is currently not offered in the wrapper of choice for a client, we have the infrastructure and ability to create a new investment vehicle, which helps our Franchises further diversify their investor bases.
 Attractive Financial Profile
 Our revenues have shown to be recurring in nature, as they are based on the level of client assets we manage. The majority of our strategies are in asset classes that require specialized skill, are in higher demand and typically command higher fee rates. With the growth of our Solutions Platform, our average fee rate is likely to decline as that business continues to grow, however, our fee revenue is generated from strategies with differing return profiles, thus diversifying our revenue stream.
 Because we largely outsource our middle‑ and back‑office functions, as well as technology support, we have relatively minimal capital expenditure requirements. Approximately two‑thirds of our operating expenses are variable in nature, consisting of the incentive compensation pool for employees, sales commissions, third‑party distribution costs, sub‑advising and the fees we pay to certain of our vendors.

 We have identified three primary net income growth drivers. Firstly, we grow our AUM organically through inflows into our strategies and the market appreciation of those strategies. Secondly, we have a proven ability to grow through synergistic acquisitions. Thirdly, we have constructed a scalable platform; as our AUM increases, we expect margins to expand.
 Economic and Structural Alignment of Interests Promotes Owner‑Centric Culture
 Through our revenue share compensation model and broad employee ownership, we have structurally aligned our employees’ interests with those of our clients and other shareholders and have created an owner‑centric culture that encourages employees to act in the best interests of clients and our Company, as well as to think long term. Additionally, our employees invest in products managed by our Franchises and Solutions Platform, providing direct alignment with the interests of our clients.
 We directly align the compensation paid to our investment teams with the performance of their respective Franchises by structuring formula‑based revenue sharing on the products they manage. We believe that compensation based on revenue rather than profits encourages investment professionals to focus their attention on investment performance, while encouraging them to provide good client service, focus on client retention and attract new flows. We believe the formula‑based, client‑aligned nature of our revenue sharing fosters a culture of transparency where Franchises understand how and on what terms they are being measured to earn compensation.
 We believe the high percentage of employee ownership creates a collective alignment with our success. Further, we believe granting equity is attractive to potential new employees and is a retentive mechanism for current employees. As of December 31, 2018, our employees beneficially owned approximately 27% of our shares. In addition to being aligned with our financial success through their equity ownership, our current and former employees collectively have invested approximately $100 million in products we manage as of December 31, 2018.
 Our Growth Strategy
 We have a purposeful strategy aimed to achieve continued growth and success for our Company and our Franchises. The growth we pursue is both organic and inorganic. We seek to grow organically by offering our clients strategies that are value-added to their overall portfolios with strong performance track records. We intend to continue to supplement our growth through disciplined acquisitions as evidenced by the announcements to acquire Harvest and the USAA Acquired Companies. We primarily seek to acquire investment management firms that will add high quality investment teams, that enhance our growth and financial profile, improve our diversification by asset class and investment strategy, achieve our integration and synergy expectations, expand our distribution capabilities and optimize our operating platform. We believe one of our key advantages in a competitive sales process is our ability to provide access to new distribution channels. We believe that our centralized distribution and marketing platform drives organic growth at our acquired Franchises both by opening new distribution channels to them and providing them with the support of our sales and marketing professionals while allowing them to focus on investment performance. Organic Growth
 A key driver of our growth strategy lies in enhancing the strength of each of our existing Franchises. We primarily do this by providing them with access to our centralized distribution, marketing and operations platform. Largely unencumbered by the burdens of administrative and operational tasks, our investment professionals can focus on delivering investment excellence and maintaining strong client relationships. We also expect to help our Franchises through fund and share class launches and product development. We believe we are well positioned to help our Franchises grow their product offerings and diversify their investor base, with the ability to offer their strategies in multiple investment vehicles to meet clients’ needs.
 Our platform provides significant operating leverage to our Franchises and is a key factor in our continued success. As we continue to grow and expand, we will continue to look for ways to invest in our operations, in order to achieve greater economies of scale and provide better services to our Franchises. We continue to expand our distribution capabilities as well, demonstrated by our entry in 2016 into an exclusive distribution agreement with an independent 

 
  14

 
investment management firm in Japan, as well as our launch during the first quarter of 2017 of two emerging market UCITS funds with a global financial advisory firm. 
 We continually look to the future, and as a result, our infrastructure investments can range from the immediate to the long term. As an example, we have acquired a minority interest in Cerebellum Capital, an investment management firm that specializes in machine learning. Cerebellum Capital’s techniques help to design, execute and improve investment programs and the firm is working with a number of our Franchises to help them optimize their investment processes. We believe investments like these provide tools that can provide enhancements to our Franchises’ investment processes, give our Franchises access to proprietary technology that can give them an advantage and help position our Franchises for the future.
 Certain of our Franchise strategies have or may have capacity constraints, and we may choose to limit access to new or existing investors in these strategies such as we have done for two mutual funds managed by the Sycamore Capital Franchise, which had an aggregate of $14.3 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2018.
 We believe there is significant growth potential in solutions products, most notably in ETFs. Through our VictoryShares brand, we offer ETFs that seek to improve the risk, return and diversification profile of client portfolios. Our approach furthers our commitment to rules‑based investing and includes single‑ and multi‑factor strategies designed to provide a variety of outcomes, including maximum diversification, dividend income, downside mitigation, minimum volatility and targeted factor exposure. VictoryShares is designed to provide investors with rules‑based solutions that bridge the gap between the active and passive elements of their portfolios. Since the CEMP Acquisition in 2015, our ETF products have grown from less than $200 million in AUM to approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we ranked 26th in overall ETF AUM among 144 issuers and 21st out of 144 ETF issuers in net flows for 2018. VictoryShares ETFs have posted positive net flows every quarter since the CEMP acquisition in 2015 and in 2018 grew their market share by 33%.
 Growth through Acquisitions
 We intend to continue to accelerate growth through disciplined acquisitions. On September 21, 2018, the Company entered into the Harvest Purchase Agreement, whereby the Company has agreed to purchase 100% of the equity interests of Harvest, an asset management company specializing in yield enhancement overlay, risk reduction, alternative beta and absolute return investment strategies. Harvest offers a suite of value-added investment strategies for client portfolios that are designed to provide investors with risk-managed sources of income, absolute return and varying levels of market exposure. The acquisition will expand our Solutions Platform by adding a historically strong organic grower to our platform and will further diversify our AUM into strategies that are managed to be neutral to changing market cycles. In addition, on November 6, 2018, we entered into an agreement to acquire the USAA Acquired Companies and their Mutual Fund and ETF businesses and USAA 529 College Savings Plan. The USAA Acquired Companies have proven expertise in managing fixed income, global multi-asset and equity strategies through both internal investment teams and external subadvisors. We expect the USAA AMCO Acquisition will diversify our AUM, expand our investment capabilities, increase our size and scale and introduce a new and unique USAA direct-member distribution channel to our existing distribution platform.
 We regularly evaluate potential acquisition candidates and maintain a strong network among industry participants and advisers that provide opportunities to establish potential target relationships and source transactions. We primarily seek investment management firms that will add high quality investment teams, that enhance our growth and financial profile, improve our diversification by asset class and investment strategy, achieve our integration and synergy expectations, expand our distribution capabilities and optimize our operating platform. We have a preference for investing in asset classes where we have knowledge, provided that further acquisitions must continue to diversify our portfolio in terms of investment strategy. Our focus is not only on U.S. investment managers but also on investment styles that have an international or emerging market presence. 
 We believe the universe of potential acquisition targets has grown as a result of the evolution of the distribution landscape, the increasing cost of regulatory compliance, management fee compression and outflows from actively 

 
  15

 
managed funds to passive products. We believe our integrated multi‑boutique model makes us an attractive acquirer. Further, our centralized distribution, marketing and operations platform allows us to achieve synergies.
 Our Franchises
 As of December 31, 2018, we had our nine Franchises diversified across investment approaches, with no Franchise accounting for more than 34% of our AUM. Our Franchises are independent from one another from an investment perspective, maintain their own separate brands and logos, which they have built over time, and are led by dedicated CIOs. We customize each Franchise’s interactions with our centralized platform and the formula for its respective revenue share. Our Franchises are:

 SailingStone is based in San Francisco, CA, and managed $0.5 billion in AUM for the Company as of December 31, 2018. SailingStone’s investment team consists of six professionals with an average industry experience of approximately 18 years.
 Solutions Platform
 Our Solutions Platform consists of multi‑Franchise and customized solutions strategies that are primarily rules‑based. We offer our Solutions Platform through a variety of vehicles, including separate accounts, mutual funds and VictoryShares, which is our ETF brand. Like our Franchises, our Solutions Platform is operationally integrated and supported by our centralized distribution, marketing and operational support functions. As of December 31, 2018, VictoryShares’ investment management fees were between 30 and 45 basis points. Our Solutions Platform managed $3.8 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2018. Our Products and Investment Performance
 As of December 31, 2018, our nine Franchises and Solutions Platform offered 71 investment strategies with the majority in our current focus asset classes, consisting of U.S. small‑ and mid‑cap equities, global/non‑U.S. equities and solutions. These asset classes collectively comprised 78% of our $52.8 billion AUM as of December 31, 2018.  Product Mix
 Our investment strategies are offered through open‑end mutual funds, SMAs, UMAs, ETFs, CTFs and wrap separate account programs. Our product mix is expanding, as we have the ability to add investment vehicles to any strategy that is offered by our Franchises.
 Each individual asset class is diversified through the investment strategies of our Franchises, which each employ different investment approaches. Due to the differences in investment approaches, each of our Franchises has different return profiles for investors in different market environments while having exposure to their desired asset classes.

 Investment Performance
 Our Franchises have established a long track record of benchmark‑relative outperformance, including prior to their acquisition by us. As of December 31, 2018, 88% of our strategies by AUM had returns in excess of their respective benchmarks over a ten‑year period, 74% over a five‑year period and 68% over a three‑year period. On an equal‑weighted basis, 75% of our strategies have outperformed their benchmarks over a ten‑year period, 63% over a five‑year period and 59% over a three‑year period. We consider both the AUM‑weighted and equal‑weighted metrics in evaluating our investment performance. The advantage of the AUM‑weighted metric is that it reflects the investment performance of our Company as a whole, indicating whether we tend to outperform our benchmarks for the assets we manage. The disadvantage is that the metric fails to capture the overall effectiveness of our individual investment strategies; it does not capture whether most of our strategies tend to outperform their respective benchmarks. Conversely, the Equal‑weighted metric reflects the overall effectiveness of our individual investment strategies, but fails to capture the investment performance of our Company as a whole.

 Morningstar data as of December 31, 2018.
 Integrated Distribution, Marketing and Operations
 The centralization of our distribution, marketing and operational functions is a key component in our model, allowing our Franchises to focus on their core competencies of security selection and portfolio construction. In addition, we believe it provides our Franchises with the benefits of operating at scale, providing them with access to larger clients 

 
  21

 
as well as a more streamlined cost structure. As of December 31, 2018, we had 61 employees in management and support functions, 88 sales and marketing professionals and 114 investment professionals.
 Our centralized distribution and marketing functions lead the sales effort for both our institutional and retail channels. Our sales teams are staffed with accomplished professionals that are given specific training on how to position each of our strategies. Our teams have historically focused on developing relationships with institutional consultants and retail intermediaries. These relationships can enhance our platform’s overall reach and allow our Franchises and Solutions Platform to access more clients.
 To ensure high levels of client service, our sales teams liaise regularly with product specialists at our Franchises. The specialists are tasked with responding to institutional client and retail inquiries on product performance and also educating prospective investors and retail partners in coordination with the relevant internal sales team members. Our distribution and marketing professionals collaborate closely with our Franchises’ product specialists in order to attract new clients while also servicing and generating additional sales from existing clients.
 Institutional Sales: Our institutional sales team attracts and builds relationships with institutional clients, the largest institutional consultants and mutual fund complexes and other organizations seeking sub‑advisers. Our institutional clientele includes corporations, public funds, non‑profit organizations, Taft‑Hartley plans, sub‑advisory clients, international clients and insurance companies. Our institutional sales and client‑service professionals manage existing client relationships, serve consultants and prospects and/or focus on specific segments. They have extensive experience and a comprehensive understanding of our investment activities. On average, each of our client‑facing institutional sales professionals has over 20 years of industry tenure.
 Retail Sales: Our retail sales team is split among regional external wholesalers, retirement specialists and national account specialists, all of whom are supported by an internal calling desk. In the retail channel, we focus on gathering assets through intermediaries, such as banks, broker‑dealers, wirehouses, retirement platforms and RIA networks. As of December 31, 2018, 57% of our retail AUM was through intermediaries, while 43% was through retirement platforms. We offer mutual funds and separately managed wrap and unified managed accounts on intermediary and retirement platforms. We have agreements with many of the largest platforms in our retail channel, which has provided an opportunity to place our retail products on those platforms. Further, to enhance our presence on large distribution platforms, we have focused our efforts on servicing intermediary home offices and research departments. These efforts have led to strong growth in platform penetration, as measured by investment products on approved and recommended lists, as well as our inclusion in model portfolios. This penetration provides the opportunity for us to sell more products through distribution platforms. As of December 31, 2018, we had at least one and as many as 20 products on the research recommended/model portfolios of the top ten U.S. intermediary platforms by AUM. These top intermediary platforms included Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch and Raymond James. We also have agreements with all of the top 20 retirement platforms by AUM, including Fidelity, Vanguard, Voya and Merrill Lynch. As of December 31, 2018, we had at least one and as many as eight approved products on the recommended list of each of those top 20 retirement platforms that have recommended lists.
 Marketing: Our distribution efforts are supplemented by our marketing function, which is primarily responsible for enhancing the visibility and quality of our portfolio of brands. They are specifically tasked with managing corporate, Franchise and Solutions Platform branding efforts, database management, the development of marketing materials, website design and the publishing of white papers. They are also a key component in our responses to requests for proposals sent over by prospective clients. The success of their efforts can be seen by our eVestment #1 ranking for Institutional Brand Awareness among asset managers with between $25 billion and $50 billion in AUM in 2015, our #4 ranking among asset managers with between $50 billion and $100 billion in AUM in both 2016 and 2017 and our #6 ranking among asset managers with between $50 billion and $100 billion in AUM in 2018.
 Operations: Our centralized operations functions provide our Franchises and Solutions Platform with the support they need so that they can focus on their investment processes. Our centralized operations functions include trading platforms, risk and compliance, middle‑ and back‑office support, finance, human resources, accounting and legal. Although our operations are centralized, we do allow our Franchises a degree of customization with respect to their desired 

 
  22

 
investment support functions, which we believe helps them maintain their individualized investment processes and minimize undue disruptions.
 We outsource certain middle‑ and back‑office activities, such as trade settlement, portfolio analytics, custodian reconciliation, portfolio accounting, corporate action processing, performance calculation and client reporting, to scaled, recognized service providers, who provide their services to us on a variable‑cost basis. Systems and processes are customized as necessary to support our investment processes and operations. We maintain relationships with multiple vendors for the majority of our outsourced functions, which we believe mitigates vendor‑specific risk. We also have information security, business continuity and data privacy programs in place to help mitigate risk.
 Outsourcing these functions enables us to grow our AUM, both organically and through acquisitions, without the incremental capital expenditures and working capital that would typically be needed. Under our direction and oversight, our outsourced model enhances our ability to integrate our acquisitions, as we are experienced in working with our vendors to efficiently bring additional Franchises onto our platform in a cost‑efficient manner.
 We believe both the scalability of our business and our cost structure, in which approximately two‑thirds of our operating expenses are variable, should drive increasing margins and facilitate free cash flow conversion. Additionally, we believe having a majority of our expenses tied to AUM and the number of client accounts provides downside margin protection should there be sustained net outflows or adverse market conditions.
 Competition
 We compete in various markets, asset classes and investment vehicles. We sell our investment products in the traditional institutional segments and intermediary and retirement distribution channels, which include mutual funds, wrap accounts, UMAs and ETFs. We face competition in attracting and retaining assets from other investment management firms. Additionally, we compete with other acquirers of investment management firms, including independent, fully integrated investment management firms and multi‑boutique businesses, insurance companies, banks, private equity firms and other financial institutions.
 We compete with other managers offering similar strategies. Some of these organizations have greater financial resources and capabilities than we are able to offer and have had strong performance track records. We compete with other investment management firms for client assets based on the following primary factors:

· | our investment performance track record of delivering alpha;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | the specialized nature of our investment strategies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | fees charged;
--+--------------


· | access to distribution channels;
--+---------------------------------


· | client service; and
--+--------------------


· | our employees’ alignment of interests with investors.
--+------------------------------------------------------

  We compete with other potential acquirers of investment management firms primarily on the basis of the following factors:

· | the strength of our distribution relationships;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | the value we add through centralized distribution, marketing and operations platforms;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  23

 


· | the investment autonomy Franchises retain post acquisition;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | the tenure and continuity of our management and investment professionals; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the value that can be delivered to the seller through realization of synergies created by the combination of the businesses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our ability to continue to compete effectively will also depend upon our ability to retain our current investment professionals and employees and to attract highly qualified new investment professionals and employees. For additional information concerning the competitive risks that we face, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry—The investment management industry is intensely competitive.”
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 263 employees. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement and have never been subject to a work stoppage. We believe we have maintained satisfactory relationships with our employees. Business Organization

Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. was formed in 2013 for the purpose of acquiring VCM and VCA from KeyCorp. VCM is a registered investment adviser managing assets through open‑end mutual funds, separately managed accounts, unified management accounts, ETFs, collective trust funds, wrap separate account programs and UCITs. VCM also provides mutual fund administrative services for the Victory Portfolios, Victory Variable Insurance Funds, Victory Institutional Funds and the mutual fund series of the Victory Portfolios II (collectively, “the Victory Funds”), a family of open-end mutual funds, and the VictoryShares (the Company’s ETF brand). VCM additionally employs all of our U.S. investment professionals across our Franchises and Solutions Platform, which are not separate legal entities. VCA is registered with the SEC as an introducing broker‑dealer and serves as distributor and underwriter for the Victory Funds. Initial Public Offering and Debt Repayment
 On February 12, 2018, we issued 11,700,000 shares of Class A common stock in the IPO at a price of $13.00 per share for net proceeds of $143.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts. Net proceeds received from the IPO and the Existing Credit Agreement of $143.0 million and $355.9 million, respectively, together with $0.8 million of cash on hand, were used to repay the $499.7 million of outstanding term loans under the 2014 Credit Agreement. 
 On March 13, 2018, the Company issued an additional 1,110,860 shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of their option for net proceeds of $13.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts. The net proceeds from the underwriters’ exercise of their option and operating cash flow were used to pay down $80.0 million of the Existing Credit Agreement in 2018 to bring the balance to $280.0 million at December 31, 2018. See Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 Regulatory Environment and Compliance
 Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States at the federal level and, to a lesser extent, the state level, as well as regulation by self‑regulatory organizations and outside the United States. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines.

 SEC Investment Adviser and Investment Company Registration/Regulation
 VCM is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act, and the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and several of the investment companies we sub‑advise are registered under the 1940 Act. The Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, together with the SEC’s regulations and interpretations thereunder, impose substantive and material restrictions and requirements on the operations of advisers and registered funds. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an adviser’s registration. As an investment adviser, we have a fiduciary duty to our clients. The SEC has interpreted that duty to impose standards, requirements and limitations on, among other things: trading for proprietary, personal and client accounts; allocations of investment opportunities among clients; use of soft dollars; execution of transactions; and recommendations to clients. We manage accounts for all of our clients on a discretionary basis, with authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker‑dealers to execute trades and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with certain of these transactions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker‑dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses. All of our soft dollar arrangements are intended to be within the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act. If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of the implementation of statutory amendments or new regulations, our operating expenses would increase.
 As a registered adviser, VCM is subject to many additional requirements that cover, among other things: disclosure of information about our business to clients; maintenance of written policies and procedures; maintenance of extensive books and records; restrictions on the types of fees we may charge; custody of client assets; client privacy; advertising; and solicitation of clients. The SEC has authority to inspect any investment adviser and typically inspects a registered adviser periodically to determine whether the adviser is conducting its activities (i) in accordance with applicable laws, (ii) in a manner that is consistent with disclosures made to clients and (iii) with adequate systems and procedures to ensure compliance.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, 83% of our total revenues were derived from our services to investment companies registered under the 1940 Act—i.e., mutual funds and ETFs. The 1940 Act imposes significant requirements and limitations on a registered fund, including with respect to its capital structure, investments and transactions. While we exercise broad discretion over the day‑to‑day management of the business and affairs of the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and the investment portfolios of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares and the funds we sub‑advise, our own operations are subject to oversight and management by each fund’s board of directors. Under the 1940 Act, a majority of the directors of our registered funds must not be “interested persons” with respect to us (sometimes referred to as the “independent director” requirement) in order to rely on certain exemptive rules under the 1940 Act relevant to the operation of registered funds. The responsibilities of the fund’s board include, among other things: approving our investment advisory agreement with the fund (or, for sub‑advisory arrangements, our sub‑advisory agreement with the fund’s investment adviser); approving other service providers; determining the method of valuing assets; and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. Our investment advisory agreements with these funds may be terminated by the funds on not more than 60 days’ notice and are subject to annual renewal by the fund’s board after the initial term of one to two years. The 1940 Act also imposes on the investment adviser or sub‑adviser to a registered fund a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of the adviser’s investment management fees or the sub‑adviser’s sub‑advisory fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC, by administrative action or by litigation by investors in the fund pursuant to a private right of action.
 As required by the Advisers Act, our investment advisory agreements may not be assigned without the client’s consent. Under the 1940 Act, investment advisory agreements with registered funds (such as the mutual funds and ETFs we manage) terminate automatically upon assignment. The term “assignment” is broadly defined and includes direct assignments as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a “controlling block” of our outstanding voting securities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—An assignment could result in termination of our investment advisory agreements to manage SEC‑registered funds and could trigger consent requirements in our other investment advisory agreements.”

 SEC Broker‑Dealer Registration/FINRA Regulation
 VCA is subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA and various states. In addition, certain of our employees are registered with FINRA and such states and subject to SEC, state and FINRA regulation. The failure of these companies and/or employees to comply with relevant regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 ERISA‑Related Regulation
 We are a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to assets that we manage for benefit plan clients subject to ERISA. ERISA, the regulations promulgated thereunder and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The duties under ERISA require, among other obligations, that fiduciaries perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries.
 CFTC Regulation
 VCM is registered with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator and is a member of the NFA, a self‑regulatory organization for the U.S. derivatives industry. In addition, certain of our employees are registered with the CFTC and members of NFA. Registration with the CFTC and NFA membership subject VCM to regulation by the CFTC and the NFA including, but not limited to, reporting, recordkeeping, disclosure, self‑examination and training requirements. Registration with the CFTC also subjects VCM to periodic on‑site audits. Each of the CFTC and NFA is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of applicable regulations.
 Non‑U.S. Regulation
 In addition to the extensive regulation to which we are subject in the United States, we are subject to regulation internationally. Our business is also subject to the rules and regulations of the countries in which we market our funds or services and conduct investment activities.
 In Singapore, we are subject to, among others, the Securities and Futures Act, or the SFA, the Financial Advisers Act, or the FAA, and the subsidiary legislation promulgated pursuant to these Acts, which are administered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, or the MAS. We and our employees conducting regulated activities specified in the SFA and/or the FAA are required to be licensed with the MAS. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, codes, directives, notices and guidelines issued by the MAS may result in penalties including fines, censures and the suspension or revocation of licenses granted by the MAS.
 In Hong Kong, we are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance, or the SFO, and its subsidiary legislation, which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of dealing in securities and investment management activities and intermediaries. This legislation is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission, or the SFC. The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. We and our employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time. Failure to comply with the applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines could result in various sanctions being imposed, including fines, reprimands and the suspension or revocation of the licenses granted by the SFC.
 Compliance
 Our legal and compliance functions are integrated into one team of 10 professionals as of December 31, 2018. This group is responsible for all legal and regulatory compliance matters, as well as for monitoring adherence to client investment guidelines. Our legal and compliance teams work through a well‑established reporting and communication structure to ensure we have a consistent and holistic program for legal and regulatory compliance. Senior management is also involved at various levels in all of these functions. We cannot assure that our legal and compliance functions will be

effective to prevent all losses. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—If our techniques for managing risk are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.”
 For more information about our regulatory environment, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry—As an investment management firm, we are subject to extensive regulation” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry—The regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to continual change and regulatory developments designed to increase oversight may materially adversely affect our business.”
