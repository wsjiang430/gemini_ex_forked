ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a portfolio of product candidates to treat patients suffering from central nervous system (“CNS”), diseases. Leveraging our scientific insights and clinical experience, we have acquired or in-licensed four development-stage proprietary compounds that we believe have innovative mechanisms of action and therapeutic profiles that potentially address the unmet needs of patients with these diseases. 
 Our product portfolio and potential indications include: roluperidone (also known as MIN-101) for the treatment of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia; seltorexant (also known as MIN-202 or JNJ-42847922), which we are co-developing with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, or Janssen, for the treatment of insomnia disorder and adjunctive treatment of Major Depressive Disorder, or aMDD; MIN-117 for the treatment of MDD; and MIN-301 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. We believe our product candidates have significant potential to improve the lives of a large number of affected patients and their families who are currently not well-served by available therapies. According to Datamonitor, an independent market research firm, in 2018 approximately 2.9 million people suffered from schizophrenia, 27.9 million suffered from MDD and 2.0 million suffered from Parkinson’s disease in the United States (“U.S.”), Japan and the five major European Union (“EU”) markets of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. I

nsomnia as a symptom affects up to 50% of the general population, while insomnia with significant daytime consequences is estimated to affect 7% to 13% of the population worldwide and is recognized as a major public health issue. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to develop and commercialize first-in-class products that address critical unmet medical needs in the CNS therapeutic area. We are pursuing this strategy based on the following principles: selection of differentiated products with novel mechanisms of action that target therapeutic areas of high unmet need and significant disease burden; attention to patient safety and compliance; scientific rigor applied to patient selection and clinical trial conduct; engagement of highly trained clinical trial investigators; incorporation of patient and caregiver insights to drive clinical advancements; and integrity. With the experience and knowledge base of our clinicians and physicians, we have generated substantive data from randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials that support the clinical advancement of these products in defined patient populations and in multiple regulatory jurisdictions. In summary, key elements of our strategy are to:

• | Identify, acquire and develop differentiated products with innovative mechanisms of action based on biological and clinical insights into the unmet needs of patients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled data from completed trials to advance the clinical development of our product candidates in multiple regulatory jurisdictions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prepare for the commercialization of our lead product, roluperidone, which will potentially be the first product approved to treat negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and, in the longer term as a potential treatment for other neuro-degenerative brain disorders in which negative symptoms represent a significant debilitating, unmet need;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our History 
 In November 2013, Cyrenaic Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Cyrenaic, and Sonkei Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Sonkei, merged, and the combined company was renamed Minerva Neurosciences, Inc. Cyrenaic had been incorporated in 2007 and had exclusively licensed roluperidone and other compounds with a similar structure and intended purpose from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, or MTPC. Sonkei had been incorporated in 2008 and had exclusively licensed MIN-117 from MTPC. We saw the merger as an opportunity to better serve underserved patient populations through combining a portfolio of promising product candidates targeting multiple CNS diseases. As a result of the merger, we have the rights to develop and commercialize roluperidone and MIN-117 globally, excluding most of Asia, where MIPC has retained commercialization rights. 
 We further expanded our product candidate portfolio in February 2014 by acquiring the shares of Mind-NRG Sarl, or Mind-NRG, which had exclusive rights to develop and commercialize MIN-301 globally. In addition, in February 2014 we entered into a co-development and license agreement with Janssen, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. Pursuant to this agreement, subsequently amended in June 2017, we are co-developing seltorexant and have the right to commercialize this compound in the European Union, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway, or the Minerva Territory, subject to royalty payments to Janssen, with Janssen having commercialization rights outside of the Minerva Territory, subject to royalty payments to us.  
 We have not received regulatory approvals to commercialize any of our product candidates, and we have not generated any revenue from the sales or license of our product candidates. We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. We expect to incur net losses and negative cash flow from operating activities for the foreseeable future in connection with the clinical development and the potential regulatory approval, infrastructure development and commercialization of our product candidates.

Our Pipeline of Advanced Clinical-Stage Programs 
 

Roluperidone (MIN-101)
 Introduction
 Roluperidone is a compound that has been shown to block serotonin receptors and sigma receptors, two receptors in the brain that are involved in the regulation of mood, cognition, sleep and anxiety. We are developing roluperidone to treat patients with schizophrenia. Roluperidone has been designed to block a specific subtype of serotonin receptor called 5-HT2A. When 5-HT2A is blocked, certain symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations, delusions, agitation and thought and movement disorders, as well as the side effects associated with antipsychotic treatments, can be minimized. Additionally, blocking 5-HT2A promotes slow wave sleep, a sleep stage often disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. Roluperidone has also been designed to block a specific subtype of sigma receptor called sigma2, which is involved in movement control, psychotic symptom control and learning and memory. Blocking sigma2 also increases calcium levels in neurons in the brain, which can improve memory. Recent pre-clinical findings provide evidence of the effect of roluperidone on Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“BDNF”), which has been associated with neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, synapse regulation, learning and memory.
 We believe the scientifically supported and innovative mechanisms of action of roluperidone may potentially address the unmet needs of schizophrenic patients, which include negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, without the side effects of existing therapies. Negative symptoms are lifelong debilitating symptoms and include: asociality, or the lack of motivation to engage in social interactions; anhedonia, or the inability to experience positive emotions; alogia, or failure to engage in normal conversation; avolition, or loss of energy and interest in activities; and blunted affect, or diminished emotional expression. We plan to seek approval of 
 5


roluperidone initially as a first line treatment of negative symptoms in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, and we also may study its use to treat all aspects of the disease, including positive symptoms and relapse prevention. We believe that roluperidone, if approved, could treat the majority of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. An estimated 69% of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have negative symptoms, with at least 42% of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia having prominent negative symptoms. Beyond schizophrenia, we believe roluperidone may possess therapeutic utility in brain disorders where negative symptoms are a significant unmet need and a core feature of the disease associated with a range of poor clinical outcomes.  
 Clinical Development
Phase 3 Clinical Trial
 In December 2017, the first patient was screened in the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of roluperidone (Study MIN-101C07) as monotherapy for negative symptoms in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. The trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 12-week study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 32 milligrams, or mg, and 64 mg of roluperidone in adult patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The 12-week study will be followed by a 40-week, open-label extension period during which patients on drug will continue receiving their original dose and patients on placebo will receive either 32 mg or 64 mg of roluperidone.    
 The approximately 500 patients we expect to enroll in this trial at clinical sites in the U.S. and Europe will be initially randomized equally to receive one of the two doses of roluperidone or placebo for 12 weeks. Thereafter, all patients will continue treatment with roluperidone for the 40-week extension period if they elect to enter that period.
 We expect the completion of enrollment during the first half of 2019 and top-line results from the 12-week, double-blind period in mid-2019.    
 The primary endpoint of this trial will be improvement in negative symptoms in patients treated with roluperidone compared to placebo as measured by the change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or PANSS, Marder negative symptoms factor score, or NSFS, over the 12-week double-blind treatment period. To support the use of the Marder NSFS as the primary endpoint in the Phase 3 study, it was applied to the Phase 2b PANSS data, and the resulting analysis confirmed the robustness of the effect of roluperidone for the two tested doses. The key secondary endpoint will be the effect of roluperidone compared to placebo as measured by the Personal and Social Performance, or PSP, total score over the same period. Additional secondary endpoints will be the effect of roluperidone compared to placebo on the Clinical Global Impression of Severity, or CGI-S, score and safety and tolerability.
 Patients admitted into the trial must have a documented diagnosis of schizophrenia for at least one year and be symptomatically stable for at least 6 months with moderate to severe negative symptoms (>20 on the PANSS negative symptom subscale) and stable positive symptoms. Patients without moderate to severe symptoms of excitement/hyperactivity, suspiciousness/persecution, hostility, uncooperativeness, or poor impulse control will be recruited. We believe these eligibility criteria represent the real-world patient population who may benefit when the drug is used in clinical practice. In addition, patients treated with psychotropic agents will need to undergo a wash-out period of a few days before receiving study drug. These parameters were applied in screening the population treated in the Phase 2b trial.  
 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls program
 The chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) scale-up program for roluperidone is ongoing to ensure consistency between the drug batches to be used during Phase 3 testing and those that will be available for potential marketing and commercialization pending the completion of our Phase 3 trial and subsequent regulatory submission and review of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for roluperidone. The CMC program requires validation of all aspects of the manufacturing processes required to result in a drug product that consistently meets approved quality standards.
 Dose Escalation Study
 We have completed a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized single-escalating dose study in healthy subjects to evaluate the investigational drug roluperidone as monotherapy administered at nine ascending doses (16, 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 224 and 256 mg). The highest dose tested is 4 multiples of the highest dose (64 mg) being used in the ongoing Phase 3 trial.
 The primary objectives of the study included the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics, dose-proportionality and the effect of plasma concentrations of roluperidone and its main metabolites on pharmacodynamic parameters using electrocardiogram (“ECG”) Fridericia-corrected QT interval (“QTcF”), a measurement of cardiac function. Secondary objectives included evaluation of safety and 
 6


tolerability. An additional objective was to provide an estimate of the supra-therapeutic dose to be used in the thorough QT study planned as part of the NDA.  
 The trial included a total of 90 subjects. 72 received 9 different doses of roluperidone, and 18 received placebo. All subjects who were dosed completed the study as planned except for one male subject who received placebo and subsequently withdrew his consent.
 Data from this trial demonstrated the following:
 
 
• | The pharmacokinetics of roluperidone and its metabolites were dose proportional.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No QTcF duration > 480 milliseconds (“msec”) or increases > 60 msec compared to baseline values were observed in any subject.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 160 mg was the only roluperidone dose to show an adjusted QTcF mean increase from baseline of 10.7 msec. All other doses showed means below 10 msec that ranged from -1.3 to 5 msec.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No significant change in repolarization was observed.
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Two subjects (11%) in the placebo group and nine subjects (13%) in the roluperidone group reported adverse events that were mild to moderate in severity and resolved without sequelae.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Doses up to 160 mg or 2.5 multiples of the highest dose being tested in the ongoing Phase 3 trial had no effect on any cardiac safety parameters.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Slight but not clinically relevant increases in heart rate were observed in the placebo group and some of the roluperidone doses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No serious adverse events were reported.
--+-----------------------------------------

 We believe these findings suggest an expanded therapeutic window and a significantly improved safety margin for roluperidone. They provide further evidence that the formulation being used in the Phase 3 trial has a significantly reduced maximum concentration (“Cmax”) of the BFB-520 metabolite when compared to the formulation used in the Phase 2b trial, thereby reducing the potential for transient QTc increases at the doses currently tested in the Phase 3 trial. Furthermore, we believe these data suggest the potential for future testing of roluperidone in schizophrenic patients with an exacerbation of psychosis at higher doses than those being used in the Phase 3 trial.
 Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“BDNF”) Findings
 We have completed a pre-clinical study that provides evidence of the effect of roluperidone on BDNF. BDNF is the most widely distributed member of neurotrophins in the brain and has been associated with neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, synapse regulation, learning and memory. Its involvement in schizophrenia has also been described. In this study, after three days of administration, roluperidone was observed to significantly increase the release of BDNF in cultured brain hippocampal neurons in a dose-dependent manner. We believe these findings, along with clinical results, may suggest the potential of roluperidone to change the overall course of schizophrenia.
 The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry Publication
 The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry has published online results demonstrating cognitive improvements in patients with schizophrenia treated with roluperidone (Cognitive Effects on MIN-101 in Patients with Schizophrenia and Negative Symptoms: Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial). The results also demonstrated that cognitive improvements correlate with previously reported improvements in negative symptoms. This is the third peer-reviewed publication of Phase 2b data with roluperidone.
 MIN-117
 Introduction
 We are developing MIN-117 to treat patients suffering from moderate to severe MDD with anxiety. Patients suffering from MDD experience feelings of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, changes in sleep such as insomnia, fatigue and diminished ability to concentrate that interfere with their ability to carry out and enjoy once-pleasurable activities. While suicide is the leading cause of death in those with MDD, other factors, such as changes in immune function and susceptibility to disease, can also lead to early mortality.
 We believe MIN-117 has the potential to address limitations of existing therapies, such as slow onset of action and poor safety and tolerability, without many of the typical side effects associated with currently approved therapies. The pharmacological effects of 
 7


MIN-117 are related to serotonin and dopamine, two neurotransmitters in the brain. MIN-117 is meant to block a specific subtype of serotonin receptor called 5-HT1A. When 5-HT1A is blocked, anxiety and mood can be regulated. In addition, MIN-117 is meant to prevent the reuptake of serotonin and dopamine, which increases the amount of serotonin and dopamine in the brain, which is tied to an improvement in mood in individuals suffering from MDD. MIN-117 is also meant to modulate the levels of Alpha-1a and 1b, which further modulates serotonin and dopamine.
 Based upon clinical and non-clinical studies completed to date, we believe MIN-117 may demonstrate a safety profile comparable to placebo without many of the typical side effects of current MDD treatments, including cognitive impairment, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders and weight gain. As part of our license agreement with MTPC, we may develop, sell, and import products based on the MIN-117 compound globally, excluding most of Asia. 
 Clinical Development
 Phase 2b Trial
 We initiated a Phase 2b trial in MDD in the U.S. and Europe on April 9, 2018. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of two fixed doses of MIN-117, 5.0 mg and 2.5 mg daily, compared with placebo in reducing the symptoms of major depression as measured by the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (“MADRS”) total score over six weeks of treatment. Secondary objectives include: (1) assessment of the change from baseline in symptoms of anxiety using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (“HAM-A”); (2) the change in severity of illness using the Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale (“CGI-S”) and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale (“CGI-I”); and (3) safety over six weeks of treatment. 
 The study is recruiting adults with a diagnosis of moderate or severe MDD with anxious distress and without psychotic features. Based upon previous clinical observations, we believe that patients with MDD who also have symptoms of anxiety may benefit from treatment with MIN-117.
 Approximately 324 patients are expected to be enrolled in the U.S. and Europe. Patients will be randomized to one of three arms, including placebo and the two dosage arms, in a 2:1:1 ratio, resulting in approximately 162 patients in the placebo group and 81 patients in each of the two MIN-117 treatment groups. The study design includes a screening phase of up to three weeks, a six-week double-blind treatment phase and a two-week post-study follow-up period. Top line results are expected in the first half of 2019.
 New Patent Application Related to Pain
 We have filed a U.S. patent application for MIN-117 to treat pain.  Pre-clinical rat models submitted in the patent application included peripheral motoneuropathy, inflammatory pain and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain.  Findings in these models showed that MIN-117 restored approximately 60 percent of the nociceptive pain threshold after peripheral motoneuropathy or inflammatory pain and significantly reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain.
 These results suggest that MIN-117 may be a candidate for study in the treatment of diseases with chronic pain symptoms and may have the potential to address the urgent need for non-opioid therapeutic options for the treatment of pain.  Furthermore, the currently available treatments for chronic pain are often not satisfactory and may be associated with adverse reactions, tolerance, dependence and reductions in the quality of life for patients.
 Seltorexant (MIN-202)
 Introduction
 Seltorexant is an innovative selective orexin 2 receptor antagonist we are co-developing with Janssen for the treatment of insomnia and aMDD. Insomnia is the repeated difficulty with sleep initiation, maintenance or quality that occurs despite adequate time and opportunity for sleep, resulting in daytime impairment. Insomnia can be the primary condition for patients or a secondary symptom of, and contributor to, another medical or psychiatric condition, such as MDD or schizophrenia. 
 In the brain, the orexin system is involved in the control of several key functions, including metabolism and wakefulness. Seltorexant seeks to inhibit the activity of the neurons that promote wakefulness by selectively blocking the orexin 2 receptor. Rather than making an individual sleepier as is the case with many commercially available therapies that mediate their effect via the Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (“GABA”) neurotransmitter pathway, blocking the orexin 2 receptor reduces the level of the neurotransmitters that signal the brain to maintain vigilance and wakefulness, which can be helpful for patients with insomnia.

We are co-developing seltorexant with Janssen and own the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the compound in the Minerva Territory subject to royalty payments to Janssen and we have the right to receive royalties on any sales outside the Minerva Territory. 
 Amendment to Co-Development and License Agreement with Janssen
 In June 2017, we entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the co-development and license agreement with Janssen dated February 13, 2014 (the “Agreement”). The effectiveness of the Amendment was contingent upon approval of its terms by the European Commission and the closing of the acquisition of Actelion Ltd. by affiliates of Janssen. These conditions were subsequently met, and the Amendment became effective on August 29, 2017. Under the Amendment, Janssen has waived its right to royalties on seltorexant insomnia sales in the Minerva Territory. We retain all of our rights to seltorexant, including commercialization of the molecule for the treatment of insomnia and aMDD, which include an exclusive license in the Minerva Territory, with royalties payable by us to Janssen on seltorexant sales outside of the insomnia indication. Royalties on sales outside of the Minerva Territory are payable by Janssen to us. Janssen made an upfront payment to us of $30 million upon the effectiveness of the Amendment and agreed to make a $20 million payment at the start of a Phase 3 insomnia trial for seltorexant and a $20 million payment when 50% of the patients are enrolled in this trial. Janssen further agreed to waive development payments from us until completion of the Phase 2b development milestone. This milestone is referred to as “Decision Point 4” and is expected to occur in the second half of 2019. The $30 million payment and $11.2 million in previously accrued collaborative expenses, which were forgiven upon the effective date of the Amendment, are earned and recognized as revenue as the services are performed from the commencement of Phase 3 development to the completion of the development activities using the proportional performance method. The $30 million payment along with the $11.2 million in previously accrued collaborative expenses have been included under deferred revenue on our balance sheet at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. In connection with the Amendment, we repurchased all of the approximately 3.9 million shares of our common stock previously owned by Johnson & Johnson Innovation-JJDC Inc. at a per share price of $0.0001, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $389.
 As a result of the Amendment, we assumed strategic control of matters relating to the clinical development of seltorexant for insomnia and have no further financial obligations until after Decision Point 4. After Decision Point 4, both we and Janssen have the right to opt-out of the Agreement.
 If we opt-out, we collect a royalty on worldwide sales of seltorexant in the single digits with no further obligations to Janssen. If Janssen opts-out, the Minerva Territory would be expanded to include North America and we would pay Janssen royalties on sales of seltorexant outside of the insomnia indication in the single digits. 
 If both parties elect to continue past Decision Point 4 into Phase 3, we would be obligated to fund the clinical trials related to insomnia, receive up to $40 million in milestone payments from Janssen, and be responsible for 40% of all costs incurred in the Phase 3 aMDD program.  
 Clinical Development
 Phase 2b Trials in MDD 
 A Phase 2b trial of seltorexant as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants is ongoing in adult patients with MDD who have responded inadequately to antidepressant therapy (the “2001 Trial”). The primary objectives of this multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled, adaptive-dose finding study are to assess the dose-response relationship and antidepressant effects of up to three doses of seltorexant (10, 20, and 40 mg) and to assess the safety and tolerability of seltorexant compared to placebo. The trial consists of three phases: a screening phase lasting up to four weeks, a six-week double-blind treatment phase and a two-week post-treatment follow-up phase. We plan to enroll approximately 280 patients in the U.S., Europe, Russia and Japan.
 A Phase 2b clinical trial comparing seltorexant versus quetiapine as adjunctive therapy is ongoing in patients with MDD who have responded inadequately to antidepressant therapy (the “2002 Trial”). The primary objective of this multi-center, double-blind, randomized, flexible-dose, parallel-group study is to assess the efficacy of flexibly dosed seltorexant compared to flexibly dosed quetiapine as adjunctive therapy to a baseline antidepressant drug in delaying time to all-cause discontinuation of study drug over a 6-month treatment period. Time to all-cause discontinuation is defined as the number of days from administration of the first dose of study drug to administration of the last dose of study drug. The trial consists of three phases: a screening phase lasting up to four weeks, a six-month double-blind treatment phase and a two-week follow-up phase. Approximately 100 patients 18 to 64 years of age are planned to be randomized in the U.S. to receive either flexibly dosed seltorexant, 20 mg or 40 mg, or flexibly dosed quetiapine XR, 150 mg or 300 mg. Subjects will continue to take their baseline antidepressant therapy of either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (“SSRI”) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (“SNRI”) at the same dose throughout the screening, double-blind and follow-up phases.
 9


Enrollment in the 2002 trial was temporarily suspended during the first quarter of 2018 due to a drug packaging issue. This issue has been resolved, and enrollment was restarted in the second quarter of 2018. We have completed preclinical fertility studies in female rats to assess the potential relevance to exposing women of child bearing potential to seltorexant and have requested regulatory clearance to lift the ban on enrolling these women.
 We expect the top-line results from the 2001 Trial in MDD in the second quarter of 2019 and top-line results from the 2002 Trial in MDD in mid-2019.
 Phase 2b Trial in Insomnia Disorder
 A Phase 2b clinical trial of seltorexant is ongoing in patients with insomnia disorder (the “2005 Trial”). This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled dose finding study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of seltorexant in both adult and elderly subjects with insomnia disorder. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the dose-response of three doses of seltorexant (5, 10 and 20 mg daily) compared to placebo on sleep onset as measured by the latency to persistent sleep (“LPS”) using polysomnography (“PSG”). The key secondary objective is to assess the dose-response of these three doses compared to placebo on wake after sleep onset (“WASO”) over the first six hours using PSG. In addition, the effects of seltorexant on sleep and cognition will be compared to those effects of zolpidem to determine potential differences between the compounds.
 A total of approximately 360 patients 18 to 85 years of age are expected to be randomized in this study at clinical sites in the U.S., EU, and Japan.
 We expect the top-line results from the 2005 Trial in mid-2019.
 MIN-301
 Introduction
 We are developing MIN-301, a soluble recombinant form of the Neuregulin-1b1, or NRG-1b1, protein, for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and potentially for other neurodegenerative disorders. We believe MIN-301 has the potential to slow the onset of, and restore the brain tissue damage caused by, the disease. MIN-301 is produced by recombinant technology, which is a type of process that modifies the genetics of a biological organism to cause it to produce a particular product. MIN-301 is a peptide that contains the extracellular domain of the human neureglin-1 beta 1 protein and is produced using an Escherichia coli organism that is genetically engineered to express this peptide. Once administrated, this peptide binds to a particular receptor, ErbB4, which produces certain biological effects. For instance, binding to ErbB4 modulates the levels of certain neurotransmitters such as Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (“GABA”) and glutamate in the brain, which are often unbalanced in individuals with Parkinson’s disease. Further, ErbB4 promotes oxygenation and metabolism of neurons and it is involved in the control of brain inflammation, which may indicate that MIN-301 could reverse the damage caused by Parkinson’s disease.
 Current treatments for Parkinson’s disease improve the symptoms of patients, but none have been proven to delay the onset of the disease, slow or prevent the progression of the disease or reverse its effects. Due to MIN-301’s novel mechanism of action that targets neurological deficits, we believe MIN-301 has the potential to address these unmet needs of patients and, if approved, may be used as an early-stage monotherapy as well as a complementary therapy to existing treatments.
 Pre-clinical Development
 Results from a non-human primate study showed that treatment with an analog of MIN-301 resulted in improvements in a range of symptoms associated with a Parkinson’s disease model in primates. The results confirmed the beneficial effects of MIN-301 in non-primate preclinical models. We believe these data provide support for advancing MIN-301 into clinical trials for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease in humans. Building upon these data, we are continuing to conduct preclinical studies in preparation for an IND or Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier, or IMPD, filing, with a Phase 1 study expected to commence thereafter.
License Agreements 
 Roluperidone License Agreement with MTPC 
 We have entered into a license agreement with MTPC dated as of August 30, 2007, as amended, or the Roluperidone License Agreement. Under the terms of the Roluperidone License Agreement, we acquired an exclusive license to the lead compound known as CYR-101 (subsequently renamed MIN-101 and roluperidone), and other compounds with a similar structure and intended purpose 
 10


and other data included within the valid claims of certain patents licensed to us under the Roluperidone License Agreement. The license is for world-wide rights other than certain countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea. We will pay MTPC a tiered royalty for net sales of product by us or any of our affiliates or sublicensees containing the licensed compound at a range of percentages of the high single digits to the low teens depending on net sales of products under the Roluperidone License Agreement. We were also required to make certain milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones, potentially up to $57.5 million for roluperidone and up to $59.5 million for additional products. 
 In January 2014, we renegotiated the structure of the license for roluperidone such that we are required to make milestone payments upon the achievement of one development milestone totaling $0.5 million and certain commercial milestones, which could total up to $47.5 million, in the aggregate, as well as the tiered royalty payments described above. In addition, in the event that we sell the rights to the license, MTPC will be entitled to a percentage of milestone payments in the low teens and a percentage of royalties received by us in the low double digits. This license agreement has a term of the later of 12 years from the launch of the product in each country in our territory, or the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties, upon which we will have a fully paid-up, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license. Our obligation to pay royalties continues, on a country-by-country basis, until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent that covers roluperidone in each country in our territory. 
 MIN-117 License Agreement with MTPC 
 Sonkei entered into a license agreement with MTPC dated September 1, 2008, as amended, or the MIN-117 License Agreement. Under the terms of the MIN-117 License Agreement, we acquired an exclusive license to the lead compound known as SON-117 (subsequently renamed MIN-117) and other data included within the valid claims of certain patents licensed to us under the MIN-117 License Agreement. Sonkei paid MTPC an initial license fee of $0.5 million. The license is for world-wide rights other than certain countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea. We will pay a tiered royalty for net sales of product by it or any of its affiliates or sublicensees containing the licensed compound ranging from the high single digits to the low teens depending on net sales of products under the MIN-117 License Agreement. Through the date of the agreement, as amended, we were required to make payments up to $57.5 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones. 
 In January 2014, we renegotiated the structure of the license for MIN-117 such that we are required to make certain milestone payments upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones up to $47.5 million. In addition, in the event that we sell the rights to the license, MTPC will be entitled to a percentage of milestone payments in the low teens and a percentage of royalties received by us in the low double digits. This license agreement has a term of the later of 10 years from the launch of the product in each country in our territory, or the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties, upon which we will have a fully paid-up, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license. Our obligation to pay royalties continues, on a country-by-country basis, until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent that covers MIN-117 in each country in our territory. In April 2015, we amended the diligence milestone obligation under the license agreement for MIN-117 to extend the deadline from April 30, 2015 to June 30, 2015 to begin enrollment in a Phase 2a or Phase 2b study with MIN-117 in patients suffering major mood disorders. As consideration for the two-month extension, we paid MTPC, and recorded an expense for, $80,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015. We met the enrollment milestone obligation in June 2015.
 Seltorexant Co-Development and License Agreement with Janssen 
 On February 13, 2014, we signed a co-development and license agreement (the “Agreement”) with Janssen, which became effective upon completion of our initial public offering and the payment of a $22.0 million license fee. Under the Agreement, Janssen, the licensor, granted us an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, in the Minerva Territory, under (i) certain patent and patent applications to sell products containing any orexin 2 compound, controlled by the licensor and claimed in a licensor patent right as an active ingredient and (ii) seltorexant for any use in humans. In addition, upon regulatory approval in the Minerva Territory (and earlier if certain default events occur), we will have rights to manufacture seltorexant, also known as JNJ-42847922. We have granted to the licensor an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under all patent rights and know-how controlled by us related to seltorexant to sell seltorexant outside the Minerva Territory. In consideration of the licenses granted on July 7, 2014, we made a license fee payment of $22.0 million, which was included as a component of research and development expense in 2014. 
 The Agreement contains certain provisions, which include our ability to opt-out of the Agreement upon completion of certain milestones. If we elect to participate in the development program through to the potential commercial approval of seltorexant we will pay a quarterly royalty percentage to the licensor in the high single digits on aggregate net sales for seltorexant products sold by us, our affiliates and sublicensees in the Minerva Territory. The licensor will pay a quarterly royalty percentage to us in the high single digits on aggregate net sales for seltorexant products sold by the licensor outside the Minerva Territory. 
 We account for the Agreement as a joint risk-sharing collaboration in accordance with ASC 808, “Collaborative Arrangements”. Payments between us and the licensor with respect to each party’s share of seltorexant development costs that have been incurred 
 11


pursuant to the joint development plan are recorded within research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, as applicable, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations due to the joint risk-sharing nature of the activities. We have included zero in accrued collaborative expenses as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, related to the Agreement. In the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid zero and $2.5 million, respectively, related to development activities under the Agreement.
 On July 6, 2016, we and Janssen agreed that “Decision Point 2” had been reached as defined under the Agreement. As neither party exercised their right to withdraw from the Agreement, we paid Janssen $3.5 million and have incurred direct expenses of $0.3 million related to development activities under the current phase of development. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded expenses of zero and $11.2 million, respectively, for certain development activities in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
 In June 2017, we entered into an amendment (“the Amendment”) to the co-development and license agreement with Janssen dated February 13, 2014 (the “Agreement”). The effectiveness of the Amendment was contingent upon approval of its terms by the European Commission and the closing of the acquisition of Actelion Ltd. by affiliates of Janssen. These conditions were subsequently met, and the Amendment became effective on August 29, 2017. Under the Amendment, Janssen has waived its right to royalties on seltorexant insomnia sales in the Minerva Territory. We retain all of our rights to seltorexant, including commercialization of the molecule for the treatment of insomnia and as an adjunctive therapy for MDD, which include an exclusive license in the Minerva Territory, with royalties payable by us to Janssen on seltorexant sales outside of the insomnia indication. Royalties on sales outside of the Minerva Territory are payable by Janssen to us. Janssen made an upfront payment to us of $30 million upon the effectiveness of the Amendment and agreed to make a $20 million payment at the start of a Phase 3 insomnia trial for seltorexant and a $20 million payment when 50% of the patients are enrolled in this trial. Janssen further agreed to waive development payments from us until completion of the Phase 2b development milestone. This milestone is referred to as “Decision Point 4” and is expected to occur in the second half of 2019. The $30 million payment and $11.2 million in previously accrued collaborative expenses, which were forgiven upon the effective date of the Amendment, are earned and recognized as revenue as the services are performed from the commencement of Phase 3 development to the completion of the development activities using the proportional performance method. The $30 million payment along with the $11.2 million in previously accrued collaborative expenses have been included under deferred revenue on our balance sheet at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. In connection with the Amendment, we repurchased all of the approximately 3.9 million shares of our common stock previously owned by Johnson & Johnson Innovation-JJDC Inc. at a per share price of $0.0001, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $389.
 As a result of the Amendment, we assumed strategic control of matters relating to the clinical development of seltorexant for insomnia and have no further financial obligations until after Decision Point 4. After Decision Point 4, both we and Janssen have the right to opt-out of the Agreement.
 If we opt-out, we collect a royalty on worldwide sales of seltorexant in the single digits with no further obligations to Janssen. If Janssen opts-out, the Minerva Territory would be expanded to include North America and we would pay Janssen royalties on sales of seltorexant outside of the insomnia indication in the single digits. 
 If both parties elect to continue past Decision Point 4 into Phase 3, we would be obligated to fund the clinical trials related to insomnia, receive up to $40 million in milestone payments from Janssen, and be responsible for 40% of all costs incurred in the Phase 3 MDD program.
 Competition 
 Roluperidone: Competition in the Pharmaceutical Market for the Treatment of Schizophrenia 
 Current drug therapies for the treatment of schizophrenia mainly target the positive symptoms of the disease. When patients present positive symptoms and require treatment, they are typically given either conventional “first-generation” antipsychotic medication, such as GlaxoSmithKline’s Thorazine Sanofi-Aventis’ Largactil (chlorpromazine) and Johnson & Johnson’s Haldol (haloperidol), or second-generation “atypical antipsychotics,” such as Novartis’ Clozaril (clozapine), Johnson & Johnson’s Risperdal (risperidone), AstraZeneca’s Seroquel (quetiapine), Eli Lilly’s Zyprexa (olanzapine) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Abilify (aripiprazole). 
 Both types of existing therapies have limited ability to improve negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms. In addition, existing therapies have extensive side effects such as weight gain, metabolic syndrome, sedation, nausea, movement disorders, restlessness, insomnia, impairment of cognitive skills, and prolactin increase. Since schizophrenia has a wide range of symptoms, multiple therapeutics are often prescribed in an attempt to address all aspects of the disease, compounding these side effects. 
 12


Given the focus of currently approved drug therapies for positive symptoms and their side effect profiles, we believe these therapies are unlikely to be directly competitive with roluperidone, which is intended to target primarily negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. However, new drug therapies in addition to roluperidone are being developed to address the limitations of current therapies. Several new pharmacological approaches have been investigated. One targets a neurotransmitter called glutamate and the other targets a neurotransmitter called nicotine. Glutamate is the most predominant neurotransmitter system in maintaining the brain in an active state and is involved in maintaining accurate vigilance, attention and contributing to some cognitive skills. Nicotine is among the most predominant neurotransmitter system involved in learning and some other cognitive skills. On September 22, 2017, Allergan announced it had received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding their antipsychotic product, Vraylar. The FDA, according to Allergan’s press-release, determined that the supplemental NDA (“sNDA”) for the treatment of negative symptoms was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Allergan has stated that the company is in the process of planning a meeting with the FDA, to respond to the issues, and to seek clarification of what information will be required.
Specific compounds under late-stage development that include negative symptoms as a target include Acadia Pharmaceuticals’ Pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5HT2a inverse agonist (“SSIA”) that is approved for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis. In January 2019, Lundbeck indicated they would begin proof of concept studies for Lu AF11167, which has a treatment for persistent negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Other products in clinical development whose targets include negative symptoms (although not necessarily defined as a primary outcome of their clinical trials) are Roche’s RO6889450, Takeda’s TAK-831, SyneuRx’s NaBen, and Avanir Pharmaceuticals’ AVP-786.  
 MIN-117: Competition in the Pharmaceutical Market for the Treatment of MDD 
 The pharmaceutical market for the treatment of MDD is largely comprised of SSRIs, SNRIs and atypical antipsychotics. By the time of MIN-117’s estimated launch, if approved by the FDA, a number of these marketed antidepressants will be generic, and would be key competitors to MIN-117. These products include Forest’s Lexapro/Cipralex (escitalopram), Pfizer’s Zoloft (sertraline), GlaxoSmithKline’s Paxil/Seroxat (paroxetine), Eli Lilly’s Prozac (fluoxetine), Forest’s Viibryd (vilazodone), Pfizer’s Effexor (venlafaxine), Pfizer’s Pristiq (desvenlafaxine), Eli Lilly’s Cymbalta (duloxetine), AstraZeneca’s Seroquel (quetiapine) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Abilify (aripiprazole). 
 Both SSRIs and SNRIs have significant limitations. SSRIs may lead to varying levels of weight gain and the impairment in cognitive and sexual functions. In some cases, SNRIs have a worse safety and tolerability profile compared to SSRIs, in particular with respect to cardiovascular side effects. In addition, SSRIs and SNRIs are effective in only a part of the MDD patient population. Over one-third of patients fail to respond to two or more successive lines of antidepressant therapy. 
 Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) often require treatment with several antidepressants, such as an SSRI or SNRI, combined with an “adjunct” therapy such as an antipsychotic or mood stabilizer. These antipsychotic compounds, such as AstraZeneca’s Seroquel (quetiapine) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Abilify (aripiprazole), and mood stabilizers, such as Janssen Pharmaceuticals’ Topamax (topiramate), cause some slight improvements in efficacy but often have unacceptable side effects, including motor symptoms, sedation, lack of concentration, and weight gain. 
 MIN-117 may have a faster onset of action, fewer side effects than existing treatments, and could benefit non- or partial-responders, but a number of products in development could also compete with MIN-117. Lundbeck’s Vortioxetine (Brintellix), an SSRI with additional 5-HT receptor modulation activity, has been developed as a monotherapy and was recently approved by the FDA for use as a second-line therapy. Brintellix has been shown to have fewer side effects, in particular less impact on cognition, than existing therapies, though it does not show improved efficacy on depressive symptoms In addition, Janssen’s esketamine and Allergan’s rapastinel (formerly Naurex GLYX-13) both target the NMDA receptor and are expected to have a faster onset of therapeutic effect as compared to currently available therapies. 
 Seltorexant: Competition in the Pharmaceutical Market for the Treatment of Insomnia 
 Most of the pharmaceuticals on the market for insomnia target neurotransmitter pathways involved in depressing the brain activity, such as the histamine and GABA pathways, to induce a decrease in vigilance and attention, leading to sedation and sleep induction. The leading molecule among the current third generation of GABAergic drugs is Sanofi’s zolpidem, often marketed under the name Ambien, and is available in generic form. However, zolpidem requires careful utilization to avoid tolerance and drug abuse and extensive sleep studies have demonstrated that zolpidem does not restore physiological sleep and does not allow restorative sleep, which prevents good daytime performance. 
 Unlike existing therapies, seltorexant, if approved, is expected to inhibit wakefulness-promoting neurotransmitters, rather than activating sleep-promoting neurotransmitters. In August 2014, Merck & Co.’s dual orexin receptor antagonist, suvorexant, was approved by the FDA and is currently marketed under the name Belsomra®. We believe that Belsomra may be the only new insomnia 
 13


pharmaceutical product to launch significantly in advance of seltorexant’s launch. If approved, we believe seltorexant, which is a single orexin receptor antagonist that targets orexin 2 pathways only and has a different pharmacokinetic profile from Belsomra, may have equal or superior efficacy, less residual sedation and impaired daytime functioning, and superior preservation of appropriate levels of rapid eye movement sleep as compared to Belsomra. 
 MIN-301: Competition in the Pharmaceutical Market for the Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease 
 Current treatments for Parkinson’s disease are intended to improve the symptoms of patients. The cornerstone of Parkinson’s therapy is levodopa, as it is the most effective therapy for reducing symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. However, levodopa may cause unpleasant systemic side effects, such as dyskinesias, and is often used with dopaminergics to manage these side effects. While initially effective, symptoms become increasingly difficult to control over time, and patients experience a pattern of motor complications that include motor fluctuations, dyskinesias, off-period dystonia, freezing and falls. Accordingly, there are advantages to deferring their use to later stages of the disease, or using them with other therapies to reduce the side effects of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia that 50% of levodopa patients experience. 
 Unlike currently available therapies, MIN-301, if approved, is intended to delay the onset of the disease, slow or prevent the progression of the disease or reverse its effects. Since MIN-301 is expected to target Parkinson’s disease, rather than merely its symptoms, and current therapies are not fully effective at improving the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease without side effects, we believe that levodopa and other currently available generic products may not be directly competitive with MIN-301. While there are other drug therapies in development that will target the disease, such as gene and stem cell therapy and A2A receptor agonists, the majority of products in development for Parkinson’s disease are still in the pre-clinical stage. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary products and technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 The patent portfolios for our product candidates, which we own or are exclusively licensed to us, are summarized below. 
 Roluperidone 
 Compound 
 Under our agreement with MTPC, we have an exclusive license to U.S. Patent No. 7,166,617, which claims the roluperidone compound, as well as to corresponding patents in the following countries: Australia, Canada, Europe (Albania, Austria, Belgium, Republic of Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Monaco, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and United Kingdom), Israel, New Zealand, and Russia.

The granted U.S. patents, as well as any other U.S. or foreign patents that may grant from these applications, will expire no earlier than November 30, 2035. 
 In 2018, we filed a U.S. and PCT applications which claim gastro-resistant, controlled release dosage formulations of roluperidone.  The terms of any future granted patents in this patent family would expire no earlier than June 21, 2038. 
 Methods of Use 
 We own two granted patents in Russia, single patents in the U.S. and Europe (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and United Kingdom), and several pending applications in two patent families that are directed to methods of use of roluperidone to treat negative and other symptoms of schizophrenia, sleep disorders, depression, and other sigma-2 disorders or conditions. Applications from these 
 14


families are also currently pending in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Europe, and Russia. The term of the granted U.S. patent is scheduled to expire on January 17, 2033.  The foreign patents, as well as any future patents granting in these families, are scheduled to expire no earlier than July 20, 2031. 
 We also own U.S. and EP patent applications directed to the use of roluperidone to treat negative symptoms in non-schizophrenic patients. Any patents granting from these applications would expire no earlier than May 23, 2037.
 MIN-117
 Compound
 Under our agreement with MTPC, we have an exclusive license to U.S. Patent No. 6,720,320, which claims the MIN-117 compound, as well as to corresponding patents in Canada and Europe (Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and United Kingdom). The U.S. patent expires no earlier than August 13, 2020, and a patent term extension of up to 5 years may be available. The foreign patents are scheduled to expire no earlier than May 22, 2020.
Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Use 
 We own a granted patent in Australia and several pending applications directed to compositions comprising a low dose of MIN-117 and their use for treating depression, sleep disorders, and improving cognitive impairment in patients with depression. Applications in this family are also pending in the United States, Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, and South Africa. Patents that grant from these applications will expire no earlier than January 24, 2034. A patent term extension of up to five years may be available in the United States.
 We also own U.S. and EP patent applications directed to the use of MIN-117 to treat anxiety disorders. Any patents granting from these applications would expire no earlier than May 23, 2037.
 In 2018, we filed a provisional application in the U.S. directed to methods of treating pain comprising the administration of MIN-117.
 Seltorexant
 Compound 
 Under our agreement with Janssen, we are an exclusive licensee of European Patent EP2491038, which claims the seltorexant compound and was validated in 39 European countries. The terms of these patents will expire no earlier than October 21, 2030.
Methods of Use 
 We also have rights to a PCT application filed in 2017, which is directed to the use of seltorexant to treat depression.  National phase applications based upon this PCT application were filed in 2018, and the terms of any patents issuing from these applications will expire no earlier than March 9, 2037.
 MIN-301
 We own a patent family that is directed to the use of MIN-301 for treating neurologic and psychiatric diseases, including Parkinson’s disease. This patent family includes patents granted in Australia, Canada, Europe (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and United Kingdom), Japan, Mexico and Russia. Applications are pending in the United States, China, and Hong Kong. The terms of any existing and future granted patents in this family will expire no earlier than November 17, 2028. A patent term extension of up to five years may be available in the United States.
 Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 In addition to patent protection, our product candidates may also be eligible for data and marketing exclusivity protection in the U.S., EU and certain other countries. If this protection is available, no competitor may use the data in our marketing application to obtain marketing approval of a generic product during the exclusivity period. 
 15


For small molecules, such as roluperidone, seltorexant and MIN-117, the data and marketing exclusivity period is generally five years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU, measured from the FDA and EU approval dates, respectively. If MIN-301 is approved as a biologic product, it may be eligible for a data and marketing exclusivity period of twelve years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU. The data and marketing exclusivity periods in the U.S. and EU may be extended by 6 months of pediatric exclusivity if a qualifying pediatric study is performed.
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Our product candidates are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
Commercialization 
 We began to expand our internal capabilities related to commercial planning, strategic product development and product marketing in late 2017. Except for most of Asia, we have global commercialization rights for two of our product candidates, roluperidone and MIN-117, and European Union commercialization rights for seltorexant. We have worldwide rights for MIN-301. We believe that it will be possible for us to access European and, in the case of roluperidone, MIN-117 and MIN-301, other priority markets including the United States, Asia, and Latin America, through a focused, specialized sales force where the population dynamics would prove efficient. We may enter into sales, distribution or other marketing arrangements with third parties for priority markets or limited to certain territories for any of our drug candidates that obtain marketing approval. 
 Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization, either alone or through collaborations with third parties, in the United States, EU and Latin America to sell our product candidates. We believe that such an organization will be able to target the community of physicians who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. Additionally, we plan to engage fully with all key constituencies involved in treatment decisions, including payors, patients and others.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization in the European Union 
 In Europe, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must currently be submitted to the competent national regulatory authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which we intend to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with that country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is expected to take effect in 2019, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices and other applicable regulatory requirements and medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices. A clinical trial may only be undertaken subject to certain conditions. The relevant ethics committee must give its opinion, before a clinical trial commences, on any issue requested. Clinical trials information must be entered into a European database. There are strict requirements in relation to the labeling and packaging of our product candidates, the verification of compliance with the provisions on good clinical and manufacturing practice and the notification of adverse events and serious adverse reactions. 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may not market a medicinal product without marketing authorization. 
 There are four procedures for submitting a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in the EU: (i) the national procedure, (ii) the mutual recognition procedure, or MRP; (iii) the decentralized, or DCP and (iv) the centralized procedure, or CP. The submission strategy for a given product will depend on the nature of the product, the target indication(s), the history of the product, and the marketing plan. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products which are produced by biotechnology processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and orphans. Besides the products falling under the mandatory scope, the centralized procedure is also open for medicinal products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation i.e. new active substances or other medicinal products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation. 
 16


The centralized procedure leads to approval of the product in all 28 EU member states and in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, collectively referred to herein as the EEA. Submission of one MAA thus leads to one assessment process and one authorization that allows access to the market of the entire EEA. The process of the centralized procedure is triggered when the applicant submits an MAA to the EMA. The letter of intent also initiates the assignment of the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur, who are the two appointed members of the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, representing two EU member states. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP. At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the European Commission. If this is opinion favorable, the Commission may then adopt a decision to grant a marketing authorization. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of an MAA in no more than 150 days. This is usually when the product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation.
 When using the MRP or DCP, the applicant must select which and how many EU member states in which to seek approval. In the case of an MRP, the applicant must initially receive national approval in one EU member state. This will be the so-called reference member state, or RMS, for the MRP. Then, the applicant seeks approval for the product in other EU member states, the so-called concerned member states, or CMS, in a second step: the mutual recognition process. For the DCP, the applicant will approach all chosen member states at the same time. To do so, the applicant will identify the RMS that will assess the submitted MAA and provide the other selected member states with the conclusions und results of the assessment. 
 The European Union medicines rules expressly permit the EU Member States to adopt national legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale, supply or use of any medicinal product containing, consisting of or derived from a specific type of human or animal cell, such as embryonic stem cells. While the products we have in development do not make use of embryonic stem cells, it is possible that the national laws in certain EU Member States may prohibit or restrict us from commercializing our products, even if they have been granted an EU marketing authorization. 
 An innovator company enjoys a period of “data exclusivity” during which their pre-clinical and clinical trials data may not be referenced in the regulatory filings of another company (typically a generic company) for the same drug substance. 
 Data exclusivity in Europe is 8 years from the date of first authorization in Europe with an additional period of 2 years of “market exclusivity.” This is the period of time during which a generic company may not market an equivalent generic version of the originator’s pharmaceutical product. An additional 1 year may be obtained where the innovator company is granted a marketing authorization within the above 8-year period for a significant new indication for the relevant medicinal product. 
 The Pediatric Regulation provides that an application for a new marketing authorization must include the results of all trials performed and details of all information collected in compliance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, unless a deferral or waiver applies on the basis that pediatric use is not relevant - also the requirement can be deferred by agreement. 
 When the application for marketing authorization is made, the competent authority responsible for granting a marketing authorization must verify whether the application complies with the relevant requirements, including compliance with the agreed PIP. Assuming it does, the marketing authorization may be granted and the relevant results are included in the summary of product characteristics, or SmPC, for the product, along with a statement indicating compliance with the agreed PIP. The applicant then receives the six month extension to the SPC. It is not necessary for the product actually to be indicated for use in the pediatric population (for example, if the results show that that would not be appropriate). 
 U.S. FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. MIN-301, a peptide, may be regulated as a biologic and additionally subject to the Public Health Service Act. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to allow pending Investigational New Drug Applications, or INDs, and approve NDAs, withdrawal of a marketing approval, imposition of clinical holds or termination of clinical trials, or issuance of Warning or Untitled Letters, product recalls, product seizures, refusal to allow imports or exports total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties and criminal prosecution, including criminal fines and imprisonment. 
 17


FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves, among other things, pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and significant financial investment, and the actual time and cost required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease indicated for treatment. 
 Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, pharmacology, stability, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of pre-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, any available clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical trial protocol, among other items. Certain pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may be conducted after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not placed a clinical hold on the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Should FDA place a clinical hold on the IND, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial may begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, good clinical practices, or GCP, which include the ethical principles that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and that all trials be approved and monitored on an ongoing basis by an institutional review board, or IRB. Clinical trials must also be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. Each protocol involving testing in U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The study protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials, along with all amendments, must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target disease or condition, the drug is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited subject population with the target disease or condition to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, generally two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 trials. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results must also be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients, imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as United States export requirements. 
 The FDA may suspend or terminate a clinical trial, or impose other sanctions, at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if it believes that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects, or may impose other conditions on the conduct of the research. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects, and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. Sponsors may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on safety concerns, a lack of evidence of drug efficacy, evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Under federal law, the submission of most marketing applications is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved application is also subject to annual program fees.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a marketing application or supplement to a marketing application for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, either during the application process or after the approval of the drug to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks, and to identify any new risks that were not apparent in clinical investigations. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. The FDA has a goal of reviewing ninety percent of applications for non-priority drug products within 10 months of the FDA’s acceptance of the full application for filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA under certain circumstances. 
 Under the FDCA and FDA guidance, before approving a drug for which no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredients) has previously been approved by the FDA or a first-of-a-kind, first-in-class biologic, FDA must either refer that drug to an external advisory committee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why FDA did not refer the drug to an advisory committee. The external advisory committee review may also be required for other drugs because of certain other issues, including clinical trial design, safety and effectiveness, and public health questions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless the facility, and all of its subcontractors and contract manufacturers, demonstrate compliance with cGMPs, and provide adequate assurance that they can consistently produce the product within required specifications, and the NDA contains data that provides substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the indication sought in the proposed labeling. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs before approving a marketing application. After the FDA evaluates the marketing application and the manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter, or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA may issue an approval letter. 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, limitations on the approved indications, contraindications, warnings or precautions, such as black boxed warnings, distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, or new safety issues arise, a new or supplemental NDA or a post-implementation notification or other report may be required or requested depending on the change, which may require additional data or additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 19


Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product and drug shortages. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and may require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. 
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market trials or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 
 
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, Untitled Letters, Warning Letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of administrative civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications if in their professional medical judgment they believe it to be appropriate, pharmaceutical companies may only market and promote their drug products for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws prohibiting the marketing and promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly marketed or promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, among others, criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and mandatory compliance programs. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 Moreover, the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product and tracking and tracing. 
 In the European Union, holders of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, or QPPV, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new European marketing authorization applications must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-
 20


consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products, other federal and state healthcare laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. Applicable state anti-kickback and false claims laws may be broader in scope than federal law and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other sta
te programs. 
 We may also be subject to state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by the Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to healthcare providers and entities.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates, once approved. 
 Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be covered by third-party payors. The market for our product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Also, third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. A third-party payors’ decision to provide coverage for a medical product or service does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be obtained. 
 In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage. 
 Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care organizations, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents or biosimilars, judicial decisions and governmental laws related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We 
 21


cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain governmental or private third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. 
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. 
 In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, which substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may potentially reduce the profitability of products, including, for example, increased rebates for products sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. There have been judicial and congressional challenges to the ACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law, including the repeal, effective January 1, 2019, of the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate” and delays in the implementation of the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on imposed on certain non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the ‘‘donut hole.’’ More recently, in July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Congress could still consider other legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or portions of the ACA. Additionally, on December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act.  While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved. 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.

Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit”. Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union is expected to take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement to be negotiated by the parties or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provided the notice of withdrawal pursuant to the Treaty on European Union, or on March 29, 2019. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, immediately following Brexit, it is expected that the United Kingdom’s regulatory regime will remain aligned to European regulations. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom. In the longer term, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom.
