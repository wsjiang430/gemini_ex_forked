Item 1. Business
AZZ Inc. (“AZZ”, the “Company”, “our” or “we”) was established in 1956 and incorporated under the laws of the state of Texas. We are a global provider of galvanizing and metal coating services, welding solutions, specialty electrical equipment and highly engineered services to the power generation, transmission, distribution, refining and industrial markets. We have two distinct operating segments: the Energy segment and the Metal Coatings segment. AZZ Energy is dedicated to delivering safe and reliable transmission of power from generation sources to end customers, and automated weld overlay solutions for corrosion and erosion mitigation to critical infrastructure in the energy markets worldwide. AZZ Metal Coatings is a leading provider of metal finishing solutions for corrosion protection, including hot dip galvanizing to the North American steel fabrication industry.
Energy Segment
AZZ's Energy segment is a leading provider of specialized products and services designed to support industrial, nuclear and electrical applications. Our product offerings include custom switchgear, electrical enclosures, medium and high voltage bus ducts, explosion proof and hazardous duty lighting, nuclear safety-related equipment and tubular products. In addition to our product offerings, AZZ's Energy segment focuses on extension of life cycle for the power generation, refining and industrial infrastructure, through automated weld overlay solutions for corrosion and erosion mitigation. The markets for our Energy segment are highly competitive and consist of large multi-national companies, along with numerous small independent companies. Competition is based primarily on product quality, range of product line, price and service. While some of our competitors are much larger than us, our Energy segment offers some of the most technologically advanced solutions and engineering resources developed from a legacy of proven, reliable product options, allowing AZZ Energy to be ideally positioned to meet the most challenging application-specific demands.
Copper, aluminum, steel and nickel based alloys are the primary raw materials used by this segment. We do not foresee any availability issues for these materials. We do not contractually commit to minimum volumes and increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses to the customer’s contracts, which the customers may not accept. In addition, we seek to get firm pricing contracts from our vendors on these materials at the time we receive orders from our customers in order to minimize risk. 
We sell Energy segment products through manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, agents and our internal sales force. We are not dependent on any single customer for this segment, and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated revenues or net income.

On March 22, 2018, we purchased certain assets through a bankruptcy sales process from Lectrus Corporation, a privately-held corporation based in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Lectrus designs and manufactures custom metal enclosures and provides electrical and mechanical integration. The acquisition will complement our current metal enclosure and switchgear businesses.
On September 6, 2017, we completed the acquisition of all the assets and outstanding shares of Powergrid Solutions, Inc. ("PSI"), a privately held company, based in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. PSI designs, engineers and manufactures customized low and medium-voltage power quality, power generation and distribution equipment. PSI’s product portfolio includes metal-enclosed, metal-clad and padmount switchgear, serving the utility, commercial, industrial and renewable energy markets since 1982. The acquisition of PSI is a key addition to the Company's electrical switchgear portfolio. The addition of PSI’s low-voltage and padmount switchgear allows AZZ to offer a comprehensive portfolio of customized switchgear solutions to both existing and new customers in a diverse set of industries. 
On March 1, 2016, we completed an acquisition of the equity securities of Power Electronics, Inc. (“PEI”), a Millington, Maryland-based manufacturer and integrator of electrical enclosure systems. The acquisition of PEI will enhance our capacity to serve existing and new customers in a diverse set of industries along the Eastern seaboard of the United States.

Metal Coatings Segment
The Metal Coatings segment provides hot dip galvanizing and other metal coating applications to the steel fabrication industry through facilities located throughout the United States and Canada. Hot dip galvanizing is a metallurgical process in which molten zinc is applied to steel. The zinc alloying renders corrosion protection to fabricated steel for extended periods of up to 50 years. As of February 28, 2019, we operated forty-two metal coating plants, which are located in various locations throughout the United States and Canada.
Metal coating is a highly competitive business, and we compete with other galvanizing companies, captive galvanizing facilities operated by manufacturers, and alternate forms of corrosion protection such as material selection (stainless steel or aluminum) or barrier protections such as powder coating, paint, and weathering steel. Our galvanizing markets are generally limited to areas within relatively close proximity to our metal coating plants due to freight cost.
Zinc, the principal raw material used in the galvanizing process, is currently readily available, but is subject to volatile pricing. We manage our exposure to commodity pricing of zinc by utilizing agreements with zinc suppliers that include fixed costs contracts to guard against escalating commodity prices. We also secure firm pricing for natural gas supplies with individual utilities when possible. We may or may not continue to use these or other strategies to manage risk in the future.
We typically serve fabricators or manufacturers that provide solutions to the electrical and telecommunications, bridge and highway, petrochemical and general industrial markets, and numerous original equipment manufacturers. We do not depend on any single customer for a significant amount of our sales, and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated revenues or net income.
On February 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of all the assets and outstanding shares of Rogers Brothers Company ("Rogers Brothers"), a privately held company, based in Rockford, Illinois. Rogers Brothers provides galvanizing solutions to a multi-state area within the Midwest. The acquisition supports our goal of continued geographic expansion as well as portfolio expansion of our metal coatings solutions. 
On June 30, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Enhanced Powder Coating Ltd., (“EPC”), a privately held, high specification, National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program, ("NADCAP"), certified provider of powder coating, plating and anodizing services based in Gainesville, Texas. EPC, founded in 2003, offers a full spectrum of finish technology including powder coating, abrasive blasting and plating for heavy industrial, transportation, aerospace and light commercial industries. The acquisition of EPC is consistent with our strategic initiative to grow our Metal Coatings segment with products and services that complement our industry-leading galvanizing business.
For additional information on the Metal Coatings segment's operating results, see Results of Operations within Item 7. For additional financial information by segment, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Employees
As of February 28, 2019, the Company employed approximately 3,884 persons consisting of approximately 3,427 in the United States, approximately 200 in Canada, 216 in Europe, and 41 in other countries.
