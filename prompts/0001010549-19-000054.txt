Item 1.  Business

The Company is the successor-by-merger to Wespac Investors Trust, a California business trust that began operating in 1982.  On March 26, 1996, the name was changed to Greenbriar Corporation.

Recent Stock Issuance; Change in Control
 
Following its Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on October 10, 2018, and approval of such action by the stockholders and the NYSE American, the Company, on December 4, 2018, issued an additional 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock to Realty Advisors, Inc. (“RAI”) a related party, for cash of $4,500,000 to increase stockholders’ equity by $4,440,000 after issuance costs. The issuance of 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock resulted in a change in control of the Company, as RAI now owns approximately 59.6% of the outstanding Common Stock. As Gene S. Bertcher is an officer of the Company and of RAI, RAI is deemed to be an “Affiliate” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended). The issuance of the 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock to RAI increased the total number of shares issued and outstanding to 5,131,935 shares. From the proceeds of sale of the Common Stock, $4,000,000, were loaned to American Realty Investors, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“ARL”) a related party, which has its shares of Common Stock listed and traded on the NYSE on a short-term basis, maturing September 30, 2019, at an interest rate of 6% per annum, which interest rate is believed by management to be in excess of the amount and rate of interest that would be available from other sources. The Company anticipates utilizing such funds in the future for drilling expenses, acquisitions and working capital.
Oil and Gas Operations
 
The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Mountaineer State Energy, Inc. and Mountaineer State Operations, LLC, owns and operates oil and gas wells and mineral leases in Athens and Meigs Counties in Ohio and in Calhoun, Jackson and Roane Counties in West Virginia. The majority of our oil & gas operation was acquired through the acquisition of the Carl E. Smith Companies in 2008.  
 
As of December 31, 2018 the Company has 153 producing wells, 44 non-producing wells and related equipment and mineral leases covering approximately 20,000 acres.
 
Business Strategy
 
The Company is a Nevada corporation which owns and operates oil and gas wells in Ohio and West Virginia.
 
The Company intends to continue to pursue acquisition of undervalued or distressed oil and gas related businesses, as well as additional acquisitions of oil and gas leases.  The Company may choose to develop or resell the acquired acreage as management deems most beneficial to the Company. The Company’s strategy is dependent on available financing as well as the market price for oil and gas.

 Insurance
 
The Company currently maintains property and liability insurance intended to cover claims in its oil and gas operations, retirement community and corporate operations.  The provision of personal services entails an inherent risk of liability compared to more institutional long-term care communities.  The Company also carries property insurance on each of its owned and leased properties, as appropriate.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company employed the services of 6 people with the remainder of the work contracted to third parties. The Company believes it maintains good relationships with its employees.  None of the Company’s employees are represented by a collective bargaining group.
 
The Company’s operations are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Many of the Company’s employees are paid at rates related to the minimum wage and any increase in the minimum wage will result in an increase in labor costs.
 
Management is not aware of any non-compliance by the Company as regards applicable regulatory requirements that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
 
Quality Assurance
 
Energy Philosophy – The Company is committed to the preservation and enhancement of the environment in which we operate.  We are philosophically and operationally focused to continually prioritize the sensitivity of our ecological system in which we develop resources for our generation as well as our children’s.  Management’s legacy is to prove that the energy industry can develop the earth’s natural resources with clean and efficient technologies while preserving its fragile beauty.  Our technologies directly and significantly reduce the impact of our operations on nature and wildlife by minimizing surface disturbance.
Regular Property Inspections – Property inspections are conducted by corporate personnel.  These inspections cover the appearance of the exterior and grounds, the appearance and cleanliness of the interior, the professionalism and friendliness of staff and notes on maintenance.
Marketing
 
The Company sells its oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers. While there is an available market for crude oil and natural gas production, we cannot be assured that the loss of these purchasers would not have a material impact on the Company. Further a reduction in the market price for oil and gas will have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position.
Government Regulation
 
Management is not aware of any non-compliance by the Company of applicable regulatory requirements that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
Competition
 
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive.  We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel.  Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and personnel substantially larger than ours.  As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit.
 
We are also affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment.  In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and has caused significant price increases.  We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may again occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation program.
 
Competition is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, undeveloped leases and drilling rights, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete satisfactorily.  Many large oil companies have been actively marketing some of their existing producing properties for sale to independent producers.  We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and submit bids as part of our growth strategy.
