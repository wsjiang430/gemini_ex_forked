Reportable Segments
We operate our business in four geographic segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. Each segment consists primarily of retail operations, with the significant majority of our stores engaged in the sale of new and pre-owned video game systems, software and accessories. As of February 2, 2019, we had a total of 5,830 stores across all of our segments; United States (3,846), Canada (311), Australia (462) and Europe (1,211). Our video game brands operate primarily under the names GameStopTM (“GameStop”), EB GamesTM (“EB Games”) and Micromania. We operate e-commerce sites under the brand names of GameStop, EB Games, Micromania and ThinkGeek. Our video game brands stores sell various types of digital products, including downloadable content, network points cards, prepaid digital, prepaid subscription cards and digitally downloadable software and also sell collectible products.

Our segments also include 103 pop culture themed stores selling collectibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys and other retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers, with 62 collectibles stores in international markets operating under the Zing Pop Culture brand and 41 stores in the United States operating under the ThinkGeek brand. Our video game brands also include Game InformerTM (“Game Informer”) magazine, the world's leading print and digital video game publication.
Our former Technology Brands segment had been comprised of Spring Mobile, Simply Mac and Cricket Wireless branded stores ("Cricket Wireless"). Cricket Wireless was sold in January 2018 and Spring Mobile was sold in January 2019.

Financial information about our segments is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 16, "Segment Information," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Market Size
Based upon estimates compiled by various market research firms, including NPD Group, Inc. ("NPD"), International Development Group ("IDG") and DFC Intelligence ("DFC"), we estimate that the market for new physical video game products was approximately $18 billion in 2018 in the countries in which we operate. This estimated market excludes sales of pre-owned video game products, which are not currently measured by any third-party research firms. Additionally, based on estimates compiled by various market research firms, we estimate that the market in North America for content in digital format (full-game and add-on content downloads for console and PC, subscriptions, mobile games and social network games) was between $25 billion and $32 billion in 2018.
Merchandise
We categorize our sale of products and services as follows:

• | New Video Game Hardware. We offer video game platforms from the major manufacturers. The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 4 (2013), Microsoft Xbox One (2013) and the Nintendo Switch (March 2017). In 2016, Sony and Microsoft released refreshes to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, respectively. In November 2017, Microsoft released a further enhanced version of its current generation console, the Xbox One X. We also offer extended service agreements. Video game hardware sales are generally driven by the introduction of new platform technology and the reduction in price points as platforms mature. 


• | New Video Game Software. We offer new video game software for current and certain prior generation consoles from the leading manufacturers, including Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, as well as all other major third-party game publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. We are one of the largest retailers of video game titles sold by these publishers. We carry new video game software across a variety of genres, including sports, action, strategy, adventure/role playing and simulation. 


• | Pre-owned and Value Video Game Products. We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade in their pre-owned video game products in our stores in exchange for store credits which can be applied towards the purchase of other products, primarily new merchandise. We believe this process drives our higher market share, particularly at launch. We resell these pre-owned video game products and have the largest selection of pre-owned video game titles. In the U.S., pre-owned video game software titles have an average price of $17, compared to an average price of $48 for new video game software titles, and generate significantly higher gross margins than new video game products. Our trade-in program also allows us to be one of the only suppliers of previous generation platforms and related video games. We also operate refurbishment centers in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, where defective video game products can be tested, repaired, relabeled, repackaged and redistributed back to our stores. 


• | Video Game Accessories. Video game accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, virtual reality products, memory cards and other add-ons for use with video game hardware and software. 


• | Digital. The proliferation of online game play through Microsoft Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network and PC gaming websites has led to consumer demand for subscription, time and points cards (“digital currency”) as well as full-game downloads and digitally downloadable content (“DLC”), for existing console video games. We sell a wide variety of digital currency, and we have developed technology to sell DLC and full-game downloads in our stores and on our U.S. website. We believe we are the worldwide leading retailer of digital currency and DLC for Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network. 


• | Collectibles. Collectibles consist of licensed merchandise, primarily related to the video game, television and movie industries and pop culture themes which are sold through our video game stores, ThinkGeek stores, Zing Pop Culture stores and www.thinkgeek.com. 

2


• | Other Products. Other products primarily consist of PC entertainment software, gaming-related print media, mobile and consumer electronics, and revenues from PowerUp Pro loyalty members receiving Game Informer magazine in print form. We offer PC entertainment software from many of the largest PC publishers, including Electronic Arts, Take Two and Activision Blizzard across a variety of genres, including sports, action, strategy, adventure/role playing and simulation. We also carry strategy guides, magazines and interactive game figures, such as Amiibos from Nintendo. 

Store Operations
We design our video game stores to provide an electronic gaming atmosphere with an engaging and visually captivating layout, with an average size of 1,700 square feet. Our video game stores are typically equipped with several video game sampling areas, which provide our customers the opportunity to play games before purchase, as well as equipment to play video game clips. We use store configuration, in-store signage and product demonstrations to produce marketing opportunities both for our vendors and for us.
Our stores are generally located in high-traffic “power strip centers,” local neighborhood strip centers, high-traffic shopping malls and pedestrian areas, primarily in major metropolitan areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers.
Site Selection and Locations
Site Selection.  Site selections for new stores are made after an extensive review of demographic data, including data from our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program, and other information relating to market potential, competitor access and visibility, compatible nearby tenants, accessible parking, location visibility, lease terms and the location of our other stores. In each of our segments, we have a dedicated staff of real estate personnel experienced in selecting store locations.

PowerUp Rewards
We operate loyalty programs in each of the countries in which we operate our Video Game Brands stores. Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp RewardsTM ("PowerUp Rewards"), had approximately 39.6 million members as of February 2, 2019, of which approximately 16.2 million members have purchased at GameStop in the past year. The PowerUp Rewards membership totals also include 5.6 million paying members and 20.5 million members that we market to on a regular basis. Our loyalty programs in our video game stores in the remaining countries had approximately 20.9 million members as of February 2, 2019. Our loyalty programs generally offer our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership which gives our customers access to exclusive video game related rewards. The programs' paid memberships may also include a subscription to Game Informer magazine, additional discounts on pre-owned merchandise in our stores and additional credit on trade-ins of pre-owned products.
Game Informer
We publish Game Informer, the world’s largest print and digital video game publication and website featuring reviews of new title releases, game tips and news regarding current developments in the video game industry. Print and digital versions of the monthly magazine are sold through subscriptions, digitally and through displays in our domestic and international stores. Game Informer magazine is the fifth largest consumer publication in the U.S. and for its December 2018 issue, the magazine had approximately 6.6 million paid subscribers, including more than 2.1 million paid digital magazine subscribers. The digital version of the magazine is the largest subscription digital magazine in the United States. Game Informer is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program and is a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards membership. Operating results from the English version of Game Informer are included in the United States segment as this represents where the majority of subscriptions and sales are generated. Other international version results from Game Informer operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated.
Vendors
We purchase substantially all of our new products worldwide from approximately 100 manufacturers, software publishers and several distributors. Purchases from the top ten vendors in our Video Game Brands segments accounted for approximately 78% of our new product purchases in fiscal 2018. Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Take-Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard accounted for 23%, 22%, 10%, 6% and 4%, respectively, of our new product purchases in our video game brands during fiscal 2018. We have established price protections with our primary video game product vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. 
4

In addition, we have few purchase contracts with video game trade vendors and generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We purchase collectibles merchandise from a broad base of domestic and international vendors. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion. We believe that we have very good relationships with our vendors.
Distribution and Information Management
Our operating strategy involves providing a broad merchandise selection to our customers as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible. We use our distribution facilities and inventory management systems to maximize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores, enhance store efficiency and optimize store in-stock and overall investment in inventory.
Competition
The video game industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and PC software specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; the online environments operated by Sony (PlayStation Network), Microsoft (XBox Live), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch Online), as well as other online retailers and game rental companies. Video game products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers.
In the U.S., we compete with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”); Target Corporation (“Target”); Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon.com”); and Best Buy Co., Inc. (“Best Buy”), among others. Throughout Europe we compete with Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and major consumer electronics retailers such as Media Markt, Saturn and FNAC, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, and online retailer Amazon.com. Competitors in Canada include Wal-Mart and Best Buy. In Australia, competitors include K-Mart, Target and JB HiFi stores.
Seasonality
Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2018 and 2017, we generated approximately 37% and 39%, respectively, of our sales during the fourth quarter.
Trademarks 
We have a number of trademarks and servicemarks, including “GameStop,” “Game Informer,” “EB Games,” “Electronics Boutique,” “ThinkGeek,” “Zing Pop Culture,” “Power to the PlayersTM” and “PowerUp Rewards,” which have been registered by us with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For many of our trademarks and servicemarks, including “Micromania,” we also have registered or have registrations pending with the trademark authorities throughout the world. We maintain a policy of pursuing registration of our principal marks and opposing any infringement of our marks.
Employees
We have approximately 16,000 full-time salaried and hourly employees and between 23,000 and 45,000 part-time hourly employees worldwide, depending on the time of year. Fluctuation in the number of part-time hourly employees is due to the seasonality of our business. We believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. Some of our international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, while none of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are members of a collective bargaining unit.
Sustainability
We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in program, we take in software (CDs), gaming consoles and consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In 2018 alone, through our U.S. refurbishment center, the company refurbished over five million pieces of software (CDs) and over three million consumer electronic devices, and recycled over 2.7 million pounds of e-waste. In addition, we continuously measure, and look for cost-effective ways to reduce, our carbon emissions and have seen both our total emissions and emissions by store decrease over the past seven years. See the Social Responsibility section of our corporate website (http://news.gamestop.com) for further information on our sustainability efforts.
