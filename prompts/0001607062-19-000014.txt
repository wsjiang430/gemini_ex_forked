The Company was originally incorporated in Colorado in April 1991 under the name Snow Runner (USA), Inc. The Company was the general partner of Snow Runner (USA) Ltd.; a Colorado limited partnership to sell proprietary snow skates under the name "Sled Dogs" which was dissolved in August 1992. In late 1993, the Company relocated its operations to Minnesota and in January 1994 changed our name to Snow Runner, Inc. In November 1994 we changed our name to the Sled Dogs Company. On November 5, 1997, we filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In September 1998, we emerged from protection of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In May, 1999, we changed our state of domicile to Nevada and our name to XDOGS.COM, Inc. On July 22, 2005, the Board of Directors and a majority of the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to change the Company's name to Avalon Oil & Gas, Inc., and to increase the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 200,000,000 shares to 1,000,000,000 shares par value of $0.001, and engage in the acquisition of producing oil and gas properties.

We filed an amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State on April 10, 2013, to increase our authorized shares to 200,000,000.

Corporate Strategy
 
Our Company’s new name reflects our new corporate direction as a consumer health products company dedicated to improving people’s health and well-being. We will assemble a portfolio of assets via royalty agreements, equity investments, and licensing agreements, as well as develop our own proprietary CB3 skin care products. Our products will contain premium hemp extracts with a broad range of cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD). CBD is a cannabinoid compound naturally derived from the hemp plant. It is not a drug and has no intoxicating effects, but has a long history of natural uses. Recent breakthroughs in research have shown the powerful health benefits of CBD on the body. CBD is also rich in vitamins A, B, D, and E, antioxidants, and fatty acids, all of which dramatically improve skin health. When applied topically to the skin, CBD has been shown to reduce inflammation, retain skin moisture levels, reduce cellular damage, inhibit oil production leading to breakouts, and protect skin from free radicals that damage collagen and elastin.
 
We have partnered with top leaders in CBD research, cultivation, and extraction to create the world’s finest cannabis skincare product line. Our Groove Botanicals, Inc. proprietary CB3 launches with three foundational products: Revita Wash, a gentle yet effective daily wash that removes toxins and smooths skin; Phyto Lotion, a light-weight, long-lasting daily moisturizer that hydrates, softens, and protects; and Eye Matter, a powerfully effective eye cream that diminishes dark circles, puffiness, expression lines, and wrinkles. Together, these products offer a minimalist skincare routine designed to deliver immediate and transformative results to all skin types. We are also proud to say that our products are 100% American made and non-toxic, paraben free, sulfate free, artificial fragrance free, dye free, vegan, animal by-product free, and 100% pet friendly. We look forward to announcing further developments in the coming months as we expand and develop both our CBD skin care line and our other innovative new product lines.

In furtherance of the foregoing strategy, we have engaged in the following transactions during the last three years:
 
On June 14, 2017, the Company sold its interest in Lipscomb County, Texas.
 
On July 22, 2017, the Company abandoned its properties in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. 
 
On December 28, 2017, the Company sold its properties in Custer County, Oklahoma.
 
We will continue to evaluate the market value of our oil and gas properties.
 
On March 21, 2018 the Board of Directors and a majority of the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to change the Company's name to Groove Botanicals, Inc. and an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation was filed with the State of Nevada on May 18, 2018 to change the name of our Company. 
 
On May 14, 2018, we changed our stock symbol to GRVE.
 
We plan to raise additional capital during the coming fiscal year, but currently have not identified additional funding sources. Our ability to continue operations is highly dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing, or generate revenues from the sale of our CBD skincare products, none of which can be guaranteed.
 
Ultimately, our success is dependent upon our ability to generate revenues from the sale our CBD skincare products, and to achieve profitability, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including general economic conditions. There is no assurance that even with adequate financing or combined operations, we will generate revenues and be profitable.
