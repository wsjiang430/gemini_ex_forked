Our Business
 
Iconic Brands is a beverage company that develops, from inception to completion, alcoholic beverages for itself and third parties. Iconic Brands also markets and places the products into national distribution through long standing industry relationships. Iconic is also a leader in “Celebrity Branding” of beverages, procuring superior and unique products from around the world and branding its products with internationally recognized celebrities. 
 
BiVi LLC produces and markets BiVi 100 percent Sicilian Vodka. BiVi LLC’s mission is to promote and support the sales endeavors of the distribution network through targeted and national marketing endeavors and working with the celebrity partner Mr. Chazz Palminteri. 
 
Bellissima Spirits LLC entered into a License Agreement with Christie Brinkley, Inc. an entity owned by Christie Brinkley, to use Brinkley’s endorsement, signature, and other intellectual property owned by Bellissima Spirits LLC. Bellissima by Christie Brinkley is a line of Organic Prosecco. The line includes a DOC Brut, Sparkling Rose and a Zero Sugar, Zero Carb option which are All Natural and Gluten Free with all Certified Organic and Vegan. 
 
Bellissima Spirits LLC produces it products in Treviso, Italy. The products are produced at a winery that has invested an enormous amount of time and financial resources to produce and deliver Bellissima Prosecco and Sparkling Wines. We have a “one stop” shop with our winery partners and they manage all of the procurement of all raw materials required to produce a finished product of either the DOC Brut, Sparkling Rose Pinot Grigio and our Zero Sugar, Zero Carb Sparkling Wine Expression.
 
We distribute all of our products through United Spirits Inc. (“United Sprits”), a variable interest entity of the Company, pursuant to a Distribution Agreement. United Spirits distributes and wholesales our products and is our licensed importer and wholesaler. The Distribution Agreement provides United Spirits the exclusive right through 2025 to sell our products for an agreed distribution fee equal to $1.00 per case of product sold. United Spirits holds all state and federal licenses to distribute the our products. 
 
Our products are produced overseas and shipped to the United States by United Spirits, either directly to its distributors or to United Spirits’ warehouse. Products that are shipped to the warehouse are then shipped via ground freight to wholesalers or distributors to fulfill orders as they are placed.
 
By law, United Spirits can only sell our alcoholic products to a licensed United States wholesaler or distributor. Wholesalers and distributors then sell the product to licensed retailers for “on” or “off” premise consumption. An “on” premise retailer is an establishment where the alcohol is consumed, such as a bar or restaurant. An “off” premise retailer is an establishment where alcohol is sold for consumption elsewhere, such as a liquor store or, in some state jurisdictions, a supermarket.

One of United Spirits’ distributors, Southern Glazer’s Wine and Spirits, LLC, purchased a $2.1 million order during the fourth quarter of 2017 for sales to Publix Supermarkets. The order was related to a holiday program, and it was authorized for all of Publix’s seven markets: Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. The program featured Bellissima Prosecco and Sparkling Wines in all Publix stores for the 2017 holiday season. The brand also was featured as the “BOGO” (Buy One Get One) brand in Publix's circular that ran in early January 2018. As a condition of being included in the promotion, the Company was required to provide a $597,138 rebate for each product sold during this promotion. Note, we do not sell directly to Publix or any retail licensee. All of our sales must be made through United Spirits to wholesalers and distributors, who then distribute to retailers.
 
We intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in one or more business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of a publicly held corporation.
 
Competition
 
The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength. Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitors include La Marca Prosecco owned by Gallo, Mionetto and a large number of independent small importers with a significant number of competitive products. We also compete with Diageo, the largest drinks company in the world, and others such as Constellation Brands, William Grant and Sons and Jim Beam Brands to name a few. 
 
With the release of our new line of Aperitis, “Bella Sprizz” we are in direct competition with Gruppo Campari the producer of Aperol. The Elderflower version of Bella Sprizz is competing with the category Leader St. Germain. Management is confident that with our very aggressive price point on the Bella Sprizz Line coupled with the incredible packaging and liquid quality we will quickly carve our niche in the category.

Governmental Regulation of the Wine Industry
 
The production and sale of wine is subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and state liquor commissions and agencies. 
 
In addition, most states in which our wines are sold impose varying excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages. Prompted by growing government budget shortfalls and public reaction against alcohol abuse, government entities often consider legislation that could potentially affect the taxation of alcoholic beverages. Excise tax rates being considered are often substantial. The ultimate effects of such legislation, if passed, cannot be assessed accurately. Any increase in the taxes imposed on wines can be expected to have a potentially adverse impact on overall sales of such products. However, the impact may not be proportionate to that experienced by distributors of other alcoholic beverages and may not be the same in every state.
 
The agreements we have in place with United Spirits and Dan Kay International provide the required licensing conduits that allow us to capture the sales relative to alcoholic beverages in the United States. The United States alcohol beverage business is based upon what is known as a “three-tier system.” The three tiers consist of an import or supplier tier if the product is domestically produced. The second tier is the wholesale tier. The third tier is known as the retail tier, consisting of an on and off premise split. The import/supply tier sells to the wholesale tier that then sells to the retail tier.
 
United Spirits possesses the import/supply tier licensing as well as the required licenses in the states where we sell alcoholic beverages to the wholesale tier. We have contracted with United Spirits to facilitate the sales of the products using the licensing United Spirits has in place. This is a common third party provider relationship in the United States alcohol beverage business. 
 
Dan-Kay International is the company that we contract warehousing services for the alcohol beverage products that come to rest in the United States. Dan-Kay maintains a required New York State warehousing license. This license has a level allowing the third party warehousing classified as “product of others.”
 
Employees
 
As of the date hereof, we have one operations employee in addition to our officers and directors Our officers and directors will continue to work for us for the foreseeable future. We anticipate hiring appropriate personnel on an as-needed basis, and utilizing the services of independent contractors as needed.
