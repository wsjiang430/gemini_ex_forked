Item 1.    Business. 
Arrow Electronics, Inc. (the "company" or "Arrow") is a global provider of products, services, and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing solutions. The company has one of the world’s broadest portfolios of product offerings available from leading electronic components and enterprise computing solutions suppliers, coupled with a range of services, solutions, and tools that help industrial and commercial customers introduce innovative products, reduce their time to market, and enhance their overall competitiveness. Arrow was incorporated in New York in 1946 and serves over 200,000 customers.
Arrow's diverse worldwide customer base consists of original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), value-added resellers ("VARs"), Managed Service Providers ("MSPs"), contract manufacturers ("CMs"), and other commercial customers. These customers include manufacturers of industrial equipment (such as machine tools, factory automation, and robotic equipment) and consumer products serving industries ranging from telecommunications, automotive and transportation, aerospace and defense, medical, professional services, and alternative energy, among others.
The company has two business segments, the global components business and the global enterprise computing solutions ("ECS") business. The company distributes electronic components to OEMs and CMs through its global components business segment and provides enterprise computing solutions to VARs and MSPs through its global ECS business segment. For 2018, approximately 70% of the company's sales were from the global components business segment, and approximately 30% of the company's sales were from the global ECS business segment. The financial information about the company's business segments and geographic operations is found in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The company maintains over 300 sales facilities and 49 distribution and value-added centers, serving over 80 countries. Both business segments have operations in each of the three largest electronics markets; the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); and Asia Pacific regions. Through this network, Arrow guides innovation forward by helping its customers deliver new technologies, new materials, new ideas, and new electronics that impact the business community and consumers. 
The company's financial objectives are to grow sales faster than the market, increase the markets served, grow profits faster than sales, and increase return on invested capital. To achieve its objectives, the company seeks to capture significant opportunities to grow across products, markets, and geographies. To supplement its organic growth strategy, the company continually evaluates strategic acquisitions to broaden its product and value-added service offerings, increase its market penetration, and expand its geographic reach.
Global Components
Global components markets and distributes electronic components and provides a comprehensive range of value-added capabilities throughout the entire life cycle of technology products and services. The company provides customers with the ability to deliver the latest technologies to the market through design engineering, global marketing and integration, global logistics, and supply chain management. The company offers the convenience of accessing, from a single source, multiple technologies and products from its suppliers with rapid or scheduled deliveries. Additionally, the company offers expertise in sustainable technology solutions to guide enterprise customers through the entire technology life cycle. Most of the company's customers require delivery of their orders on schedules or volumes that are generally not available on direct purchases from manufacturers. 
Within the global components business segment, net sales of approximately 68% consist of semiconductor products and related services; approximately 19% consist of passive, electro-mechanical, and interconnect products, consisting primarily of capacitors, resistors, potentiometers, power supplies, relays, switches, and connectors; approximately 10% consist of computing and memory; and approximately 3% consist of other products and services. 
Over the past three years, the global components business segment completed 6 strategic acquisitions to broaden its digital capabilities to meet the evolving needs of customers and suppliers. These acquisitions also expanded the global components business segment's portfolio of products and services offerings at every phase of technology deployment, including custom hardware and software, and new Internet of Things based business models. 
Global ECS
The company's global ECS business segment is a leading value-added provider of comprehensive computing solutions and services. Global ECS’ portfolio of computing solutions includes data-center, cloud, security, and analytics solutions. Global ECS brings broad market access, extensive supplier relationships, scale, and resources to help its VARs and MSPs meet the needs of their end-users. Global ECS works with VARs and MSPs to tailor complex IT solutions for their end-users. Customers have access to various services including engineering and integration support, warehousing and logistics, marketing resources, and authorized hardware and software training. Global ECS’ suppliers benefit from demand creation, speed to market, and efficient supply chain management. 
Within the global ECS business segment, net sales of approximately 39% consist of software, 37% consist of storage, 12% consist of industry standard servers, 6% consist of proprietary servers, and 6% consist of other products and services. 
Over the past three years, the global ECS business segment completed two strategic acquisitions to further expand its portfolio of products. Aligned with the vision of guiding innovation forward in the IT channel, the company is investing in emerging and adjacent markets, such as managed services and unified computing, within the ECS business.
Customers and Suppliers
The company and its affiliates serve over 200,000 industrial and commercial customers. Industrial customers range from major OEMs and CMs to small engineering firms, while commercial customers primarily include VARs, MSPs, and OEMs. No single customer accounted for more than 2% of the company's 2018 consolidated sales.
The company’s sales teams focus on an extensive portfolio of products and services to support customers’ material management and production needs, including connecting customers to the company’s field application engineers that provide technical support and serve as a gateway to the company’s supplier partners. The company’s sales representatives generally focus on a specific customer segment, particular product lines or a specific geography, and provide end-to-end product offerings and solutions with an emphasis on helping customers introduce innovative products, reduce their time to market, and enhance their overall competitiveness.
Substantially all of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. As such, the nature of the company's business does not provide visibility of material forward-looking information from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months.
No single supplier accounted for more than 10% of the company's consolidated sales in 2018. The company believes that many of the products it sells are available from other sources at competitive prices. However, certain parts of the company's business, such as the company's global ECS business segment, rely on a limited number of suppliers with the strategy of providing focused support, extensive product knowledge, and customized service to suppliers and VARs. Most of the company's purchases are pursuant to distributor agreements, which are typically non-exclusive and cancelable by either party at any time or on short notice.
Distribution Agreements
Certain agreements with suppliers protect the company against the potential write-down of inventories due to technological change or suppliers' price reductions. These contractual provisions typically provide certain protections to the company for product obsolescence and price erosion in the form of return privileges, scrap allowances, and price protection. Under the terms of the related distributor agreements and assuming the company complies with certain conditions, such suppliers are required to credit the company for reductions in suppliers' list prices. As of December 31, 2018, this type of arrangement covered approximately 49% of the company's consolidated inventories. In addition, under the terms of many such agreements, the company has the right to return to the supplier, for credit, a defined portion of those inventory items purchased within a designated period of time. 
A supplier, which elects to terminate a distribution agreement, may be required to purchase from the company the total amount of its products carried in inventory. As of December 31, 2018, this type of repurchase arrangement covered approximately 54% of the company's consolidated inventories. 
While these inventory practices do not wholly protect the company from inventory losses, the company believes that they currently provide substantial protection from such losses.
Competition
The company operates in a highly competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower markets, products, or particular sectors. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company's competitors vary across markets sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company's competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography served that creates pricing pressure and the need to continually improve services. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer.
The company also faces competition from companies entering or expanding into the logistics and product fulfillment, electronic catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company seeks to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors.
The company believes that it is well equipped to compete effectively with its competitors in all of these areas due to its comprehensive product and service offerings, highly-skilled work force, and global distribution network.
Employees
The company and its affiliates employed approximately 20,100 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2018.
