Item 1. Business
Overview
PROS provides artificial intelligence ("AI") solutions that power commerce in the digital economy by providing fast, frictionless and personalized buying experiences. PROS cloud solutions enable dynamic buying experiences for both business-to-business ("B2B") and business-to-consumer ("B2C") companies across industry verticals. Companies can use our dynamic pricing optimization, sales effectiveness, revenue management and commerce solutions to assess their market environments in real time to deliver customized prices and offers. Our solutions enable buyers to move fluidly across our customers’ direct sales, online, mobile and partner channels with personalized experiences regardless of which channel buyers choose. Our decades of data science and AI expertise are infused into our solutions and are designed to reduce time and complexity through actionable intelligence. We provide standard configurations of our solutions based on the industries we serve and offer professional services to configure our solutions to meet the specific needs of each customer.
We deliver our cloud-based solutions through the internet as a service on a subscription basis. Our subscription services are designed to achieve high levels of security, scalability, performance and availability. We believe our cloud solutions allow our customers to reduce their initial investment in third-party software, hardware, and administration requirements over traditional enterprise software, and also allow smaller customers or business units to cost-effectively leverage our enterprise class infrastructure, infrastructure management, security and other strategic services. In addition, as we manage all updates and upgrades of software deployed on the PROS cloud on behalf of our customers, we are able to provide our customers with our latest product innovations in a more uniform way. Over time, we believe that this model will require us to support fewer old versions of our software solutions, which would allow our product development team to focus more effort on creating innovative enhancements to our existing products and developing new products. 
Before 2015, we primarily offered on-premise license solutions, for which our customers purchased the perpetual right to use our software within a specific license scope. The vast majority of these license customers also purchased software maintenance and support, which includes unspecified software updates and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, maintenance releases, and patches released during the term of the support period.
Our Industry
Data-driven decision making is an important driver of business performance in the digital economy. Rapidly changing markets and buyer expectations make it increasingly harder for companies to grow. In response to these pressures, we believe that market forces, including increasingly dynamic and complex business models, the explosion of e-commerce, and the exponential 
2

increase in the volume of enterprise and market data will accelerate the demand for software solutions that enable companies to dynamically price, configure and sell their products and services across all their channels with speed, precision and consistency. We believe the market for solutions that can power commerce using AI and machine learning is a large, growing market that spans most major industries.
Our Solutions
Our cloud-based software solutions provide companies with AI-based predictive and prescriptive guidance on key business decisions that drive growth and profitability, including product mix optimization, price forecasting, price optimization, product configuration recommendations, new sales opportunity recommendations, cross-sell recommendations and proactive attrition detection. These insights are derived from machine learning data science based on historic customer transactions, external market inputs and other data. Our B2B cloud solutions enable a consistent buyer experience across direct, partner and eCommerce channels to support digital selling, and consist of Control (including a Real-Time Pricing Engine), Guidance, Opportunity Detection and Smart CPQ. Our B2C solutions for the travel industry include Revenue Management, Real-Time Dynamic Pricing, Group Sales, Shopping and Merchandising. Our solutions help to increase visibility, business agility and customer engagement by aligning sales and pricing strategy across go-to-market channels. As a result, our solutions make it easier for companies to configure the correct product(s), set the right price and quickly get a quote into the hands of a buyer.
Solutions for Selling Improvement
PROS selling solutions accelerate sales team's performance by automating sales processes with a rich eCommerce experience and infusing AI and machine learning insights to provide the right products and configurations, at the right price to close the deal, consistently across every sales channel:

• | PROS Smart CPQ automates the quoting process, enabling sales teams, partners and end customers on eCommerce platforms to provide fast, error-free quotes. Infused with AI and machine learning, Smart CPQ provides personalized product and pricing recommendations to deliver targeted offers designed to win competitive business.


• | PROS Opportunity Detection increases sales productivity, accelerating quota attainment by uncovering sales opportunities in existing accounts for sales teams, and delivers data-driven product recommendations designed to increase average cart size for eCommerce sites. By applying AI and machine learning techniques to historical transactional activity, Opportunity Detection surfaces new opportunities to help proactively increase account penetration with existing customers while preventing customer churn.

Solutions for Pricing 
PROS pricing solutions enable enterprises to optimize, personalize, and harmonize pricing across the complexity of their go-to-market channels in the context of dynamic market and competitive conditions. Our pricing solutions include:

• | PROS Control provides a comprehensive pricing platform that offers a single source of accuracy for price measurement, coordination, and strategy. This platform allows businesses to harmonize pricing across go-to-market channels while simultaneously increasing price discipline and protecting price attainment. Pricing users leverage this solution to deploy formulaic price strategies that can incorporate real-time information or conditional data to ensure that every delivered price is up-to-date with the latest market and competitive conditions. With the performance, power, and scalability of PROS Control’s Real-Time Pricing Engine, even B2C organizations can replace price lists across commerce channels with dynamic calculations for price requests, ensuring that every delivered price is cognizant of conditions at the time of request. This engine allows businesses facing volatile price competition to leverage data science to systematically adjust pricing in real time. 


• | PROS Guidance leverages AI to provide market-relevant price guidance across sales channels that is dynamically refined to adapt to changing market conditions and buyer behavior. This prescriptive price guidance provides optimized pricing for each unique buying scenario, which helps businesses recover margin leakage, accelerate quote turnaround times and increase win-rates. PROS Guidance also provides businesses transparency within their pricing model via insight into the market prices behind each price recommendation.

Airline Revenue Optimization
PROS airline revenue optimization solutions enable enterprises in the travel industry, including the airline, hotel and cruise industries, to drive revenue- and profit-maximizing business strategies through the application of advanced forecasting, optimization technologies and decision-support capabilities. These solutions are designed to empower companies to quickly adapt

to changing market conditions, differentiate customers by market and sales channel, monitor pricing and revenue management performance, and increase customer loyalty by providing the right products and services to the right customer at the right time. Our Airline Revenue Optimization suite of products includes:

• | PROS Airline Revenue Management delivers algorithmic forecasting and network optimization for the travel industry. Companies leverage our demand management and forecasting capabilities to determine overbooking levels and manage fare values as pricing updates become available.

Airline eCommerce
Our Airline eCommerce solutions power airlines to become better retailers by increasing their control over how they sell and distribute offers. These solutions provide airlines with shopping and merchandising capabilities to design and distribute offers across individuals and groups. The solutions are powered by proprietary algorithms, compliant with industry pricing and distribution standards and entirely passenger service system-independent. Our Airline eCommerce suite of products includes:

• | PROS Airline Shopping powers airlines' shopping, pricing and repricing by delivering fast, accurate and comprehensive flight offers to travelers across airlines’ sales channels.


• | PROS Airline Merchandising Increases airlines conversion and revenues per passenger by dynamically selling ancillary services, including extra baggage, legroom and other services. Airlines can upsell with personalized offers at any time in the customer journey using rich content across the airlines' sales channels.

Technology
Our high-performance software architecture supports real-time, high-volume transaction processing and enables us to handle the complex and demanding processing requirements of sophisticated global enterprises, including those who require sub-second response times for their customers. We provide the majority of our cloud services via cloud computing platform partners who offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking, located in the U.S., Germany, United Kingdom, Australia and other countries. The use of cloud computing platform partners provides us flexibility to service customers at scale and also offer options to comply with in-country data privacy requirements. We also deliver our solutions from infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within third-party data center facilities. We offer both single-tenant and multi-tenant cloud solutions.
Artificial Intelligence. Our robust machine learning and AI capabilities include forecasting, optimization, neural networks, segmentation and reinforcement learning and allow us to leverage our deep science and research expertise in our solutions. These capabilities are industry-independent and are validated using our proprietary verification and testing processes.
Configuration vs. Custom Coding. Our solutions can be configured to meet each customer's business needs through configuration rather than custom code. The configuration capabilities define both a business layer (including definition of user workflows, executive dashboards, analytics views, calculations, approval processes and alerts), as well as a data layer that permits configuration of data structures, including hierarchical dimensions, pricing levels and measures. We maintain our customers' configurations which allows them to use the latest version of our solutions.
Data Integration. The data needed to execute and power personalized digital buying typically resides in multiple sources, such as a company's enterprise resource planning ("ERP"), supply chain management ("SCM"), customer relationship management ("CRM"), reservations and inventory systems, external market data sources, spreadsheets and/or industry-specific transaction systems. Our data integration capabilities bring data from disparate sources together into a single cohesive database, both in real time and through scheduled batch tasks. We also provide certified content for integration with SAP as well as integration development services using industry standard tools.
Micro-services Architecture. A comprehensive web services interface is at the heart of our architecture. This interface enables extension onto other platforms and the creation of rich integrated solutions.

User Interface. Our technology provides a rich and modern, browser-based interface that supports both local and remote users. This interface supports a wide variety of interactive charts and other data views, and provides a comprehensive security model based on user role and scope of responsibility. We also offer capabilities for multiple mobile devices, tablets, CRM systems and client applications.
Subscription Services
Our subscription services provide customers access to our software via the Internet which, as compared to an on-premise software model, helps reduce their infrastructure, installation and ongoing administration requirements. We also reduce the total cost of ownership of our cloud services over the subscription term by delivering multiple feature releases per year that automatically introduce new features, while preserving previous customizations and integrations that minimize additional customer investment for compatibility. We also offer cloud-based services to allow existing customers who previously purchased licenses to our software to have access to that software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage. 
Sales and Marketing
We sell and market our software solutions primarily through our direct global sales force and indirectly through go-to-market partners, resellers and systems integrators. Our sales force is organized by our target markets, including automotive and industrial, B2B services, cargo, chemicals and energy, consumer goods, insurance, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech and travel. Our marketing activities consist of a variety of programs designed to generate sales leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build awareness of our solutions. We also use digital channels including search and content syndication to reach our target market. We host an annual customer conference, Outperform, where our customers and prospects are invited to learn about best practices from thought leaders, executives and other practitioners in using sales, pricing and revenue management to compete in the digital economy, hear about our latest innovations, and network with peers across industries. We also host other smaller conferences throughout the year, host informational web seminars and participate in and sponsor other industry and trade conferences and organizations. 
Professional Services
We provide software-related professional services, including implementation and configuration services, consulting and training services. Our software solution implementations have a standardized and tested implementation process developed through years of experience implementing our software solutions in global enterprises across multiple industries. We also offer change management, process redesign, organizational design, opportunity assessment, performance management consulting, as well as an array of training on all aspects of our software solutions, from introductory on-demand mini-courses to multi-day hands-on deep technical classroom sessions. In addition to our own internal professional services team, we also work with many globally diverse partners who have been certified to implement our software.
Maintenance and Support
Customers maintaining implementations under on-premise licenses may purchase, at their discretion, maintenance and support services. Maintenance enrollment entitles a customer to solicit support through a web-based interface to submit and track issues, access our online knowledge base, and receive unspecified upgrades, maintenance releases and bug fixes during the term of the support period on a when-and-if-available basis. We invest significant resources in providing these services. 
Revenue from maintenance and support services has declined as a percentage of our total revenue since we announced our cloud strategy as customers have purchased fewer on-premise licenses to our software. We expect our maintenance revenue to continue to decrease further as more existing customers migrate to our cloud solutions. Revenue from maintenance and support services comprised 33%, 41%, and 45% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Customers
We sell our software solutions to customers across many industries, including automotive and industrial, B2B services, cargo, chemicals and energy, consumer goods, insurance, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech and travel. Our customers are generally large global enterprises and medium-sized businesses, although we also have customers that are smaller in scope of operations. In each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had no single customer that accounted for 10% or more of our revenue. Our customers are also geographically diverse, as approximately 65%, 63%, and 63% of our total revenue came from customers outside the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

We provide our customers with several service options including a customer success management team to help our customers accelerate the value of their investments in our solutions; a professional services ecosystem of both our professional service teams and certified third party system integrators; 24x7 support; and an online community to facilitate collaboration among our customers and our product development teams.
Competition
The markets for our products and services are competitive, fragmented and rapidly evolving. For example, we have seen consolidation in the quoting software market with large vendors acquiring smaller quoting companies as they attempt to provide end-to-end solutions to drive sales and profit. Today, we are increasingly competing in a sales ecosystem with competitors that all aim to drive effectiveness and efficiency in selling, although we believe we are unmatched in our ability to deliver sales and pricing AI with speed and precision. We face collective competition from a number of larger and smaller companies, including vendors that provide software for specific industries, vendors that compete against a portion of our pricing solutions, vendors that compete against our selling improvement solutions, and vendors that compete against a portion of our revenue management and shopping and merchandising solutions in the airline industry. To a lesser extent, we compete against large enterprise application providers that have developed offerings that include competing functionality and custom solutions developed internally by businesses, which generally include some combination of spreadsheets, manual processes, external consultants, and internally-developed software tools.
The number of companies that we compete with has increased in recent years as we expanded into adjacent technologies. We believe our customers consider the following factors when evaluating our solutions versus competitive solutions: 

• | product architecture, functionality, performance, reliability and scalability;


• | strength of AI embedded in offerings;


• | real-time capabilities;


• | customer base and references;


• | return on investment, total cost of ownership, and time-to-value;


• | breadth and depth of product and service offerings;


• | depth of expertise in data and pricing science;


• | industry domain expertise;


• | services and customer support quality;


• | size and quality of partner ecosystem;


• | existing customer relationships; and


• | vendor viability.

We believe that none of our competitors can provide all of the functionality needed to support an organization interested in optimizing sales growth through AI-based omnichannel pricing, selling improvement and revenue management. Our competitors generally compete on price or by bundling their applications with other enterprise applications, and we expect that this will continue in the future. We distinguish ourselves from these vendors through our long history of providing software solutions incorporating AI, data science, and/or machine learning, the breadth and depth of the functionality we offer, the robust integration and configuration capabilities of our solutions, our ability to handle large data volumes at scale, and our proven ability to provide high-value dynamic science-based optimization software to our global customer base across industries. In the future, we believe our competition will continue to increase as more companies move into our market segment and as we expand into adjacent market segments.
Intellectual Property 
Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We protect our intellectual property with a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, patents, trademarks, copyrights and other similar measures. We believe that reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how are generally the most advantageous methods for us to protect our proprietary information.

Research and Development
We believe our software innovation is the foundation of our business and accordingly have made, and continue to make, significant investments in research and development for the enhancement of existing products and services and the development of new products and services. We also believe that our long-term investments in AI and machine learning of pricing and revenue management differentiate us from our competitors. We are committed to continuing the further development of these high-value solutions as evidenced by our continued investment in research and development. In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred expenses of $55.7 million, $56.0 million and $52.8 million, respectively, in research and development, net of capitalized internal-use software cost, to enhance our existing portfolio of solutions and to develop new solutions. Our research and development expenses include costs associated with our product management, product development and science and research groups. We conduct research and development activities predominantly in Bulgaria, France and the U.S., and also utilize third-party contractors in Bolivia, Colombia and India. 
We employ data scientists, most of whom are Ph.D.'s, to advance sales, pricing, and revenue management technology and its implementation in our software solutions. These scientists have specialties including, but not limited to, AI, machine learning, operations research, management science, statistics, econometrics and computational methods. Our data scientists regularly interact with our customers, product development, sales, marketing and professional services staff to help keep our science efforts relevant to real-world demands.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,145 full-time personnel, which included 1,011 employees and 134 outsourced personnel. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
