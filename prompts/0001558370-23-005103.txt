Item 1. Business.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
General Development of Business
Retractable Technologies, Inc. was incorporated in Texas in 1994. Our business is the manufacturing and marketing of safety medical products (predominately syringes) for the healthcare industry. We have manufacturing facilities in Little Elm, Texas and use manufacturers in China as well. Our syringes are well-suited for administering vaccinations and our revenues materially increased in 2020-2021 due to COVID-19 vaccination demand. Our revenues decreased as sales to the U.S. government for vaccinations wound down in the first quarter of 2022, although international vaccination demand positively impacted sales throughout 2022. 
We increased our manufacturing capacity in Little Elm, Texas, funded in part by the Technology Investment Agreement ("TIA") with the United States Government Department of Defense, U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division & Edgewood Contracting Division (ACC-APG, NCD & ECD) on behalf of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), as amended (“TIA”). The TIA funded the $81.0 million facilities expansion and purchase of new manufacturing equipment and related ancillary equipment. At our own expense, we constructed a new warehouse onsite for housing finished goods and raw materials to be used in the manufacturing process as well as an expansion to our administrative offices. 
Description of Business
Our goal is to become a leading provider of safety medical products. Our principal products were designed to protect healthcare workers, patients, and others from needlestick injuries, cross-contamination through reuse, and reduce disposal costs.
Our dominant revenue-generating products are our injection devices (syringes and needles). Such products are marketed under the VanishPoint®, Patient Safe®, and EasyPoint® brands. We have only one reporting segment. Most of our products incorporate a feature whereby our needles retract which is a safety feature designed to protect healthcare workers from needlestick injuries. Our VanishPoint® 1mL syringes meet the criteria set by pharmaceutical manufacturers for low dead space, which results in a reduction of wasted medication caused by residual medication remaining in the syringe after a dose has been administered. In some instances, the low dead space allows for additional doses to be obtained from a medication vial.
VanishPoint® syringe sales have historically comprised most of our sales. VanishPoint® syringe sales were 91.5%; 93.6%; and 84.0% of our revenues in 2022, 2021, and 2020. EasyPoint® products accounted for 4.9% of sales in 2022.

From 2020 through the first quarter of 2022, the U.S. government was a significant customer due to efforts to vaccinate the U.S. population against COVID-19. Sales to the Department of Health and Human Services for safety syringes totaled $15.7 million in 2022 (concentrated in the first quarter), $113.7 million in 2021, and $31.6 million in 2020. The orders from the Department of Health and Human Services included reimbursement of freight costs. As such, comparability of 2022 revenue and expenses to revenues and expenses in recent years may be challenging. Moreover, we believe domestic customers may have retained product provided for vaccination purposes in inventory through 2022, leading to a decrease in overall demand. 
We currently have under development additional safety products that add to or build upon our current product line offering. 
Our products are sold to and used by healthcare providers. Historically, an overwhelming majority of our products have been sold domestically. However, in 2022, 44.9% of our sales were international sales. The increase is attributable to higher international revenues from vaccination efforts which lagged domestic vaccination sales by a year or more.
In years not dominated by direct sales to the U.S. government, representatives of group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) and purchasing representatives (rather than the end-users of the product) make the vast majority of decisions relating to the purchase of medical supplies. The GPOs and larger manufacturers often enter into contracts which can prohibit or limit entry in the marketplace by competitors.
We distribute our products throughout the U.S. through general line and specialty distributors. We also use international distributors. We have developed a national direct marketing network in order to market our products to health care customers and their purchaser representatives.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Our product components, including needle adhesives and packaging materials, are purchased from various suppliers. There is no current scarcity of such materials or such suppliers.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property rights, particularly patent rights, are material to our business. The patent rights are jointly owned by the Company and Thomas J. Shaw, our founder and CEO, and have varying expiration dates. Under the terms of an exclusive license agreement that has been in effect since 1995, the Company is exclusively licensed to use the patent rights held by Mr. Shaw, and Mr. Shaw generally receives a 5% royalty on gross sales of products subject to the license and he receives 50% of the royalties paid to the Company by certain sublicensees of the technology subject to the license.
Recent and expected modifications to our VanishPoint® syringes will effectively cause the modified VanishPoint® syringes products to have extended patent expiration dates. Following the expiration of patents related to the old design, competitors may attempt to copy aspects of such prior design, but not the current design. Patents related to recent modifications to the VanishPoint® syringes and core technology of the VanishPoint® syringes will expire during the years 2028 through 2032. Other patent applications covering inventions applicable to the VanishPoint® syringes are pending.
The Company has unexpired patents which relate to the EasyPoint® technology and other products as well.
The Company has registered the following trade names and trademarks for our products: VanishPoint®, EasyPoint®, Patient Safe®, VanishPoint® logos, RT and design, the VanishPoint® and design, the spot design and the Company slogans “The New Standard for Safety” ® and “We Make Safety Safe” ®. 
Seasonality
Historically, unit sales have increased during the flu season. Seasonal trends were less pronounced in 2020 and 2021 due to demand related to the COVID-19 vaccine. Trends in 2022 were difficult to categorize by revenue figures, as

2022 demand was affected by a surplus of products remaining in our customers’ inventories following vaccination-related purchases and grants in 2020-2021.
Government Approval and Government Regulations
Compliance with government regulations represents an important part of our business. As a manufacturer of medical devices and operating under the TIA, we are subject to stringent regulatory requirements. In addition, we are also subject to maintain systems to monitor and report our findings to various regulatory bodies. We are also subject to audit by those bodies and/or third parties acting as proxies to verify our compliance with such regulations. The cost of compliance can be significant in terms of financial and human resource commitments. These costs are ongoing and may become more significant if the regulatory landscape changes.
​
The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of our products are subject to government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar international regulatory agencies. Regulation by various international, federal and state agencies address the development and approval to market medical products, as well as approval and supervision of manufacturing, labeling, packaging, supply chains, distribution and record-keeping.
For all products manufactured for sale in the domestic market, we have given notice of intent to market to the FDA, and the devices were shown to be substantially equivalent to the predicate devices for the stated intended use. For all products manufactured for sale in the domestic market and foreign market, we hold a Quality Management System certification to ISO 13485:2016. Additionally, for all products manufactured for sale into the applicable countries, we hold a Quality Management System certification in compliance with the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP). We do not currently hold a CE mark but are pursuing certification to sell into the European Union. 
Compliance with domestic and international laws and regulations may affect our business. Among other effects, health care regulations and significant changes thereto may substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining, and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. We expect this regulatory environment will continue to require effort and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply could delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties.
The regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information (including patient health information, financial information, and other sensitive personal information), is increasing. For example, the European Union, various other countries, and various U.S. states (e.g., California) have enacted stricter data protection laws that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information, and the FDA has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices. In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering “data localization” laws, which limit companies’ ability to transfer protected data across country borders. Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties.
The sale of medical products is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States.
We will continue to comply with applicable regulations of all countries in which our products are registered for sale.
We believe that we do not incur material costs in connection with compliance with environmental laws.

Competitive Conditions
Our competitive position remains much the same as before the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to face fierce competition from much larger and more established companies across the U.S. healthcare market. While our products were widely used in the mass vaccination efforts during the CODID-19 pandemic, there is no assurance that we will be able to gain market share due to our relative size and presence in the overall U.S. healthcare market. 
Becton. Dickinson and Company (“BD”), a global company which we had previously considered our primary competitor, spun off a portion of its syringe, needle, and injection product division as Embecta Corp. (“Embecta”) in April 2022. Though newly formed, Embecta licenses existing BD intellectual property and has continued to use the BD branding on its products and is provided with certain other services by BD. Embecta, which specializes in diabetes management, along with BD itself, are formidable competitors with greater market share and greater resources than us.
We compete primarily on the basis of healthcare worker and patient safety, product performance, and quality. We believe our competitive advantages include, but are not limited to, our leadership in quality and innovation. We believe our products continue to be the most effective safety devices in today’s market. Our VanishPoint® 1mL syringes meet the criteria set by pharmaceutical manufacturers for low dead space, which results in a reduction of wasted medication caused by residual medication remaining in the syringe after a dose has been administered. In some instances, the low dead space allows for additional doses to be obtained from a medication vial. Our syringe products include passive safety activation, require less disposal space, and are activated while in the patient, reducing exposure to the contaminated needle. Our price per unit is competitive or even lower than the competition once all the costs incurred during the life cycle of a syringe are considered. Such life cycle costs include disposal costs, testing and treatment costs for needlestick injuries, and treatment for contracted illnesses resulting from needlestick injuries.
EasyPoint® retractable needles offer unique safety benefits not found in other commercially available safety needles.  Manually activated safety needles that compete with EasyPoint® must be removed from the patient, exposing the contaminated needle prior to activation of the manual safety mechanism.  EasyPoint® needles allow for activation of the automated retraction mechanism while the needle is still in the patient, reducing exposure to the contaminated needle and effectively reducing the risk of needlestick injuries.  EasyPoint® retractable needles are compatible with Luer-fitting syringes, including pre-filled syringes.  In addition, EasyPoint® retractable needles may be activated with fluid in the syringe, making it applicable for aspiration procedures such as blood collection.
Employees
As of March 10, 2023, we had 198 employees. 190 of such employees were full time employees. We provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital status, ancestry, veteran status, workers’ compensation status or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. We have adopted a policy of zero tolerance for any form of unlawful discrimination or retaliation. In 2021, we increased wages considerably, particularly for our entry-level employees, in order to compete for labor. 
​
On March 22, 2023, we reduced our workforce by approximately 22% as a result of decreased need for domestic production. The decrease in headcount will result in expected annualized savings in salaries and wage expense of approximately $1.7 million, or 13%. We expect to incur approximately $154 thousand in separation costs as a result.
