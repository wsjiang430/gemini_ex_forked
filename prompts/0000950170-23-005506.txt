Overview and Industry Outlook
 We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, government actions and measures taken to prevent its spread, and the potential to affect our operations, particularly in China. We are also monitoring the current global economic environment, specifically including inflationary pressures and the macroeconomic impact of the conflict in Ukraine, and any resulting impacts on our financial position and results of operations. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional information.
 Both the market for drilling and production equipment and services and the Company’s business are substantially dependent on the condition of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on exploration, drilling and production operations. The level of capital expenditures has generally been dependent upon the prevailing view of future oil and gas prices, which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas, including worldwide economic activity, interest rates and the cost of capital, environmental regulation, tax policies and the ability and/or desire of OPEC+ and other producing nations to set and maintain production levels and prices.
Crude oil price recovery, which began in the latter half of 2020, continued in 2022 as the oil markets remained encouraging throughout the year. During 2022, crude oil prices fluctuated significantly, with a high of $133.18 per barrel and a low of $76.02 per barrel. According to the January 2023 release of the Short-Term Energy Outlook published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U.S. Department of Energy, Brent crude oil prices averaged approximately $100.94 per barrel in 2022, and the price is forecasted to average $83.10 per barrel in 2023 and $77.57 per barrel in 2024. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and gas may cancel or curtail programs, seek to renegotiate contract terms, including the price of products and services, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons.
 The volatility in Brent crude oil prices over the past three years continues to have an effect on major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies’ capital expenditure budgets. Capital expenditures are also dependent on the cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas, the availability, expiration date and price of leases, the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves, technological advances and alternative opportunities to invest in onshore exploration and production operations. Oil and gas prices and the level of drilling and production activity have historically been characterized by significant volatility. Future declines in oil and gas prices may further adversely affect the willingness of some oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on exploration, drilling and production operations, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—A material or extended decline in expenditures by the oil and gas industry could significantly reduce our revenue and income.”
 As the energy industry embraces a transition, Dril-Quip is actively pursuing opportunities to engage with customers that are working in the areas of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). This nascent industry aligns well with the Company's core capabilities and expertise and also provides us with an avenue to expand our offerings. We see a healthy project pipeline developing and are actively engaging with customers to explore how we leverage our products and position to help them navigate through the energy transition.
 Brent crude oil prices per barrel for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 are summarized below:


 | Brent Crude Oil Prices | 
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | | 2020
High | $ | 133.18 | | $ | 85.76 | | $ | 70.25
Low | | 76.02 | | | 50.37 | | | 9.12 
Average | | 100.94 | | | 70.86 | | | 41.96
Closing, December 31, | | 82.82 | | | 77.24 | | | 51.22

 
In its January 2023 Short-Term Energy Outlook, the EIA reported United States crude oil production averaged an estimated 11.9 million barrels per day in 2022 and is forecasted to average 12.4 million barrels per day in 2023.
Products and Services
 Dril-Quip’s revenues are generated from three sources: products, services and leasing. Product revenues are derived from the sale of drilling and production equipment. Service revenues are earned when the Company provides technical advisory assistance and rework and reconditioning services. Leasing revenues are derived from rental tools used during installation and retrieval of the Company’s products. In 2022, the Company derived 66.5% of its revenues from the sale of its products, 21.9% of its revenues from services and 11.6% from leasing revenues, compared to 66.1%, 23.0% and 10.9% for products, services and leasing in 2021, respectively, and 70.9%, 20.7% and 8.4% for products, services and leasing in 2020, respectively. Service and leasing revenues generally correlate to revenues from product sales because increased product sales typically generate increased demand for technical advisory assistance services during installation and rental of running tools. However, existing customer equipment can be used in certain circumstances, which creates demand for services with no correlating product sales. The Company has substantial international operations, with approximately 66.2% of its revenues derived from foreign sales in 2022, 63.8% in 2021 and 66.7% in 2020.

Substantially all of the Company’s domestic revenue relates to operations in the U. S. Gulf of Mexico. Domestic revenue approximated 33.8% of the Company’s total revenues in 2022, 36.2% in 2021 and 33.3% in 2020.
 Product contracts are typically negotiated and sold separately from service contracts. In addition, service contracts are not typically included in the product contracts or related sales orders and are not offered to the customer as a condition of the sale of the Company’s products. The demand for products and services is generally based on worldwide economic conditions in the oil and gas industry and is not based on a specific relationship between the two types of contracts. Substantially all of the Company’s sales are made on a purchase order basis. Purchase orders are subject to change or termination at the option of the customer. In case of a change or termination, the customer is required to pay the Company for work performed and other costs necessarily incurred as a result of the change or termination.
 Generally, the Company attempts to raise its prices as its costs increase. However, the actual pricing of the Company’s products and services is impacted by a number of factors, including global oil prices, competitive pricing pressure, the level of utilized capacity in the oil service sector, maintenance of market share, the introduction of new products and general market conditions.
 Products
 Dril-Quip designs, manufactures, fabricates, inspects, assembles, tests and markets subsea equipment, downhole tools, surface equipment and offshore rig equipment. The Company’s products are used primarily for exploration and production of oil and gas from offshore drilling rigs, such as floating rigs and jack-up rigs, and for drilling and production of oil and gas wells on offshore platforms, tension leg platforms (TLPs), Spars and moored vessels such as floating production, storage and offloading monohull moored vessels (FPSOs). TLPs are floating production platforms that are connected to the ocean floor via vertical mooring tethers. A Spar is a floating cylindrical structure approximately six or seven times longer than its diameter and is anchored in place. The Downhole Tool products are used in the drilling and production for oil and gas both onshore and offshore.
 Subsea Equipment - Subsea equipment is used in the drilling and production of offshore oil and gas wells as well as injecting CO2 into offshore reservoirs around the world. Included in the subsea equipment product line are subsea wellheads systems, mudline hanger systems, specialty connectors and associated pipe, production riser systems, subsea production trees, subsea manifolds and liner hangers.
 Subsea wellheads are pressure-containing vessels that are sometimes referred to as a “wellhead housing” and are made from forged and machined steel. A casing hanger, also made of steel, lands inside the wellhead housing and suspends casing (pipe) downhole. As drilling depth increases, successively smaller diameter casing strings are installed, each suspended by an independent casing hanger. Subsea wellheads systems are utilized when drilling from floating drilling rigs, either semi-submersible or drillship types, or TLPs and Spars. The Company’s flagship subsea wellhead, called the SS-15® Subsea Wellhead System, is rated for 15,000 pounds per square inch (psi) internal pressure and is offered to the industry in a variety of configurations. The Company’s newest wellhead product, the e-Series Subsea Wellhead Systems (SS-15/20 BigBore II-e and SS-15 RLDe), are designed to contain higher pressures (up to 20,000 psi) and provides the ability to reduce the number of casing strings in the well design by increasing load carrying and pressure capacities of casing hangers and associated installation tools.
 Mudline hanger systems are used in jack-up drilling operations to support the weight of the various casing strings at the ocean floor while drilling a well. They also provide a method to disconnect the casing strings in an orderly manner at the ocean floor after the well has been drilled, and subsequently reconnect utilizing metal-to-metal sealing technology to enable production of the well by either tying it back vertically to a subsequently installed platform or by installing a shallow water subsea tree.
 Large diameter weld-on specialty connectors (threaded or stab type) are used primarily in offshore wells drilled from floating drilling rigs, jack-up rigs, fixed platforms, TLPs and Spars. Specialty connectors join lengths of conductor or large diameter (16-inch or greater) casing. Specialty connectors provide a more rapid connection than other methods of connecting lengths of pipe. Connectors may be sold individually or as an assembly after being welded to sections of Company or customer supplied pipe. Dril-Quip’s weld-on specialty connectors are designed to prevent cross threading and provide a quick, convenient method of joining casing joints with structural integrity compatible with casing strength.
 Production riser systems are generally designed and manufactured to customer specifications. Production risers provide a vertical conduit from the subsea wellhead up to a TLP, Spar or FPSO floating at the surface.


A subsea production tree is an assembly composed of flow and pressure control valves, a wellhead connector, control equipment and various other components such as pressure/temperature sensors, chemical injection valves and flowline connection systems. Subsea trees are installed on a subsea wellhead or a mudline hanger system and used to control the flow of oil and gas from a producing well or control flow of CO2 injection into an offshore reservoir. Subsea trees may be used as stand-alone satellite wells or multiple well template mounted and cluster arrangements. These types typically produce via a subsea gathering system of manifolds and flowlines to a central control point located on a platform, TLP, Spar or FPSO. The use of subsea production trees has become an increasingly important method for producing wells located in hard-to-reach deepwater (and ultra-deepwater) areas or economically marginal fields located in shallower waters. The Company is an established manufacturer of single, dual and concentric bore as well as horizontal bore production trees. Single bore subsea completion systems eliminate the need for an expensive multibore installation and workover riser, thereby saving both cost and installation time. The horizontal bore subsea production completion system accommodates numerous completion configuration possibilities and features large vertical access drill-through for passage of drill-bits, submersible pumps, coil tubing strings and Dril-Quip’s slimline casing hanger system. The concentric monobore vertical bore subsea production system accommodates numerous completion configuration possibilities including in tubing head and in the subsea wellhead. Dril-Quip’s newly patented VXTe design and technology allows for simpler installations within the wellhead completions by eliminating the requirements of special orientation devices like tubing heads. These trees feature remote flowline and control connections, utilizing remotely operated intervention tools. The Company’s subsea production trees are generally custom designed and manufactured to customer specifications.
 Downhole Tools - Downhole tools are primarily comprised of liner hangers, production packers, safety valves and specialty downhole tools. A liner hanger is used to hang-off and seal casing into a previously installed casing string in the well bore and can provide a means of tying back the liner for production to surface. Dril-Quip offers conventional and expandable state-of-the-art liner hanger system and has installed its liner hangers in a number of difficult well applications such as High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) and geothermal applications, resulting in improved industry recognition and market opportunities.
Surface Equipment - Surface equipment is principally used for flow control on offshore production platforms, offshore CO2 injection installations, TLPs and Spars. Included in the Company’s surface equipment product line are platform wellheads, platform production trees and riser tensioners. Dril-Quip’s development of platform wellheads and platform production trees was facilitated by adaptation of its existing subsea wellhead and tree technology to surface wellheads and trees.
 Platform wellheads are pressure-containing forged and machined metal housings in which casing hangers are landed and sealed at the platform deck to suspend casings. The Company emphasizes the use of metal-to-metal sealing wellhead systems with operational time-saving features which can be used in high pressure, high temperature and corrosive drilling and production applications.
 After installation of a wellhead, a platform production tree, consisting of gate valves, a surface wellhead connector, controls, tree cap and associated equipment, is installed on the wellhead to control and regulate oil and gas production or CO2 injection. Platform production trees are similar to subsea production trees but utilize less complex equipment and more manual, rather than hydraulically actuated, valves and connectors. Platform wellheads and platform production trees and associated equipment are designed and manufactured in accordance with customer specifications.
 Riser tensioners are used on a floating drilling/production vessel to provide a continuous and reliable upward force on a riser string that is independent of the movement of the floating vessel.
 Rig Equipment - Rig equipment includes drilling riser systems, wellhead connectors, diverters, safety valves and cement manifolds. The drilling riser system consists of (i) lengths of riser pipe and associated riser connectors that secure one to another; (ii) the telescopic joint, which connects the entire drilling riser system to the diverter at top of the riser at the rig and provides a means to compensate for vertical motion of the rig relative to the ocean floor; and (iii) the wellhead connector , which provides a means for remote connection and disconnection of the blowout preventer stack to or from the wellhead. Diverters are used to provide protection from shallow gas blowouts and to divert gases off of the rig during the drilling operation. A safety valve is used to provide a quick, sure shutoff in the drill string at the drill floor and prevent flow up the drill pipe. The TIW Kelly Valve is located in the drill string below the kelly, the uppermost component of the drill string, and is designed to be closed under pressure to remove the kelly. Cement manifolds are used to control the flow of cement and other fluids during the cementing operations of the well installation.
 Wellhead connectors are used on production riser systems and drilling riser systems. They are also used on both TLPs and Spars, which are installed in deepwater applications. The principal markets for offshore rig equipment are new rigs, rig upgrades, TLPs and Spars. Drilling risers, wellhead connectors and diverters are generally designed and manufactured to customer specifications.


Certain of the Company’s products are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion and production applications that can cause personal injury, product liability and environmental claims. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business involves numerous operating hazards that may not be covered by insurance. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.”
 Services
 The Company provides services to customers, including technical advisory assistance as well as rework, reconditioning, storage, and maintenance services on its customer-owned products. These services are provided from the Company’s worldwide locations and represented approximately 21.9% of revenues in 2022 compared to 23.0% in 2021 and 20.7% in 2020.
 Technical Advisory Assistance. Dril-Quip generally does not install products for its customers, but it does provide technical advisory assistance to the customer, if requested, in the installation and/or commissioning of its products. The customer is not obligated to utilize these services and may use its own personnel or a third party to perform these services. Technical advisory assistance services performed by the Company are negotiated and sold separately from the Company’s products. These services are not a prerequisite to the sale of the Company’s products as its products are fully functional on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s technicians provide assistance in the onsite installation of the Company’s products and are available on a 24-hour call out from the Company’s facilities located in Houston, Texas; Villahermosa, Mexico; Shushufindi, Ecuador; Macae, Brazil; Aberdeen, Scotland; Stavanger, Norway; Esbjerg, Denmark; Alexandria, Egypt; Takoradi, Ghana; Shenzhen, China; Doha, Qatar; Singapore; and Perth, Australia.
 Reconditioning. The Company provides reconditioning of its customer-owned products at its facilities in Houston, Texas; Macae, Brazil; Aberdeen, Scotland; Stavanger, Norway; Esbjerg, Denmark; Alexandria, Egypt; Takoradi, Ghana; Tianjin, China; Doha, Qatar; Singapore; and Perth, Australia. The Company does not typically service, repair or recondition its competitors’ products.
Leasing
 The Company leases running and installation tools for use in installation or workover of its products. These tools are required to install, test and retrieve the Company’s products that are purchased by customers. Rental or purchase of running tools is not a condition of the sale of the Company’s products and is contracted for separately from product sales and other services offered by the Company. Running tools are available from Dril-Quip’s locations in Houston, Texas; Villahermosa, Mexico; Shushufindi, Ecuador; Macae, Brazil; Aberdeen, Scotland; Stavanger, Norway; Esbjerg, Denmark; Shenzhen, China; Singapore; and Perth, Australia. These rentals are provided from the Company’s worldwide locations and represented approximately 11.6% of revenues in 2022 compared to 10.9% in 2021 and 8.4% in 2020.
Manufacturing
 Dril-Quip has manufacturing facilities in Houston, Texas; Aberdeen, Scotland; Singapore; and Macae, Brazil. See “Item 2. Properties—Manufacturing Facilities.” Dril-Quip maintains its high standards of product quality through the use of quality control specialists and implementation of continuous improvement methodologies. These continuous improvement methodologies leverage Lean practices and focus on improving processes with the goal of providing world-class quality, delivery and service to our customers at the highest possible value.
 The Company’s Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore and Macae manufacturing plants are ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ISO 9001 certified. The Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore and Macae plants are also licensed to applicable American Petroleum Institute (API) product specifications and are API Q1, 9th edition and API Q2 compliant. Dril-Quip works to maintain its high standards of product quality through the use of precision measuring equipment such as MRP gages, Faro Arms, Coordinate Measuring Machine and the application of Lean practices. The Company has the capability to manufacture its products globally and continues to have local capability in key critical markets. The Company’s primary raw material is forged steel products which it procures from qualified forging suppliers located globally as well as domestically.
Dril-Quip’s manufacturing facilities utilize state-of-the-art computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools and equipment, which contribute to the Company’s product quality and timely delivery. The Company has made significant investments for a complete upgrade of it's manufacturing of subsea wellhead product line with the latest equipment and technology.
Customers
 The Company’s principal customers are major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies. Drilling contractors and engineering and construction companies also represent a portion of the Company’s customer base. The Company’s customers are generally oil and gas companies that are well-known participants in exploration and production.


The Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers. In 2022, the Company’s top 15 customers represented approximately 60% of total revenues, and Chevron Corporation and its affiliated companies (“Chevron”) accounted for approximately 10% of total revenues. In 2021, the Company’s top 15 customers represented approximately 59% of total revenues, and Chevron accounted for approximately 12% of total revenues. In 2020, the Company’s top 15 customers represented approximately 60% of total revenue, and Chevron accounted for approximately 11% of total revenues. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020. The number and variety of the Company’s products required in a given year by any one customer depends upon the amount of that customer’s capital expenditure budget devoted to exploration and production and on the results of competitive bids for major projects. Consequently, a customer that accounts for a significant portion of revenues in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in subsequent years. While the Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, the loss of one or more of its significant customers could, at least on a short-term basis, have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.
 Backlog
 Backlog consists of firm customer orders of Dril-Quip products for which a purchase order, signed contract or letter of award has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled. The Company's backlog primarily consists of our Subsea products. Historically, the Company’s revenues for a specific period have not been directly related to its backlog as stated at a particular point in time. The Company’s product backlog was approximately $240.9 million and $210.1 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The backlog at the end of 2022 represents an increase of approximately $30.8 million, or 14.6%, from the end of 2021. The Company’s backlog balance was positively impacted during 2022 as our product bookings increased due to improved market conditions.
The Company expects to fill approximately 70% to 80% of the December 31, 2022 product backlog by December 31, 2023. The remaining backlog at December 31, 2022 consists of longer-term projects which are being designed and manufactured to customer specifications requiring longer lead times.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future revenues and earnings.”
 Marketing and Sales
 Dril-Quip markets its products and services throughout the world directly through its sales personnel in multiple domestic and international locations. In addition, in certain foreign markets the Company utilizes independent sales agents or representatives to enhance its marketing and sales efforts.
 Some of the locations in which Dril-Quip has sales agents or representatives are Trinidad, Indonesia, Malaysia, Kuwait, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Although they do not have authority to contractually bind the Company, these representatives market the Company’s products in their respective territories in return for sales commissions. The Company advertises its products and services in trade and technical publications targeted to its customer base. The Company also participates in industry conferences and trade shows to enhance industry awareness of its products.
 The Company’s customers generally order products on a purchase order basis. Orders, other than those considered to be long-term projects, are typically filled within twelve months after receipt, depending on the type of product and whether it is sold out of inventory or requires some customization. Contracts for certain of the Company’s larger, more complex products, such as subsea production trees, drilling risers and equipment for TLPs and Spars, can take a year or more to complete.
 Increasingly, customers enter into long-term contracts (generally three years or more) with the Company covering the purchase of goods and services. These long-term contracts generally specify the products and services, the standard terms of the agreement and often times the price of the goods and services to be purchased. Purchase orders that reference this long-term agreement are then issued by the customer to the Company for specific quantities of the goods and services.
The primary factors influencing a customer’s decision to purchase the Company’s products are the quality, reliability and reputation of the product, price, technology, service and timely delivery. For large drilling and production system orders, project management teams coordinate customer needs with the Company’s engineering, manufacturing and service organizations, as well as with subcontractors and vendors.


A portion of the Company’s business consists of designing, manufacturing and selling equipment, as well as offering technical advisory assistance during installation of the equipment, for major projects pursuant to competitive bids. The number of such projects in any year may fluctuate. The Company’s profitability on such projects is critically dependent on making accurate and cost-effective bids and performing efficiently in accordance with bid specifications. Various factors, including availability of raw materials, changes in customer requirements and governmental regulations, can adversely affect the Company’s performance on individual projects, with potential material adverse effects on project profitability.
 Product Development and Engineering
 The technological demands of the oil and gas industry continue to increase as exploration and drilling expand into more hostile environments. Conditions encountered in these environments include water depths in excess of 10,000 feet, well pressures up to 20,000 psi, well flowing temperatures beyond 350 degrees Fahrenheit and mixed flows of oil, gas and water that may also be highly corrosive and impact material properties.
 Since its founding in 1981, Dril-Quip has actively engaged in continuing research and development efforts to generate new products and improve existing products. When developing new products, the Company typically seeks to design the most technologically advanced version for a particular application to establish its reputation and qualification in that product. Thereafter, the Company leverages its expertise in the more technologically advanced product to produce less costly and complex versions of the product for less demanding applications. The Company also focuses its activities on reducing the overall cost to the customer, which includes not only the initial capital cost but also operating, installation and maintenance costs associated with its products in an effort to help reduce customers’ carbon footprint.
 In the 1980s, the Company introduced its first product, specialty connectors, as well as mudline suspension systems, template systems and subsea wellheads. In the 1990s, the Company introduced a series of new products, including diverters, wellhead connectors, SingleBore subsea trees, improved severe service dual bore subsea trees, subsea and platform valves, platform wellheads, platform trees, subsea tree workover riser systems, drilling riser systems and TLP and Spar production riser systems. Since 2000, Dril-Quip has introduced multiple new products, including liner hangers, subsea manifolds, riser tensioners, and enhanced versions of subsea wellhead connectors and Dril-Quip’s industry leading subsea wellhead systems. Recent product development efforts focus on the evolution and enhancement of Dril-Quip’s subsea tree portfolio to align with projected market needs, ability to meet a wider array of customer applications, and offer customers overall project cost savings through technological advantages.
 Dril-Quip’s product development work is primarily conducted at its facilities in Houston, Texas. In addition to the work of its product development staff, the Company’s application engineering staff provides technical services to customers in connection with the design and sales of its products. The Company’s ability to develop new products and maintain technological advantages is important to its future success. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business could be adversely affected if we do not develop new products and secure and retain patents related to our products.”
 The Company believes that the success of its business depends more on the technical competence, creativity and marketing abilities of its employees than on any individual patent, trademark or copyright. Nevertheless, as part of its ongoing product development and manufacturing activities, Dril-Quip’s policy has been to seek patents when appropriate on inventions concerning new products and product improvements. All patent rights for products developed by employees are assigned to the Company and almost all of the Company’s products have components that are covered by patents.
  Following successful field trials in 2021, Dril-Quip achieved first commercial sales and installations of XPak De liner hanger. This technology is a replacement and improvement to industry standard sub-mudline supplemental hanger systems. The XPak De adds value to operators by completing upper wellbore sections with reduced non-productive time, lower risk, and improved well integrity while reducing contingency costs, representing yet another successful e-series product introduction. Contracts awards were secured in 2022 for XPak De liner hanger operations in Brazil, US, and Guyana. Dril-Quip also celebrated our first liner hanger installation of XPak in Guyana in 2022 and contract awards for first operations in Suriname.


Over the course of the last several years Dril-Quip continued to meet new product milestones by delivering DXe hydraulic connectors and the installation of subsea wellhead systems, featuring the award-winning DXe profile, within the Norwegian North Sea sector. This added to the field history for the e-series technology that began with the installation of Dril-Quip’s first Horizontal Subsea Tree (HXT) in 2020. Dril-Quip also continued research and development efforts within the Subsea Wellhead System and Subsea Product System product lines. The Company completed development of high pressure sub-mudline supplemental hanger systems and delivered them with its SS-20 BB-IIe subsea wellhead system, which accommodates higher pressures and provides greater flexibility in casing well programs. Dril-Quip has also been awarded the Offshore Technology Conference’s Spotlight on New Technology Award for several of its innovative products, namely the BADGeR specialty casing connector, and the VXTe self-aligning Subsea Tree technology. The BADGeR connector features a hands-free anti-rotation device that automatically engages and enables remote make-up operations that removes rig personnel from the red zone. By lowering operating costs and providing superior fatigue and metal sealing performance, it aligns and joins Dril-Quip’s e-Series product family that have also been recognized for technological innovation and customer benefits. The VXTe self-aligning technology uses a self-aligning mandrel to passively align the subsea tree to the tubing hanger, without regard to the tubing hanger’s orientation in the wellhead. Dril-Quip’s VXTe system provides oil companies with an opportunity to reduce their carbon footprint by reducing the amount of equipment and time required for subsea completions when compared to those activities today.
 Dril-Quip’s continued efforts in developing technologically advanced products enable Dril-Quip to offer products for the harshest environments. The latest subsea wellhead system utilized by a major oil company for its high pressure, high temperature applications was installed at the end of 2021, further strengthening Dril-Quip’s position in the subsea market. A contract for the same system was also awarded in late 2021 by a major oil company in Brazil.
 Dril-Quip has numerous U.S. registered trademarks, including Dril-Quip®, Quik-Thread®, Quik-Stab®, Multi-Thread®, MS-15®, SS-15®, SS-10®, SU-90®, DX® and TIW®. The Company has registered its trademarks in the countries where such registration is deemed material.
 Although in the aggregate, the Company’s patents and trademarks are of considerable importance to the manufacturing and marketing of many of its products, the Company does not consider any single patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks to be material to its business as a whole, except the Dril-Quip® trademark. The Company also relies on trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information. The Company routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and suppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not independently obtain similar information or otherwise gain access to the Company’s trade secrets.
 Competition
 Dril-Quip faces significant competition from other manufacturers and suppliers of exploration and production equipment. Several of its primary competitors are diversified multinational companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than those of the Company and which, in many instances, have been engaged in the manufacturing business for a much longer period of time than the Company. The Company competes principally with the petroleum production equipment segments of Baker Hughes; Schlumberger, Ltd.; TechnipFMC plc; and Aker Solutions.
 Because of their relative size and diversity of products, several of the Company’s competitors have the ability to provide “turnkey” services for drilling and production applications, which enables them to use their own products to the exclusion of Dril-Quip’s products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—We may be unable to successfully compete with other manufacturers of drilling and production equipment.” The Company also competes to a lesser extent with a number of other companies in various products. The principal competitive factors in the petroleum drilling and production equipment markets are quality, reliability and reputation of the product, price, technology, service and timely delivery.
Talent and Human Capital Management
 We believe that building a diverse, inclusive, engaged and empowered workforce will enable us to manage our business with a focus on health and safety, the environment, ethical behavior, quality and being a good corporate citizen in all countries in which we operate. Our people are the key to achieving our vision, and nurturing a transparent, collaborative and development focused culture drives alignment with our business strategy to achieve sustainable long-term shareholder value. We aim to attract and retain the right talent with the competencies and motivation required to execute our business strategy. Our global human capital strategy drives a consistent approach to human capital management and provides tools to facilitate employee development. Performance management and leadership succession are a key part of our people development process that helps identify and develop future leadership talent. Annually, our board provides oversight to the leadership succession process using our human capital analytics on workforce demographics, diversity and inclusion and hiring and attrition rates. These metrics are tracked, and progress is measured at cascading levels of the organization.
Core Values and Culture
 Fostering and maintaining a strong, healthy culture is a key strategic focus. Our core values reflect who we are and the way our employees interact with one another, our customers, suppliers and shareholders. We believe in doing the right thing always. Ethics and integrity are the foundation of our brand and the guiding principles for all we do. Safety and environment protection are our highest priorities. Our culture of collaboration helps to work together with customers to provide the best solution with our innovative technology and services. Our transparent culture facilitates open communication, feedback, and helps build trust.
 Employees
The total number of the Company's employees as of December 31, 2022 was 1,356, a 1.0% increase from December 31, 2021. Of those 1,356 employees, 581 were located in the United States. Substantially all of the Company’s employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, and the Company considers its employee relations to be good. At the end of fiscal year 2022, the Company’s global workforce was 85.8% male and 14.2% female. In the U.S., ethnicity of our workforce was 44.2% White, 34.1% Hispanic, 9.3% Asian, 8.4% Black and 4.0% Other. As a manufacturing organization, our workforce is made up of a high percentage of roles that are predominantly held by male workers such as welders, machinists, and workshop and offshore technicians.
The Company’s operations depend in part on its ability to attract quality employees. We provide employee wages and salaries that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. While the Company believes that its wage and salary rates are competitive and that its relationship with its labor force is good, a significant increase in the wages and salaries paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of the Company’s labor force, increases in the wage and salary rates paid by the Company or both. If either of these events were to occur, in the near-term, the profits realized by the Company from work in progress would be reduced and, in the long-term, the production capacity and profitability of the Company could be diminished and the growth potential of the Company could be impaired. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Loss of our key management or other personnel could adversely impact our business.”
Diversity and Inclusion
 Our culture is underpinned by our core values, including our commitment to inclusion and diversity. We have developed our diversity, equity and inclusion framework to further emphasize our vision, values and strategic objectives to support our talent strategy and desired cultural alignment. Diversity in our workplace broadens thinking and stimulates innovation. A more diverse workplace impacts how we act and what we do and opens our minds to be more creative and collaborative. The Company has implemented several measures that focus on accountability for making progress in diversity. The Company has partnered with non-profit and community organizations to support and develop a diverse talent pipeline. The Company’s commitment to diversity recruiting includes partnering with a number of universities, non-profit and community organizations to support and develop a diverse talent pipeline. In their workforce planning forecasts, the Company’s business units are developing initiatives and goals to recruit diverse talent across all leadership and skill areas. The Company also trains its recruiting workforce in diversity sourcing strategies and partners with external organizations that develop and supply diverse talent pipeline.
 As part of our diversity and inclusion efforts, we implemented a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion framework and launched Cultivating Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at work and Unconscious Bias training programs. These programs are aimed at driving further alignment to reduce unconscious bias in our hiring and other employment practices and to build our network of diversity champions among our employees, managers, and executives.
The Women Empowerment Network (WEN) organized several health, wellness and career related programs to support a women’s peer network with a focus on furthering career development opportunities. Our commitment to supporting communities to further improve employee engagement has resulted in overwhelming response to volunteering efforts. Our global employees have come together and have contributed during natural disaster relief work to supporting several local charity events.
Employee Development
 The attraction, development and retention of employees is a critical success factor for the Company. To support the advancement of all of our employees, we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within. We leverage both formal and informal programs to identify, foster, and retain top talent at both the corporate and operating unit level. Various internship programs and informal mentoring demonstrate the Company’s ongoing commitment and initiatives towards accelerating our future leaders. The executive team also commits substantial time in evaluating the talent of our leadership team with a focus on addressing leadership gaps through executive coaching and mentoring. To help determine whether we meet our goal of providing a rich experience for our employees, we measure organizational culture and engagement which help us build on the competencies that are important for our future success. We periodically engage independent third parties to conduct cultural and employee engagement surveys. These include corporate culture assessments, as well as real-time feedback on employee engagement and employee well-being focused on physical, emotional, social and financial health.
Competitive Compensation
 Dril-Quip’s compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with the Company’s performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:
  We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location.
 We engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry.
  We align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance.
 Annual increases and incentive compensation are based on merit, which is communicated to employees at the time of hiring and documented through our talent management process as part of our annual review procedures and upon internal transfer and/or promotion.
Employee Benefits
 We have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with shareholders, restricted stock units are provided to eligible employees under our broad-based stock incentive programs. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive and locally relevant and innovative benefits to all eligible employees worldwide. In the U.S, these include, among other benefits:
  Comprehensive health insurance coverage is offered to employees working an average of 20 hours or more each week
  Company paid group dental and vision care
  The Company sponsors a defined-contribution (cash balance) 401(k) plan covering domestic employees and a defined-contribution pension plan covering certain foreign employees
  Short-term and long-term disability benefits are provided to all full-time employees for added income protection
 Health Savings Account (HSA) and Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)
  Company paid life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment benefits
  Employee assistance program for concerns or emotional issues surrounding personal or work life. Unlimited access toconsultants by telephone and tools online for help with short-term problems
  Parental leaves are provided to all new parents for birth, adoption or foster placement.
Health, Safety and Environment
 Our people are our greatest asset and a key driver to our success in Health, Safety and Environment (HSE). Our HSE policy includes a commitment to provide safe and healthy working conditions for the prevention of work-related injury and ill health and is appropriate for the purpose, size and context of the organization. We established the Goal Zero program which requires each employee to hold themselves and those around them to the highest levels of safety, awareness and self-discipline. Goal Zero advocates conducting each activity in a manner that assures a safe outcome for ourselves, our co-workers and our families. Our vision is to create an environment where every employee embraces HSE as a core value and engages in Goal Zero. As part of our HSE policy we aim to identify and remediate any work practices that pose an HSE risk to our employees. The Company is devoted to creating a sustainable environment and implementing process improvements for both health and safety and the environment in the countries we operate. We evaluate our processes to ensure our protection schemes and work practices minimize these risks. Furthermore, we periodically evaluate our HSE objectives to remain aligned with our HSE goals and annually create a strategy focused on risk reduction to get us closer to zero incidents. This is the foundation on which Goal Zero is built as it shows commitment to identifying and controlling risk.
Employee Turnover
 We continually monitor employee turnover rates, both regionally and globally, as our success depends upon retaining our highly trained manufacturing and operating personnel. We believe the combination of competitive compensation and career growth and development opportunities help increase employee tenure and reduce voluntary turnover. Voluntary workforce turnover (rolling 12-month attrition) was 14.6% in December 2022. The average tenure of our employees is approximately 9 years, and about 43% of our employees have been employed by us for more than ten years.
Employee Recruitment
 The Company works diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with trade schools, world-class universities, professional associations and industry groups to proactively attract talent. The Company has a strong employee value proposition that leverages our unique culture, collaborative working environment, shared sense of purpose, desire to do the right thing and entrepreneurial spirit to attract talent to our Company.
Governmental Regulations
 Many aspects of the Company’s operations are affected by political developments and are subject to both domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including those relating to oilfield operations, the discharge of materials into the environment from our manufacturing or other facilities, health and worker safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection. In addition, the Company depends on the demand for its products and services from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, is affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry in general, including those specifically directed to onshore and offshore operations. The adoption of new laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws or regulations, that curtail exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for economic or other policy reasons, could adversely affect the Company’s operations by limiting demand for its products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our operations and our customers’ operations are subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.”
 In recent years, increased concern has been raised over the protection of the environment. Legislation to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases has been introduced, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the annual United Nations Climate Change Conferences. In November 2015, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) was held in Paris with the goal to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2 C (Celsius), from all nations, regardless of size. The Paris Agreement, signed by the U.S. on April 22, 2016, requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, every five years. Although the Trump administration had withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020, the Biden administration officially reentered the U.S. in the Paris Agreement in February 2021. In April 2021, the Biden administration announced a new goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% economy-wide by 2030 compared to 2005. In November 2021, the United States and other countries entered into the Glasgow Climate Pact, which includes a range of measures designed to address climate change, including but not limited to the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, reducing methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and cooperating toward the advancement of the development of clean energy. With the United States recommitting to the Paris Agreement, executive orders may be issued or federal legislation or regulatory initiatives may be adopted to achieve the agreement’s goals. Additionally, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which contains tax inducements and other provisions that incentivize investment, development, and deployment of alternative energy sources and technologies, which could increase operating costs within the oil and gas industry and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels.
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has undertaken efforts to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions and their effects. Following a finding by the EPA that certain greenhouse gases represent a danger to human health, the EPA expanded its regulations relating to those emissions and adopted rules imposing permitting and reporting obligations. The results of the permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of these greenhouse gases by the EPA. Moreover, specific design and operational standards apply to U.S. outer continental shelf vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles, structures and equipment.

The U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) regulates the design and operation of well control and other equipment at offshore production sites, among other requirements. BSEE has adopted stricter requirements for subsea drilling production equipment. In April 2016, BSEE published a final blowout preventer systems and well control rule, which focuses on blowout preventer requirements and includes reforms in well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring and subsea containment, among other things. BSEE also finalized a rule in September 2016 concerning production safety systems for oil and natural gas operations on the Outer Continental Shelf. However, in December 2017, BSEE published a proposed rule that would revise a number of the requirements in the September 2016 rule. The final rule implementing these revisions was published in September 2018. Subsequently, on May 2, 2019, BSEE issued the 2019 Well Control Rule, the revised well control and blowout preventer rule governing Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) activities. The new rule revised the then existing regulations impacting offshore oil and gas drilling, completions, workovers, and decommissioning activities. Specifically, the 2019 Well Control Rule addresses six areas of offshore operations: well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring, and subsea containment. The revisions were targeted to ensure safety and environmental protection while correcting errors in the 2016 rule and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden. In addition, drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. For example, in December 2016, the Obama administration banned offshore drilling in portions of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. Although the Trump administration announced a proposal in January 2018 to open most U.S. coastal waters to offshore drilling, several coastal states have taken steps to prohibit offshore drilling. For example, California passed laws in September 2018 barring the construction of new oil drilling-related infrastructure in state waters. Similarly, in November 2018, voters in Florida approved an amendment to the state constitution that would ban oil and gas drilling in offshore state waters. Further, in December 2018, environmental groups challenged incidental harassment authorizations issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service that allow companies to conduct air gun seismic surveys for oil and gas exploration off the Atlantic coast. The attorneys general for nine coastal states also sought to intervene as plaintiffs.
In January 2021, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior issued an order preventing staff from producing any new fossil fuel leases or permits without sign-off from a top political appointee, and President Biden announced a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices, including consideration of whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters or other appropriate action to account for corresponding climate costs. A federal court in the Western District of Louisiana issued a preliminary injunction on this moratorium. Pursuant to the order, in November 2021, the Department of the Interior released a report identifying potential reforms to the federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. President Biden’s order also established climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security consideration, affirms that achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or before midcentury is a critical priority, affirms the Biden Administration’s desire to establish the United States as a leader in addressing climate change, generally further integrates climate change and environmental justice considerations into government agencies’ decision-making, and eliminates fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures. In August 2022, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the preliminary injunction on the moratorium and, subsequently, the Western District of Louisiana permanently enjoined the moratorium as limited to the 13 states that filed a lawsuit against the action.
 Other parties are also pursuing lawsuits to stop or restrict offshore drilling. For example, on January 27, 2022, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia found that Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s failure to calculate the potential emissions from foreign oil consumption had violated the agency’s approval of oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico under the National Environmental Policy Act, and the decision is currently on appeal in the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 30, 2022, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals also found two previous oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico were unlawful for failure to properly analyze risk under the National Environmental Policy Act. These decisions may disrupt or delay drilling operations if the agency is forced to reassess the environmental impacts of the Gulf of Mexico drilling program.
 
In March 2018, the President of the United States issued a proclamation imposing a 25 percent global tariff on imports of certain steel products, effective March 23, 2018. The President subsequently proposed an additional 25 percent tariff on approximately $50 billion worth of imports from China, and the government of China responded with a proposal of an additional 25 percent tariff on U.S. goods with a value of $50 billion. The initial U.S. tariffs were implemented on July 6, 2018, covering $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, with another $16 billion of goods facing tariffs beginning on August 23, 2018.
 

In September 2018, the President directed the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to place additional tariffs on approximately $200 billion worth of additional imports from China. These tariffs, which took effect on September 24, 2018, were initially set at a level of 10 percent until the end of the year, at which point the tariffs were to rise to 25 percent. However, on December 19, 2018, USTR postponed the date on which the rate of the additional duties would increase to 25 percent until March 2, 2019. On May 9, 2019, USTR announced that the United States increased the level of tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on approximately $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The President also ordered USTR to begin the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from China, which are valued at approximately $300 billion. On August 13, 2019 and August 23, 2019, USTR announced the imposition of an additional tariff of 15 percent on approximately $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, effective September 1, 2019 (or December 15, 2019 for certain articles). Following the conclusion of a phase one trade deal with China, USTR suspended the implementation of the 15 percent additional duty on approximately $160 billion worth of Chinese imports and reduced the applicable duty from 15 percent to 7.5 percent for $120 billion worth of Chinese imports. Negotiations for a phase two trade deal with China had begun prior to the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic and if continued could lead to additional changes to the tariff rates described above.
President Biden has indicated that these tariffs will likely remain in place while the new administration assesses the United States’ current posture, including a review of the phase one trade deal with China. The imposition of any additional tariffs or initiation of trade restrictions by or against the United States could cause our cost of raw materials to increase or affect the markets for our products. However, given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of these trade actions by the United States and other countries, their ultimate impact on our business and operations remains uncertain.
 In November 2018, the United States, Mexico and Canada signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The three countries have all ratified the new agreement, and on July 1, 2020, the USMCA became effective.
 To the extent that new laws or other governmental actions prohibit or restrict drilling or impose additional environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the drilling industry in particular, the business of the Company could be adversely affected. Similarly, restrictions on authorizations needed to conduct seismic surveys could impact our customers’ ability to identify oil and gas reserves, thereby reducing demand for our products. The Company cannot determine to what extent its future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations. Compliance with any new laws, regulations or other legal initiatives could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business and financial condition. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.”
 Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations related to workplace safety and worker health, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
 Based on the Company’s experience to date, the Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its business or consolidated financial position as a result of future compliance with existing environmental, health and safety laws. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of or by regulatory agencies, or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by the Company, which may be material.
