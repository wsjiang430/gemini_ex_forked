Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative medicines that target the biology of aging to prevent or treat age-related diseases with the potential to extend healthy lifespan. Our lead program selectively inhibits the target of rapamycin complex 1, or TORC1, an evolutionarily conserved pathway that contributes to the decline in function of multiple organ systems. Our lead product candidate, RTB101, is an oral, selective, and potent inhibitor of TORC1. RTB101 inhibits the phosphorylation of multiple targets downstream of TORC1. Inhibition of TORC1 has been observed to extend lifespan and healthspan in aging preclinical species and to enhance immune, neurologic and cardiac functions, suggesting potential benefits in several aging-related diseases. We have successfully completed a Phase 2b clinical trial in our initial indication to reduce the incidence of respiratory tract infections, or RTIs, in the elderly regardless of the causative pathogen, and based on communications to date, including an end of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we plan to initiate Phase 3 clinical trials in the second quarter of 2019.
 The decline in immune function that occurs during aging, or immunosenescence, increases susceptibility to a variety of diseases, including RTIs, that significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Our initial focus is on the development of RTB101 as a first-in-class immunotherapy designed to improve immune function and thereby reduce respiratory illness in the elderly regardless of the causative pathogen. Our TORC1 immunotherapy approach is supported by two randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials which enrolled more than 900 elderly subjects and provided statistically significant (defined as nominal p < 0.05) and clinically meaningful results. In 2018, we reported results from our exploratory dose-ranging randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial in 652 elderly patients at increased risk of RTI-associated morbidity and mortality defined as aged 85 and over, or 65-84 with one or more comorbidities including: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or T2DM, or current smoker.
 The results from this trial demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 30.6% reduction in the percentage of patients with one or more laboratory-confirmed RTIs, the primary endpoint of the trial, in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort compared to the placebo cohort. Prespecified analyses of the patient populations enrolled in the trial demonstrated (i) a statistically significant 52.1% reduction in the percentage of patients with severe laboratory-confirmed RTI symptoms in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort compared to the placebo cohort, (ii) a statistically significant 66.7%, 68.9%, and 25.3% reduction in the prespecified endpoint of patients 85 and older, 65 and older with asthma and 65 and older with T2DM, respectively, with one or more laboratory-confirmed RTIs in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort compared to the placebo cohort, and (iii) no reduction in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed RTIs in patients who were current smokers or with COPD in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort compared to the placebo cohort. The lack of efficacy observed in current smokers and patients with COPD is consistent with pre-clinical data suggesting that mTOR inhibition exacerbates cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammation in COPD. The combination of RTB101+everolimus and the RTB101 10 mg twice daily did not meet the primary endpoint, suggesting that less TORC1 inhibition with RTB101 10 mg once daily may be more beneficial for reducing the incidence of RTIs in high risk elderly patients. We believe the collective results from our Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials enrolling more than 900 elderly subjects suggest that RTB101 10 mg once daily, if successfully developed and approved, may improve the function of the aging immune system and reduce the incidence of clinically symptomatic respiratory illness in elderly patients. In our planned Phase 3 program, we expect to enroll elderly subjects 65 and older, excluding current smokers and COPD patients.
 We observed additional positive results from prespecified analyses for any infection and urinary tract infections, or UTIs, in our Phase 2b trial, such as (i) a statistically significant 23.6% reduction in the percentage of patients with any infection in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort compared to the placebo cohort, (ii) a statistically significant 74.6% reduction in the percentage of patients with one or more UTIs in the RTB101 10 mg twice daily cohort and (iii) a 34.4% reduction in patients with one or more UTIs in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort. Recent scientific findings, including those published in the scientific journals Cell, Nature and Science, suggest that aging and aging-related conditions, such as immunosenescence, may be attributable not only to random cellular wear and tear, but also to specific intra-cellular signaling pathways, including the mTOR pathway. mTOR is a protein kinase that signals via two multiprotein complexes, known as

TORC1 and TORC2. TORC1 inhibition has been observed to prolong lifespan, enhance immune function, ameliorate heart failure, enhance memory and mobility, decrease adiposity, and delay the onset of aging-related diseases in multiple animal studies. Specifically, with respect to enhanced immune function, TORC1 inhibition was observed in preclinical studies to rejuvenate blood, or hematopoietic, stem cell function, increase infection-fighting white blood cell production and enhance antibody-mediated, or adaptive, immunity. On the other hand, TORC2 inhibition has been observed to decrease lifespan in preclinical studies and cause unwanted side effects of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in certain animals and humans. Therefore, based on these observations and data from more than 900 patients enrolled in our Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials, we believe our TORC1 program has the potential to improve immune function and counteract immunosenescence in the elderly.
 The reduced ability of elderly subjects to effectively detect and fight infections is most commonly manifested in their susceptibility to RTIs and the negative effects such infections have on their overall health. RTIs are the second leading cause of hospitalization in people age 85 and over, and the fourth leading cause in people age 65 and over, contributing to high healthcare costs that are three to five times higher than for the elderly population than for the younger population. Furthermore, antibiotics, which are ineffective against viruses, are often prescribed indiscriminately to treat RTIs, which may cause side effects and contribute to the growing global problem of antibiotic resistance. As the elderly represent the fastest growing population in the world, we believe there is significant unmet medical need for innovative therapeutic options for reducing the incidence of RTIs by improving the function of the aging immune system.
 We believe our approach to addressing RTIs in the elderly possesses several clinical and commercial advantages. Our TORC1 program offers an immunotherapy approach that has the potential to address a broad range of viral and bacterial pathogens. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in RTI incidence were observed in our Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials with RTB101 10mg once daily. We believe the risk-to-benefit ratio of our program observed in clinical studies to date is well-suited to the elderly due to the following observations: our oral product candidates were well-tolerated in elderly subjects, none of the participants in the active treatment arms experienced a serious adverse event that was related to the study drug, and the doses being investigated in our Phase 2b clinical trial were 60 to 240 times lower than maximum tolerated doses established in prior clinical trials for other indications. Based on communications to date with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, including an end of Phase 2 meeting, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical program in the second quarter of 2019. We plan to conduct pivotal clinical trials and to seek regulatory approval for commercialization of RTB101 in the United States and Europe. Separate pivotal trials may be conducted to support potential approvals in Japan and China. In some markets, we may collaborate with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
 We licensed the worldwide rights to our TORC1 program, including RTB101 alone or in combination with everolimus, from Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Novartis, in March 2017. Our management team includes our co-founders, Chen Schor, who serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, Joan Mannick, M.D., who serves as our Chief Medical Officer, Meredith Manning, who serves as our Chief Commercial Officer, and additional veterans in drug development and discovery, with executive experience in leading global pharmaceutical companies. Dr. Mannick led the TORC1 clinical program at Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Inc., or NIBR, prior to our in-licensing of the program. We are supported by investors that include both private equity venture capital funds and public healthcare investment funds.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to be a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on treating aging-related diseases. We strive to maintain a leadership position in the TORC1 inhibitor class of pharmaceutical products for aging-related diseases. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include:

• | Rapidly advance our TORC1 program as immunotherapy for reducing the incidence of clinically symptomatic respiratory illness in elderly subjects. In July 2018, we reported positive topline data from our Phase 2b clinical trial of RTB101 alone and in combination with everolimus in elderly subjects at increased risk of mortality and morbidity due to RTIs. In that trial, RTB101 10 mg once daily reduced the incidence of RTI by 30.6% in the populations studied in the trial. Based on the topline results and communications to date including an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we plan to initiate pivotal clinical trials in the second quarter of 2019 where we will study RTB101 10 mg once daily in subjects 65 years and older, excluding current smokers and COPD patients. The goal of the pivotal trials is to potentially submit an application for regulatory approval of RTB101 in the United States, Europe and additional countries.

• | Develop our TORC1 program for additional indications. We also intend to develop RTB101, alone or in combination with a rapalog, such as everolimus and sirolimus, for the treatment of additional aging-related diseases based on preclinical and clinical evidence on the effects of TORC1 inhibition. We believe that there is strong rationale to support the investigation of RTB101, alone or in combination with a rapalog, for the

prevention and treatment of additional aging-related indications, including other infections, for example, urinary tract infections, neurodegenerative diseases and heart failure.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercialize our product candidates in the United States and potentially collaborate with others globally to maximize their commercial value. We plan to directly commercialize our product candidates in the United States with a sales force mainly targeting pulmonologists and geriatricians with a high flow of patients 65 years of age and above. We may consider collaborating with third parties to broaden the distribution of our product candidates in the United States. In other markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates. We believe there are significant opportunities to market RTB101, if approved, in Europe and Japan, which we may choose to pursue in collaboration with others.

• | Maintain and grow a robust intellectual property portfolio in the field of TORC1 inhibition for aging-related diseases. We have an exclusive license to ten patent families directed to compositions of matter, methods of use and formulations covering RTB101 alone or in combination with everolimus and have filed additional method of use patent applications. We intend to aggressively pursue and maintain broad intellectual property protection for RTB101 alone or in combination with a rapalog, such as everolimus or sirolimus, or other compounds for the prevention of RTIs and the prevention or treatment of other aging-related diseases through U.S. and international patents.

• | Develop, acquire or in-license product candidates that enhance our global leadership position. We have additional TORC1 inhibitor compounds in discovery that we may develop, and we may acquire or in-license other product candidates targeting TORC1 and other pathways that regulate aging to support our goal to be the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of aging-related diseases.

Our Product Pipeline 
 The following table summarizes key information about our product candidates.

*For heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and certain other infections, we may be required to file an investigational new drug application, or IND, prior to initiating Phase 2 clinical trials. We expect to have the ability to initiate these Phase 2 clinical trials without the need to conduct prior Phase 1 clinical trials.
 Aging and its Regulation by the mTOR Pathway 
 Advances in the scientific understanding of aging have until recently been limited, despite high growth in the elderly population 
 The elderly are the fastest growing population around the globe. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population age 65 and older in the United States is expected to double by 2050 compared to 2012 estimates. According to global census data, there are nearly 150 million people age 65 and older, and approximately 20 million people age 85 years 
 3

and older in the United States, the major European countries and Japan. Despite age being the major risk factor for multiple chronic diseases, we believe few therapies are being developed to target the aging immune system, and none have been approved.
 mTOR is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that regulates aging
 mTOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates the process of aging and aging-related diseases and conditions. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway has been observed to prolong lifespan in multiple animals. These data support the potential for drugs that target the mTOR pathway to have therapeutic benefits for aging and aging-related conditions in humans.
 In preclinical studies, the mTOR pathway has been observed to be hyperactivated in some cell types, including hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, at an advanced age. It was observed that suppressing mTOR activity in these cell types to levels found at younger ages may enhance cell function, including their ability to generate white blood cells. Furthermore, preclinical studies found that mTOR activity stimulates protein synthesis and cell growth but inhibits protective processes such as autophagy in which damaged proteins and organelles are broken down and recycled. Therefore, these studies suggest that increased mTOR activity is beneficial during years of growth and reproduction but may be harmful during post-reproductive years when cells accumulate damage and require protective mechanisms such as autophagy to prevent and repair damage.
 mTOR signals via two multiprotein complexes, known as TORC1 and TORC2. TORC1 inhibition has been observed to prolong lifespan, enhance immune responses, ameliorate neurodegenerative diseases, ameliorate heart failure, enhance memory and mobility, decrease adiposity and delay onset of aging-related diseases in multiple animal studies. On the other hand, TORC2 inhibition has been observed to decrease lifespan and cause hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in certain animals and humans. Therefore, we believe the optimal approach for the treatment of aging-related conditions through mTOR inhibition is a regimen that inhibits TORC1 without inhibiting TORC2. mTOR within the TORC1 complex introduces phosphates to, or phosphorylates, multiple proteins including S6K, 4EBP1 and Ulk1, as shown in the figure below. Different dosing regimens that inhibit different spectrum of TORC1, as measured by decreased phosphorylation of multiple proteins downstream of TORC1, may be more beneficial for the prevention or treatment of certain aging-related diseases.

We believe TORC1 inhibition may have therapeutic benefit in multiple aging-related diseases. Preclinical studies suggest that key mechanisms involved in the anti-aging effects of TORC1 inhibition include improved stem cell function, increased autophagy, increased expression of mitochondrial proteins that are important for energy production, decreased adiposity and increased expression of proteins that are responsible for cellular maintenance and repair. Based on preclinical data, these biological effects have the potential to improve multiple aging-related pathologies:
  
1. | Decreased immune function and increased risk of infections. The immune system has several important functions, including protection against harmful pathogens, cancer immunosurveillance and clearance of senescent cells. Innate immunity is the body’s first line of defense against a wide range of pathogens, while
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

adaptive immunity is a more pathogen-specific immune response that develops over time. Immune cells are produced by HSCs in the bone marrow, which can lose functionality with age. In preclinical studies, aged dendritic cells, a type of innate immune cell, demonstrated defective Type 1 interferon production, a central component of anti-viral immunity, in response to a virus. This response is consistent with the observation that dendritic cells from older subjects produced less interferon upon stimulation with a virus than those from younger subjects. Adaptive immunity also declines with age. The number and functionality of certain white blood cells known as lymphocytes, including antibody-producing B lymphocytes, have been observed to be decreased in elderly human subjects. We believe that this decline in immune function contributes to the higher incidence of common infections such as respiratory and urinary tract infections in the elderly.

2. | Decreased mitochondrial function and organ dysfunction. During aging, mitochondrial function, which is important for metabolism and energy production in cells, is diminished. This diminution is linked to a switch from more efficient fatty acid oxidation to less efficient glucose oxidation in aging organs. The detrimental nature of this metabolic change has been extensively described in animal and human studies of aging-related conditions, including heart failure.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Decreased autophagy and accumulation of damaged proteins. Autophagy is the process in which a cell breaks down and recycles damaged cellular components, including damaged and aggregated proteins. Preclinical data suggests that an aging-associated decrease in autophagy leads to the accumulation of toxic proteins and may result in aging-associated pathologies such as neurodegeneration.

Immunosenescence and Respiratory Tract Infections in the Elderly
 Potential for TORC1 inhibition to address decreased immune function associated with aging
 TORC1 inhibition has been observed to enhance immune function in at least three independent preclinical studies to date, conducted by laboratories at the University of Michigan, Emory University and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, where administration of mTOR inhibitors improved immune response to influenza vaccination. Further, findings from these preclinical studies suggest that short-term treatment of aged animals with a TORC1 inhibitor can rejuvenate HSC function, increase the number of infection-fighting white blood cells, and increase longevity. A recent study conducted by laboratories at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital also showed that RTB101 improved survival in mice treated with a lethal dose of influenza virus. We believe these findings, as well as results from our Phase 2 clinical studies, suggest that TORC1 inhibition has the potential to improve immune function and reduce the incidence of clinically symptomatic respiratory illness in elderly humans.
 Respiratory tract infections in the elderly 
 The reduced ability of the aging immune system to effectively detect and fight infections results in increased susceptibility of the elderly to RTIs, which, in turn negatively impacts such patients’ overall health and quality of life. We believe that decreasing the incidence of RTIs is a large unmet medical need in the elderly, particularly in subjects at an increased risk of RTI-related morbidity and mortality. We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for an innovative therapy to reduce the incidence of RTIs in the elderly for the following reasons:
  
• | The large and growing elderly population is particularly susceptible to morbidity and mortality from RTIs. The elderly represent the fastest growing population across the globe. In the United States, RTIs are the second leading cause of hospitalizations in people age 85 and over and the fourth leading cause of hospitalizations in people age 65 and over. Mortality among people age 75 and over is highest each year during winter cold and flu season. Age is a risk factor for RTIs, with men aged 85-89 experiencing lower RTIs at twice the rate of men aged 65-69. As a result, RTIs, which are typically not serious in healthy adults, are exacerbated in the elderly. Approximately 62% of elderly aged 65 and older have comorbidities. Elderly patients with comorbidities may also be at a higher risk of morbidity and mortality due to RTIs as compared to healthy elderly subjects. Comorbidities among the elderly are common, with approximately 7% having asthma, 20% having T2DM and 13% having congestive heart failure, or CHF. Prior to initiating the Phase 2b clinical trial, a market research study with five payors and 55 physicians in the United States was conducted. The results of the research provided further support that the results observed in the Phase 2a clinical trial are potentially clinically meaningful to physicians and that there is an unmet medical need in the elderly, particularly in the elderly at high risk of mortality from RTls. Phone interviews with payors also illustrated that, subject to FDA approval, payors may be able to include a product with our efficacy and safety profile

into a preferred tier on their formularies and may request a modest rebate. A more recent physician survey was also conducted in April 2018. We surveyed 100 physicians who treat 25,000 elderly patients monthly, which indicated that a therapeutic that reduced the incidence of RTIs by 25% would be considered to have clinically meaningful efficacy. Physicians in the survey would expect to prescribe a therapeutic that reduces the incidence of RTIs by 25-40% to 30-50% of their patients aged 65 and older with certain comorbidities or to patients 85 and older. Topline results from our Phase 2b trial demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the percentage of patients 65 years and older who are non-smokers and do not have COPD, with one or more laboratory-confirmed RTIs in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort compared to placebo. We expect to evaluate RTB101 in subjects 65 years of age and older that do not have COPD and do not smoke in our pivotal trials.

• | RTIs contribute to high healthcare burden and costs. RTIs are the second leading cause of hospitalization in people age 85 and over, and the fourth leading cause in people age 65 and over, contributing to high healthcare burdens and costs for the elderly population and the healthcare system that are three to five times higher than for the younger population. At least 11% of CHF exacerbations requiring hospitalization and 80% of asthma exacerbations are associated with RTIs. The risk of a cardiovascular event is three to six fold higher after the onset of an RTI than in the absence of infection. Approximately 7% of people aged 85 years and over go to the emergency room with RTIs each year. In addition, two-thirds of people aged 85 and over who go to the emergency room for infection-related reasons are hospitalized, and once hospitalized, one-third of people aged 85 and over are admitted to a nursing home. These statistics illustrate the large economic impact of RTIs on the healthcare system in the United States.

• | The majority of RTIs are caused by viruses for which no available therapy exists. The majority of RTIs are caused by viruses, most of which lack approved prophylactics or therapies, leaving physicians with few treatment options. Based on Center for Disease Control, or CDC, guidelines, vaccines are given to prevent influenza and pneumococcal infections. However, even if vaccinated, the elderly are less likely to develop sufficient protective immunity against influenza and pneumococcal infections due to immunosenescence. In addition, vaccines against most of the viral pathogens that cause RTIs are not currently available. The following figure illustrates the specific pathogens detected in patients 80 years or older hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Antibiotics are often prescribed indiscriminately to treat RTIs, leading to potential side effects and contributing to growing antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics, which are ineffective against viruses, are often prescribed indiscriminately to treat RTIs, which may cause side effects related to antibiotic use and contribute to the growing global problem of antibiotic resistance. As antibiotic use is a primary driver of antibiotic resistance, we believe that reducing the incidence of RTIs in the elderly could also indirectly limit the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, the elderly are at increased risk of antibiotic-related adverse events due to increased organ sensitivity, increased exposure due to changes in pharmacokinetics, and polypharmacy. According to a study conducted by McGill University, antibiotics have been linked to 17% of adverse drug-related events in the elderly who visit emergency departments. Antibiotic use can also lead to lethal superinfections such as C. difficile infections.

• | Lack of immunotherapy drugs to address RTIs. Immunotherapies ideally enhance the immune system to provide broad, acute and long-lasting protection against pathogens. Currently, however, there are no approved immunotherapies to enhance immune function in the elderly. We believe RTB101 is a potential immunotherapy aimed at enhancing immune function in the elderly, and thereby decreasing the incidence of clinically symptomatic respiratory illness associated with a broad spectrum of pathogens, particularly viral pathogens. In addition, beyond an individual level, we believe immunotherapies may benefit the wider population through indirect protection that occurs when a large percentage of the population has become immune to a disease, thereby preventing or limiting the spread of infection and providing a measure of protection for individuals who are not immune, a phenomenon known as herd immunity.

Our TORC1 Program 
 Overview 
 In March 2017, we obtained a license from Novartis to the worldwide rights to RTB101 for all indications, and the rights to use everolimus in combination with RTB101 for all aging-related indications. RTB101 is an orally administered, small molecule, potent TORC1 inhibitor that binds to the active site of mTOR on the TORC1 complex, a mechanism known as catalytic inhibition. In contrast, rapalogs, such as everolimus or sirolimus, also orally administered small molecules, inhibit mTOR activity by changing the shape of TORC1, a mechanism known as allosteric inhibition, that is distinct from and synergistic with catalytic inhibition.
 The downstream signaling cascade of TORC1 that we believe occurs in scenarios of baseline, RTB101 alone and RTB101 in combination with a rapalog, such as everolimus or sirolimus are pictured in the following figure. 

Our TORC1 program includes evaluation of RTB101 alone because we believe RTB101 monotherapy can effectively inhibit phosphorylation of multiple downstream signaling nodes of TORC1, specifically S6K and 4EBP1, that are key drivers of TORC1 downstream activity. Decreased phosphorylation of S6K leads to decreased activity, while decreased phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and Ulk1 leads to increased activity. We believe RTB101 alone consistently inhibits more downstream signaling nodes of TORC1 than a rapalog, such as everolimus or sirolimus, alone. Furthermore, we believe RTB101 at the low doses that we are evaluating in our clinical studies can achieve these effects without inhibiting TORC2. RTB101 at higher doses, while able to more completely inhibit TORC1, may also inhibit TORC2, which may lead to undesirable side effects.
 Our TORC1 program also includes evaluation of RTB101 in combination with a rapalog, such as everolimus or sirolimus, as the combination of catalytic and allosteric inhibitors may yield complete inhibition of all nodes downstream of TORC1, including 4EBP1 and Ulk1, without affecting TORC2. It was observed in preclinical in vitro studies that RTB101 and everolimus at the comparable doses that we are evaluating in our clinical trials synergistically inhibit S6K and 4EBP1 phosphorylation and induce autophagy. The synergy of RTB101 with everolimus or sirolimus, as measured by Bliss synergy scoring, was up to 150% in those studies. Bliss scores in excess of 30% are considered to be high. Additionally, we believe rapalogs, such as everolimus and sirolimus, may induce a conformation change in TORC1 that allows lower concentrations 
 7

of RTB101 to inhibit TORC1 without inhibiting TORC2. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that for some indications, such as reducing the incidence of clinically symptomatic respiratory illness, RTB101 monotherapy may be adequate to yield clinically meaningful benefit to patients, while for other indications, such as neurodegenerative disease and other autophagy-related diseases, the combination of RTB101 and a rapalog, such as everolimus or sirolimus, may be more beneficial. Accordingly, our TORC1 program includes evaluation of both RTB101 alone and in combination with a rapalog, such as everolimus or sirolimus.
 Clinical Development of RTB101
 Phase 2b Clinical Development
 We have completed dosing of all patients in an exploratory, dose-ranging, Phase 2b clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy with RTB101 alone or in combination with everolimus as compared to placebo in elderly patients at increased risk of RTI-related morbidity or mortality. The study enrolled 652 elderly subjects at increased risk of RTI-associated morbidity and mortality, defined as aged 85 and over, or 65-84 with one or more comorbidities or conditions including: asthma, COPD, T2DM, or current smoker. The study was a two-part randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted during winter cold and flu season in the southern hemisphere (Part 1) and northern hemisphere (Part 2). In Part 1, 179 elderly patients were randomized to receive either placebo, RTB101 5 mg or RTB101 10 mg once daily for 16 weeks. At the end of Part 1, an interim analysis was completed by an unblinded data monitoring committee which selected the RTB101 10 mg dose to move forward into Part 2 of the study. In Part 2, 473 elderly patients were randomized to receive either placebo, RTB101 10 mg once daily, RTB101 10 mg twice daily, or RTB101 10 mg in combination with everolimus 0.1 mg once daily. All patients were treated with study drug for 16 weeks, with an additional eight weeks of follow-up off study drug.
 The primary endpoint of the study was a reduction, as compared to placebo, in the percentage of patients with one or more laboratory-confirmed RTIs during 16 weeks of treatment. A prespecified exploratory endpoint was the reduction, as compared to placebo, in the percentage of patients with one or more laboratory-confirmed RTIs in each of the following patient subgroups: ≥85 years of age, or 65-84 years of age with asthma, COPD, T2DM, or current smoker. If not otherwise specified, we used a nominal 5% or lower p-value (p < 0.05) to define statistical significance for the clinical trials and data presented in this report.
 Based on a topline analysis of the primary endpoint, we observed:
  
• | A 30.6% reduction in the percentage of patients who developed one or more laboratory-confirmed RTIs in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort as compared to the placebo cohort (odds ratio, or OR, =0.601; p=0.025),
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To better understand the activity observed in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort, a prespecified analysis of each patient subgroup enrolled in the study was conducted. The following decreases in the percentage of patients with laboratory-confirmed RTIs were observed in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort as compared to the placebo cohort:
  
• | A 68.9% decrease in all asthma patients (OR=0.105; p=0.0001)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | A 66.7% decrease in all patients 85 years of age and older (OR=0.184; p=0.007)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A 25.3% decrease in all T2DM patients (OR=0.362; p=0.028)
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 No decrease in the percentage of patients with laboratory-confirmed RTIs was observed in either COPD patients or current smokers; the lack of efficacy observed in current smokers and patients with COPD is consistent with nonclinical data suggesting that mTOR inhibition exacerbates cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammation in COPD.
 The reductions in the percentage of patients with one or more laboratory-confirmed RTIs in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort for each patient subgroup in Part 1 and Part 2 are individually depicted in the figure below. The one-sided p-value to compare treatment effect between groups from a logistic regression model, adjusted for prior disease comorbidities and age, is also displayed.

Based on the above analysis of each patient subgroup, we define non-responders as patients with COPD or current smokers. The odds of experiencing laboratory-confirmed RTIs in subjects 65 and older who did not have COPD and are non-smokers are depicted in the figure below.

 In our planned Phase 3 clinical trials, we expect to evaluate RTB101 10 mg once daily treatment to reduce the percentage of subjects 65 years and older, excluding COPD patients and current smokers, with clinical symptoms consistent with an RTI. 
 Additional prespecified analyses of secondary and exploratory endpoints were also assessed in our Phase 2b trial:

 In the Phase 2b clinical trial, RTB101 treatment was observed to be well-tolerated. Adverse events, or AEs, were balanced between the RTB101 10 mg once daily and placebo treatment groups. One subject randomized to receive RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort died from traumatic injuries sustained from being hit by a car while riding a bicycle during the 16-week treatment period of the trial, and two subjects (one randomized to receive RTB101 10 mg twice daily and one randomized to receive placebo) died from unknown cause(s) after the week 24 follow-up visit of the trial.. None of the deaths that occurred was attributed to study drug treatment. 4.5% of subjects in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort and 7.8% of subjects in the placebo cohort had a serious adverse event, none of which were considered related to study drug. 5.1% of subjects in the RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort and 5.6% of subjects in the placebo cohort discontinued study drug due to an AE. All AEs were mild or moderate except for 12 severe AEs in RTB101 10 mg once daily cohort and 24 severe AEs in the placebo cohort.
 Phase 2a Clinical Development 
 Data from a Phase 2a clinical trial conducted by our licensor, Novartis, were published in July 2018 in Science Translational Medicine, and provide additional support for the efficacy and safety of our clinical program.
 The primary objectives of the Phase 2a clinical trial were to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of RTB101 alone or in combination with everolimus compared to placebo in enhancing the immune response to vaccination in elderly subjects, as determined by the subjects’ immune response to the seasonal influenza vaccine. A prespecified exploratory endpoint assessed the effect of a six-week course of RTB101 alone or in combination with everolimus on infection rates during the year following initiation of study drug treatment. The trial was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial that enrolled a total of 264 male and female subjects at least 65 years of age without underlying unstable medical conditions, and was conducted across 12 trial centers in the southern hemisphere. Subjects were randomized to one of five treatment arms, in which they were administered daily oral doses of everolimus 0.1 mg, everolimus 0.5 mg, RTB101 10 mg, RTB101 10 mg + everolimus 0.1 mg, or placebo. The trial met its primary endpoint of enhancing influenza vaccination response, defined as a greater than 20% increase in antibody concentrations, or titers, to at least two of the three tested influenza vaccine strains as compared to placebo, measured at 12 weeks following initial dosing of the study drug, as well as the prespecified exploratory infection rate endpoint.
 Subjects were treated for six weeks with the study drug and, after a two-week drug-free interval, were given the seasonal influenza vaccine. The subjects were followed for one year following initiation of study drug treatment. The overall infection rate in each treatment group was assessed by having subjects record any infections they experienced during the year following the initiation of study drug treatment in a diary. The sites reviewed the infection diary at each study visit. In addition, sites administered infection questionnaires during phone calls with subjects that occurred weekly during the six-week study drug dosing period and then monthly for the remainder of the trial. Investigators reviewed and approved the 
 12

information contained in the telephone questionnaire reports within 24 hours. The infection data in the diaries and telephone reports were reconciled by sites prior to entering infections in the clinical trial database.
 In the RTB101 monotherapy and RTB101 + everolimus combination treatment arms in the intent-to-treat population, statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in the annual rate of infections of 33% (p=0.008) and 38% (p=0.001), respectively, compared to placebo, were observed. A lesser, non-statistically significant effect was observed with everolimus monotherapy.

Since the most common infections that occurred during the trial were RTIs, a post-hoc analysis was performed to determine whether a reduction in RTIs contributed to the significant reduction in infections at one year following initiation of study drug treatment in the RTB101 monotherapy and RTB101 + everolimus combination treatment arms. As shown in the figure below, both RTB101 monotherapy and the RTB101 + everolimus combination therapy were observed to reduce the incidence of RTIs at one year by 42% (p=0.006) and 36% (p=0.01), respectively, in the intent-to-treat population. Greater reductions in the incidence of RTIs were observed during the six-week dosing period in the RTB101 monotherapy and RTB101 + everolimus combination arms. Given that the magnitude of the reduction in RTI incidence was greater at six weeks than at one year, these findings suggest that the reduction in RTI rates was greatest during the period when subjects were receiving the study drug. The typical duration of the peak cold and flu season is approximately 16 weeks. As shown in the figure below, analysis of the Phase 2a clinical data also revealed reductions of 45% (p=0.039) and 50% (p=0.013) in RTIs from treatment with RTB101 alone and in combination with everolimus, respectively, during the 16 weeks following initiation of therapy despite only six weeks of treatment.

13

To assess possible molecular mechanisms underlying the decrease in infection rates in the RTB101 monotherapy and RTB101 + everolimus combination treatment arms, mRNA sequencing analysis of whole blood from subjects at baseline and after six weeks of study drug treatment was conducted. Analysis of whole-blood gene expression data revealed a highly statistically significant up-regulation of pathways related to interferon signaling in the RTB101 monotherapy and RTB101 + everolimus combination treatment arms but not in the placebo arm, as shown in the figures below. These findings suggest that RTB101 alone and in combination with everolimus may improve innate immunity. Genes that were up-regulated the most, including MX1, OAS3, ISG15 and IFIT1, encode a subset of Type 1 interferon-induced proteins that play a critical role in the acute, innate immune response to viruses. Pathways, or groups of genes, related to cytokine signaling and interferon signaling were significantly upregulated, with p-values ranging between 10-45 to 10-10.

While the effects of RTB101 monotherapy and RTB101 + everolimus combination therapy on reducing the incidence of RTIs in the elderly and up-regulating innate immunity genes were comparable, only the combination therapy met the primary endpoint of the Phase 2a clinical trial of enhancing influenza vaccination response, defined as a greater than 20% increase in antibody concentrations, or titers, to at least two of the three tested influenza vaccine strains as compared to placebo, measured at 12 weeks following initial dosing of the study drug. We believe these results suggest that the RTB101 + everolimus combination therapy may also enhance the adaptive immune system, given that the RTB101 + everolimus combination resulted in broader TORC1 inhibition. 

14

We believe that the Phase 2a clinical trial results provide proof of concept for the potential therapeutic benefit of RTB101 as immunotherapy to reduce the incidence of RTIs in elderly patients, given the statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in RTI rates and the increased expression of innate anti-viral genes observed in RTB101 treatment groups. These Phase 2a results led to the selection of doses for our Phase 2b clinical trials where we confirmed the potential clinical benefits of RTB101 10 mg once daily for reducing the incidence of RTIs in the elderly at increased risk of RTI-associated morbidity and mortality.
 Phase 3 Clinical Development Plan 
 During the first quarter of 2019, we conducted an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. Alignment was reached with the FDA on key elements of the Phase 3 clinical trials that will support the submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for RTB101. Based on our communications with the FDA to date, we plan to conduct two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials during the winter cold and flu season to assess the safety and efficacy of 16 weeks of treatment with RTB101 10 mg once daily for the reduction, as compared to placebo, in the percentage of subjects with clinical symptoms consistent with an RTI. We expect to enroll elderly subjects, age 65 and older, excluding current smokers and COPD subjects, randomized 1:1 RTB101 to placebo. We expect the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 clinical trials to be a reduction, as compared to placebo, in the percentage of subjects with clinical symptoms consistent with a respiratory tract infection based on prespecified diagnostic criteria (defined as clinically symptomatic respiratory illness) with or without confirmation of a laboratory pathogen. We also expect a secondary endpoint to be the reduction in the percentage of subjects with clinically symptomatic respiratory illness associated with a laboratory-confirmed pathogen. Consistent with the Phase 2b endpoints, the Phase 3 endpoints include prespecified diagnostic criteria that encompass multiple types of RTIs.
 Each of the planned Phase 3 clinical trials is expected to be powered at greater than or equal to 90% to demonstrate a 30% reduction in the percentage of subjects with clinically symptomatic respiratory illness. The first Phase 3 clinical trial is planned to begin in the southern hemisphere in the second quarter of 2019 and is expected to enroll approximately 1,000 subjects. The second Phase 3 clinical trial is planned to begin in the northern hemisphere in the fourth quarter of 2019 and is expected to enroll approximately 1,600 subjects. The number of subjects randomized to receive RTB101 10 mg once daily in the Phase 2b and planned Phase 3 program is expected to reach at least 1,500 which, based on our communications with the FDA, is the safety database that we believe will be sufficient to support an NDA filing, barring any safety signals observed in the Phase 3 trials. Depending on enrollment in the planned Phase 3 clinical trials, we expect topline data from the Phase 3 clinical trials in 2020.
 In an analysis of our Phase 2b clinical trial results, a 46.6% reduction in the percentage of subjects with clinically symptomatic respiratory illness was observed in subjects age 65 and older who did not have COPD or smoke, the proposed Phase 3 patient population, when treated with RTB101 10mg once daily as compared to placebo (p=0.007). 
 The odds of experiencing clinically symptomatic respiratory illness in all cohorts compared to placebo are depicted in the figure below. The active incidence and placebo incidence refer to the number of subjects in the respective cohorts with clinically symptomatic respiratory illness, divided by the number of subjects in each cohort.

Safety Data from Clinical and Preclinical Development at High Doses of RTB101 Alone and in Combination with Everolimus 
 Originally, RTB101 was developed for oncology indications. In preclinical studies, at doses higher than those we are currently developing, RTB101 was found to prevent cellular proliferation and tumor progression. Clinical trials in humans were conducted under two open INDs for RTB101 filed with the FDA Division of Oncology Products. More than 440 oncology patients have been treated with RTB101 alone in doses up to 1,600 mg per day, or in combination with other drugs including 200 mg of RTB101 in combination with 2.5 mg of everolimus per day. RTB101 has also been administered to more than 60 healthy volunteers in pharmacokinetic, or PK, studies at doses of up to 1,000 mg per day. To date, the majority of the reported AEs were mild or moderate and include gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue, decreased appetite, rash and thrombocytopenia, which are consistent with those that have been reported for marketed mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred at doses less than 800 mg per day, and the maximum tolerated dose for RTB101 as a monotherapy was established at 1,200 mg per day. For the prevention of clinically symptomatic respiratory illness, we are developing RTB101 at a daily dose of 10 mg, 120 times lower than the established maximum tolerated dose, and therefore expect the RTB101 to have an acceptable tolerability profile for decreasing the incidence of clinically symptomatic respiratory illness.
 Standard preclinical safety and good laboratory practice, or GLP, toxicology studies, up to six months in rats and dogs, have been completed for RTB101, which we believe support the clinical development of the program.
 Other Potential Indications for Our TORC1 Program 
 We may evaluate RTB101 alone or in combination with a rapalog, such as everolimus or sirolimus, or other drugs for the treatment of additional indications, such as Parkinson’s disease, urinary tract infections, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We plan to initiate a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in the first quarter of 2019 for Parkinson’s disease. We expect to select indications based on strong scientific rationale, preclinical or clinical data, unmet medical need and other relevant considerations.
 Parkinson’s disease
 Parkinson’s disease, or PD, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects approximately 7.5 million people worldwide. The incidence of PD increases rapidly in people 60 years of age and older, with a mean age at diagnosis of 70.5 years. Glucocerebrosidase, or GBA1, gene mutations are the most common of the currently known PD genetic mutations and up to 10 percent of people with PD in the United States carry it. Patients with PD develop shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty walking. Similar to Huntington’s disease, PD may be attributed in part to neuronal damage caused by the accumulation within neurons of abnormal aggregates containing the protein α-synuclein. Preclinical studies in mouse models of PD have shown that mTOR inhibition can induce autophagy, reduce α-synuclein accumulation and decrease neuronal cell death. Therefore, induction of autophagy with RTB101 in combination with a rapalog may have therapeutic benefit for patients with PD.
 Prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections 
 Urinary tract infections, or UTIs, are the most common bacterial infection in the elderly, especially in women. Recurrent UTIs are typically defined as 3 or more UTIs within 12 months, or two or more occurrences within six months. Nearly 10% of women age 65 and older and nearly 30% of women age 85 and over report having a UTI annually, and more than half of women older than 55 have been observed to have a UTI recurrence within one year in a primary care setting. Healthcare resource utilization costs due to UTIs are significant, with elderly women having the highest growth in incidence of hospitalizations for UTIs (23.1% per year for women age 80-89). In 2011, UTI-related hospitalizations in the U.S. resulted in a total of $2.8 billion in healthcare costs. UTIs are also the most common reason for antibiotic prescriptions in older adults. Currently, continuous daily low-dose antibiotic prophylactic regimens are used to prevent recurrence of symptomatic UTIs and contribute to the development of multidrug resistant bacteria.
 Treatment of viral respiratory tract infections 
 In the Phase 2a clinical trial, an increase in the expression of innate antiviral gene pathways was observed in the RTB101 10 mg monotherapy and RTB101 10 mg + everolimus 0.1 mg combination arms. We may conduct a biomarker study to assess the speed at which antiviral genes are upregulated after elderly subjects are treated with RTB101. If we observe a rapid increase of antiviral gene expression, we believe RTB101 may have therapeutic benefit for the treatment of viral RTIs.
 16

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction 
 Heart failure is one of the most common causes of hospitalizations in people age 65 and older. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, affects about 2.25 million people in the United States, and almost 4 million in Europe and Japan. HFpEF predominantly affects elderly subjects, particularly older women, in whom 90% of new heart failure cases are HFpEF. Patients with HFpEF experience the clinical symptoms of heart failure, despite having the percentage of total blood in the left ventricle of the heart that is pushed out with each heartbeat, known as ejection fractions, in the normal range. These symptoms are attributable in part to stiffened heart muscle that limits blood flow into the heart, known as diastolic dysfunction. Outcomes following hospitalization for decompensated HFpEF are poor. Approximately one third of patients are rehospitalized or die within 90 days of discharge. To date, there are no FDA approved therapies to reduce hospitalization or mortality for HFpEF.
 According to scientific literature published by research groups at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and the University of Washington, aging mice develop stiffened heart muscle and diastolic dysfunction similar to elderly humans with HFpEF. Preclinical studies have shown that a 10-week course of mTOR inhibitor therapy reverses diastolic dysfunction in aging mice. This beneficial effect is likely partly due to an increase in proteins involved in mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acids are the predominant substrate used in mitochondrial energy production in healthy adults, but are replaced by glucose as the preferred substrate in heart failure. The shift to glucose as a substrate results in less ATP production by mitochondria. Since ATP is the main cellular fuel, a decrease in ATP production may contribute to heart failure. mTOR inhibitors shift mitochondria back to using fatty acids as a substrate and as a result may increase ATP production in the heart and improve heart function. These findings suggest that RTB101 alone or in combination with a rapalog, such as everolimus or sirolimus, may have potential therapeutic benefit for the treatment of HFpEF in humans.
 Huntington’s disease 
 Huntington’s disease, or HD, is a disease that affects neurons in the brain and causes movement, psychiatric and cognitive impairment. HD is caused by mutations in a gene encoding protein called huntingtin. Mutant huntingtin forms aggregate in neurons and cause the neurons to degenerate. The mutant huntingtin aggregates can be cleared from neurons by a process called autophagy in which cells remove and recycle intracellular debris including protein aggregates. Preclinical data from brain slices in a HD mouse model has shown that RTB101 in combination with a rapalog, such as everolimus or sirolimus, synergize to prevent neurodegeneration, likely by inducing autophagy and clearing mutant huntingtin aggregates. We believe these findings support the potential that RTB101 in combination with a rapalog, such as everolimus or sirolimus, could have therapeutic benefit for the treatment of HD.
 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a fatal, age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of both upper and lower motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. ALS is the most common motor neuron disorder and is estimated to affect 12,000-30,000 people in the United States. The median age of onset of ALS is 64 years, and is characterized by diseased muscle atrophy, spasticity and quadriplegia, culminating in death within three to five years of disease onset due to respiratory failure. Genetic studies of ALS patients have identified mutations in autophagy pathway genes including p62/SQSTM1, OPTN, TBK1, VCP, and C9ORF72. Further, enhancing autophagy has shown benefit in multiple preclinical models of ALS, hence we believe that induction of autophagy with RTB101 in combination with a rapalog, such as everolimus or sirolimus, may have potential therapeutic benefit for patients with ALS.
Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, including RTB101, their methods of use, related technology, and other inventions that are important to our business. We licensed a patent portfolio of ten patent families from Novartis. See “—License Agreement with Novartis.” As of March 15, 2019, one family within this patent portfolio covering compositions of matter has 46 issuances in 34 jurisdictions; and has nine pending applications in seven jurisdictions. Our issued patents and pending applications with respect to RTB101 are expected to expire in 2031 or 2032, (depending on eligibility for patent term extension or supplementary protection). Additional pending applications are expected to expire between 2034 and 2037, exclusive of possible patent term adjustments or extensions.
 In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology, know-how and other aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 17

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions, and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce the patents we own or control, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold or control may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 License Agreement with Novartis 
 In March 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis, pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive, field-restricted, worldwide license to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Novartis, including patents, patent applications, proprietary information, know-how and other intellectual property, to develop, commercialize and sell one or more therapeutic products comprising RTB101 alone or RTB101 and everolimus in a fixed dose combination. Under the license agreement, we have been licensed a patent portfolio of ten patent families directed to composition of matter of RTB101 and its salts, formulations of everolimus and methods of using RTB101 and everolimus to enhance the immune response among others. These families include certain granted patents and pending patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Russia, Japan, Korea and China. Patents in these families will begin expiring in 2026, subject to possible patent term extensions. We believe that patent term extension and the potential grant of certain pending patent applications may provide exclusivity for RTB101 and RTB101 + everolimus combination until 2037 in the United States and the major European markets.
 The exclusive field for RTB101 is for the treatment, prevention and diagnosis of diseases and other conditions in all indications in humans and animals. With respect to the fixed dose combination of RTB101 and everolimus, the exclusive field of use is for any indication in humans related to the improvement in immune function or immunosenescence in the elderly, the reduction of infection frequency, severity, duration, health care resource utilization, hospitalization, morbidity or mortality, or the treatment of infections, the reduction of pulmonary disease exacerbation frequency, severity, or related hospitalization, the enhancement of therapeutic or prophylactic benefits of vaccines, or any aging-related disease, excluding in each case the application of everolimus in connection with organ transplantation, oncology, immune-oncology or in the cardiac stent field. Novartis has agreed not to enforce any rights to improvements related to RTB101 developed after the effective date in connection with the exercise of our rights under this agreement. In addition, we have agreed to grant back to Novartis for use outside of the exclusive fields any improvements related to everolimus that we develop after the effective date.
 We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product in the field in at least one major market, which includes the United States, Japan and certain identified countries in Europe.
 As initial consideration for the license, we issued NIBR 2,587,992 shares of our Series A preferred stock.
 As additional consideration for the license, we are required to pay up to an aggregate of $4.3 million upon the satisfaction of clinical milestones, up to an aggregate of $24 million upon the satisfaction of regulatory milestones for the first indication approved, and up to an aggregate of $18 million upon the satisfaction of regulatory milestones for the second indication approved. In addition, we are required to pay up to an aggregate of $125 million upon the satisfaction of commercial milestones, based on the amount of annual net sales. We are also required to pay tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single digit percentage to a low-teen digit percentage on annual net sales of products. These royalty obligations last on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of a Novartis patent covering a subject product, (ii) the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity for the subject product in a country, or (iii) the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in the country, and are subject to a reduction after the expiration of the last valid claim of a Novartis patent or the introduction of a generic equivalent of a product in a country. In addition, if we sublicense the rights under the license agreement, we are required to pay a certain percentage of the sublicense revenue to Novartis. Following the last visit of the 400th subject in our Phase 2b clinical trial, Novartis is no longer entitled to sublicense revenue.
 Either we or Novartis may terminate the license agreement if the other party commits a material breach and fails to cure such breach within 60 days after written notice. Novartis may terminate the license agreement upon our bankruptcy, 
 18

insolvency, dissolution or winding up. In addition, Novartis may partially terminate the license agreement with respect to everolimus if we fail or cease to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and commercialize a product utilizing everolimus for a period of three years, provided that our license related to RTB101 and Novartis’s license to our improvements related to everolimus will continue. In addition, we may terminate the license agreement, with or without cause, in its entirety or on a product-by-product or country-by-country basis, upon 60 days’ prior written notice.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We hold worldwide commercialization rights to our product candidates. We do not have our own marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize our product candidate if approved for commercial sale, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third parties that have sales and marketing experience. We plan to directly commercialize our product candidates in the United States with a focused sales force targeting top-prescribing physicians with high flow of elderly patients. For some indications, we may also directly commercialize our product candidates in the European Union. In other markets or for certain indications outside the United States for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates.
Manufacturing 
 RTB101 and rapalogs, such as everolimus or sirolimus, are small molecules that can be manufactured using commercially available technologies. We acquired data from Novartis related to the chemical synthesis and manufacturing of RTB101, which is currently being manufactured by a single contract manufacturing organization, and are outsourcing the manufacturing of rapalogs, such as everolimus or sirolimus.
 We believe there are multiple sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates. Our manufacturing strategy enables us to more efficiently direct financial resources to the research, development, and commercialization of product candidates rather than diverting resources to internally develop manufacturing facilities. As our product candidates advance through development, we expect to enter into longer-term commercial supply agreements with key suppliers and manufacturers to fulfill and secure the ongoing and planned preclinical, clinical, and, if our product candidates are approved for marketing, our commercial supply needs for ourselves and our collaborators. Our long-term strategy is to secure at least two sources for the manufacturing of our products.
 Manufacturing of any product candidate is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. We expect that all of our contract manufacturing organizations will manufacture RTB101 under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals to be used in humans.
 Competition 
 We consider Navitor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Navitor, to be our most direct competitor in developing novel therapeutics targeting TORC1 for aging-related diseases. However, Navitor’s clinical TORC1 candidate is a TORC1 activator that is in Phase 1 clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression. We are aware of multiple other allosteric and catalytic mTOR inhibitors in development by other companies. We are not aware of any TORC1 inhibitors with TORC1 selectivity comparable to our product candidate, RTB101, being commercially developed.
 We are also aware of other companies seeking to develop treatments to prevent or treat aging-related diseases through biological pathways unrelated to mTOR inhibition, including Calico Life Sciences LLC, or Calico, and UNITY Biotechnology, Inc., or Unity. Calico has not yet disclosed any pipeline candidates, and Unity’s most advanced candidate, based on publicly disclosed information, is in Phase 1 clinical trials for osteoarthritis. Hence, we believe that we currently have the most clinically advanced program based on the stage of development of our competitors’ programs.
 We are aware of other companies that are potential competitors for prevention or treatment of respiratory tract infections. Companies pursuing broad-spectrum prophylactic and therapeutic treatments in respiratory tract infections include PrEP BioPharm, Inc. and Ena Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly Innavac). Based on publicly disclosed information, we believe that we have the most clinically advanced program, and the only program based on TORC1 selectivity. Narrow-spectrum prophylactic treatments are also being developed by potential competitors. Several of these treatments target the respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, one of the top known causes of RTIs in older adults. However, as RTIs in the elderly are largely caused by many different viruses, we believe that our approach may be more broadly applicable in addressing RTIs.
 19

Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that we may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors may include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive regulatory approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, dosing convenience, price, formulary coverage and reimbursement. Our existing or potential future competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. Our current and potential future competitors may also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors.
 Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a more effective treatment method for prevention of respiratory tract infections by a competitor could render our product candidate non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our product candidate before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses.
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs primarily under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. In addition, an applicant may need to recall a product.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
  
• | completion of nonclinical, or preclinical, laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated at that site;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, and payment of user fees;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20

 
• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Before an applicant begins testing a compound in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 The IND and IRB Processes 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of the investigational drug. In an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold.
 Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor who wishes to rely upon it in support of its NDA must ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. FDA must also be able to validate the data from the study through an on-site inspection if necessary.
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review of the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA 
 21

regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial regulatory approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the applicant must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate 
 22

packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Review of an NDA by the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.5 million in fiscal year 2019 for applications requiring clinical data, and an annual prescription drug program fee exceeding $309,000 in fiscal year 2019. These fees are typically increased annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt, before accepting the NDA for filing, to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Applications for drugs containing novel active moieties are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and applications for “priority review” products containing novel active moieties are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Priority Review 
 The FDA has a number of programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. Three of these programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review designation.
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary 
 23

evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, could result in the FDA’s withdrawal of the approval and require the withdrawal of the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

The FDA’s Decision on an NDA 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and select clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety or effectiveness after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs.
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, many changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are annual program fee requirements for certain marketed products.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the NDA holder and any third-party manufacturers that the NDA holder may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 25

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs generally may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Hatch-Waxman Amendments 
 Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product, known as a reference listed drug, or RLD. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients to the site of drug action in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
 Non-Patent Exclusivity 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until any applicable period of non-patent data exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity, or NCE. For the purposes of this provision, an NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, which states the proposed generic drug will not infringe one or more of the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity for non-NCE drugs if the NDA or a supplement to the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application or supplement. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication, but it generally would not protect the original, unmodified product from generic competition. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic or versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product; it only prevents FDA from approving such ANDAs.

Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
 In seeking approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Upon submission of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents for the RLD required to be listed in the Orange Book that:
  
• | no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | such patent has expired;
--+-------------------------


• | the date on which such patent expires; or
--+------------------------------------------


• | such patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is not seeking approval of a use covered by the patent or the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If an applicant indicates that it is not seeking approval of a method of use
 covered by a patent, that method of use will not delay approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2). If the applicant otherwise does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a paragraph IV certification the applicant must send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification within 45 days of receiving the notice, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation. If the drug has NCE exclusivity and the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is submitted four years after approval, the 30-month stay is extended so that it expires 7 1⁄2 years after approval of the innovator drug, unless the patent expires or there is a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant before then.
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended, an NDA or supplement thereto for a drug with certain innovative features (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form) must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 27

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of certain existing non-patent exclusivity periods, including orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data within certain time periods. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application after expiration of a patent.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the drug for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives regulatory approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent term restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question and within 60 days of drug approval. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
 Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union.
 28

Clinical Trial Approval
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. The Regulation is anticipated to apply in 2019. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 Marketing Authorization
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of HIV or AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation and whose authorization would be in the interest of public health at EU level, the centralized procedure is optional.
 Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is 
 29

possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 67 days from the date of the CHMP Opinion, the European Commission will adopt its final decision on the marketing authorization application.
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.
 The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.
 Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union
 In the European Union, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the European Union market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals
 A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the European Union market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
 Regulatory Requirements after a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
 In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the European Union is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include:
  
• | Compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 30

 
• | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable European Union laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with European Union cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union notably under Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, and EU Member State laws.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.
 Healthcare Law and Regulation
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted regulatory approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; in addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 31

 
• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | European Privacy Laws including the General Data Protection Regulation and the E-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC), and the national laws implementing or supplementing each of them.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, all affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
 GDPR and EU Privacy Law Reform
 In the EU, Regulation 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, replaced the EU Data Protection Directive on May 25, 2018. The GDPR introduced new data protection requirements in the European Union, as well as potential fines for noncompliance of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue. The regulation imposes numerous new requirements for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, including: more stringent requirements relating to data subject consent; what information must be shared with data subjects regarding how their personal information is used; the obligation to notify regulators and affected individuals of personal data breaches; extensive new internal privacy governance obligations; and obligations to honor expanded rights of individuals in relation to their personal information (e.g., the right to access, correct and delete their data). In addition, the GDPR maintains the EU Data Protection Directive’s restrictions on cross border data transfer. The GDPR increases the responsibility and liability of pharmaceutical companies in relation to processing personal data, and companies may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules. Further, Brexit has created uncertainty with regard to the status of the United Kingdom as an ‘adequate country’ for the purposes of data transfers outside the European Economic Area. In particular, it is unclear how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated. These changes may require us to find alternative bases for the compliant transfer of personal data from the United Kingdom to the United States and we are monitoring developments in this area.
 Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Healthcare Reform
 32

In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our potential product candidates are:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 33

 
coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Affordable Care Act. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. Further, on June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in Affordable Care Act risk corridor payments to third-party payors argued. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the Affordable Care Act marketplace, providers, and our business, are not yet known. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the Affordable Care Act for plans sold through such marketplaces. Lastly, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While such U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump Administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, then-President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
