Item 1. Business 
 We are a fabless semiconductor company that designs, markets and sells mixed-signal integrated circuits for multiple video applications in the security surveillance and automotive markets. Our integrated circuits are enabling the transition from standard definition, or SD, video to high definition, or HD, video in the security surveillance and automotive industries. We target specific video applications that receive and process high definition analog video signals, including surveillance cameras, surveillance digital video recorders, or DVRs, as well as cameras in automobiles. We design application specific products that utilize our HD analog transmission technology and perform advanced digital video processing to facilitate the display, transmission and storage of video content. We 
 1

believe designing our integrated circuits for specific applications allows us to better address varying end-customer requirements, fully leverage our technological capabilities and achieve greater share within our target markets.
 We were originally incorporated in California in April 2012, and we reincorporated into Delaware in July 2017. During September 2017, we completed our initial public offering of Japanese Depositary Shares, or JDSs. We have decided to issue to the public, and list on the Mothers market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, JDSs, instead of our common stock. JDSs are a representative security, and each JDS will represent one share of common stock.
 Application Specific Products 
 We design, market and sell integrated circuits that enable the transmission of high definition video content over long cable distances to facilitate the display, storage or processing of video content. Our application specific products currently include our security surveillance and automotive product lines. We intend to continue to develop new generations of products for each of these application specific product lines. 
 Security Surveillance. We have three subgroups of products for security surveillance consisting of HD-TVI transmitters, HD-TVI receivers and HD-SDI receivers. 
 HD-TVI Transmitters. Our HD-TVI transmitters are used within the camera, and take the HD digital signal from an HD camera processor and converts it to HD-TVI analog signals. We integrate the HD camera processor and HD-TVI transmitter into the same integrated circuit to save cost and save space in a camera. We also market standalone HD-TVI transmitters to increase our flexibility to work with other camera processors in the market. This allows a customer either to purchase our combined HD-TVI transmitter with both a processor and transmitter or our standalone transmitter to be paired with a third-party processor. 
 HD-TVI Receivers. Our HD-TVI receivers are used in DVRs, and convert the HD-TVI analog signal into digital signals to be processed by a DVR system, which can then transmit the image to a display. To improve the cost and performance of our HD-TVI receivers, we integrate multiple HD-TVI receivers along with standard definition analog video decoders as well as analog audio decoders into the same integrated circuit. This allows HD DVR makers to support HD video and standard definition video for backward compatibility at the same time. 
 HD-SDI Receivers. Our HD-SDI receivers perform similar functions for HD video as our HD-TVI receivers, except these HD-SDI receivers use serial digital transmission technology used in video broadcasting instead of our HD-TVI technology. Having both HD-TVI and HD-SDI receiver products in our product portfolio allows us to address both the analog and digital HD security surveillance market segments at the same time. 
 Automotive. We optimize our automotive HD-TVI transmitters and receivers to work with current automotive camera processors and navigation systems in the automotive market. 
 Automotive HD-TVI Transmitters: Our automotive HD-TVI transmitters are designed to work specifically with current automotive camera processors and image sensors. 
 Automotive HD-TVI Camera Processors: We also provide automotive camera processors that integrates our HD-TVI transmitters to provide higher integration for better cost and smaller camera module size.
 Automotive HD-TVI Receivers: Similar to our security surveillance products, our automotive HD-TVI receiver also integrates standard definition analog video decoders so that automotive vendors have the flexibility of supporting both HD and standard definition video. We also integrate multiple HD-TVI receivers for multiple camera applications inside the car. 
 Automotive LCD Controllers:  We provide HD LCD controllers that allows us to support LCD panels for the HD E-mirror as well as for various HD LCD panel displays inside the car.

Technology 
 We have several core competencies that enable us to design analog, mixed signal and digital technologies that can be implemented across our application specific product lines. We have internally developed the combination of technologies, expertise and capabilities necessary for the conversion and processing of HD video signals. We do not depend on third parties for any material technology, expertise or design capability. 
 We have developed a proprietary high definition analog video transmission technology called high definition transport video interface, or HD-TVI. Our HD analog technology operates at the same 1080p HD resolution as digital HD technologies, but transmits the information in a continuous format, or wave, instead of a binary 0 or 1 format. When transmitted information in an analog system encounters interference or other degradation, the video quality is impacted, this is in contrast to a digital transmission where once a threshold level of interference or other degradation is encountered the image is cutoff completely. Our HD-TVI technology uses analog transmission 
 3

techniques that are an extension of legacy analog video broadcasting technology used in traditional analog televisions but which can deliver high definition video transmission over long cable distances. Our HD-TVI transmitter interfaces with a high definition camera processor or image sensor and converts the digital HD content to an HD analog signal. After transmission, our HD-TVI receiver converts this analog signal back into a digital signal for processing by a standard display processor. 
 As a result of our advanced analog design capability, we have developed multiple technologies that enable analog video signals to be processed digitally. One of the key analog technologies we have developed internally is our high performance and cost effective analog front-end that conditions and converts analog video signals into a digital format for display. The multiple core functions performed within our integrated circuits featuring an analog front-end are anti-aliasing filtering, automatic gain control signal clamping and analog to digital conversion. Other key analog technologies we have developed internally are analog equalizers, phase lock loops, high frequency and delta sigma analog to digital converters, video and audio digital to analog converters and low voltage differential signaling. 
 We have also developed a number of digital technologies specific to the security surveillance and automotive markets. For example, we have developed image signal processing technologies such as wide dynamic range, noise reduction, as well as de-interlacing, scaling, and other video enhancement algorithms, which are important technologies for HD cameras and HD video display technologies for security surveillance and automotive HD video applications. We also possess digital HD transmission technologies such as serializer and de-serializer interface technologies, which we can offer as an alternative to our HD analog transmission technologies. 
 Customers 
 We principally sell our products to distributors who, in turn, sell to original design manufacturers, or ODMs, contract manufacturers and design houses. In addition, we sell our products, though to a lesser extent, directly to ODMs. ODMs typically design and manufacture electronic products to sell to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. Our agreements to sell our products through distribution channels generally provide for a non-exclusive right to sell, promote and develop a market for our products in a specified geographic area. These agreements generally may be terminated by either party on 60 days’ notice and do not require price protection.
 In both the security surveillance and automotive markets, we have significant engagement with our end-customers prior to completion of a sale. In the security surveillance market, our end-customer is the OEM or system designer who manufacturers or designs the end product, such as a camera or DVR, that will be purchased for placement into a security surveillance system. In the automotive market, our end-customer is the automobile manufacturer, but we also typically engage with system designers and manufacturers who sell systems, such as navigation or backup video camera systems, to automobile manufacturers. Our sales representatives and engineers engage directly with these end-customers, even if we do not sell directly to them, because these end-customers exert significant influence over the design of the products or systems that are ultimately placed into their products. Our integrated circuits are used by security surveillance manufacturers, such as Hikvision in China, IDIS in South Korea and AVTech in Taiwan. These three manufacturers are each a leading security surveillance manufacturer in their respective country. We also currently have design wins for future generations of automobiles with major automotive equipment manufacturers. A design win does not necessarily result in future revenue, but we believe it is a strong indicator that our integrated circuits will be incorporated into a future model for that particular automotive equipment manufacturer. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our products worldwide through multiple channels, primarily through our network of domestic and international independent distributors and sales representatives. Each of these sales channels is supported by our customer service and marketing organizations. We have sales and customer support personnel in the United States, China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. We intend to expand our sales and support capabilities and our network of independent sales representatives in key regions worldwide. 
 Our sales cycles typically range from three to six months for the security surveillance market and one to three years for the automotive industry. We work directly with system designers to create demand for our products by 
 4

providing them with application specific product information for their system design, engineering and procurement groups. We actively engage these groups during their design processes to introduce them to our integrated circuits. We endeavor to design our products to meet anticipated, increasingly complex and specific design requirements, but which will also support widespread demand for the products and future enhancements to them. If successful, this process culminates in a system designer deciding to use our products in their system, which we refer to as a design win. Once our product is accepted and designed into an application, we believe the system designer is likely to continue to use the same or enhanced versions of our product across a number of their models, which tends to extend the life cycle of our product. This is particularly true in the automotive industry, which typically experiences multi-year product lifecycles, sometimes up to four years or longer. In addition, a design win into a particular model of car for a specific manufacturer may translate into design wins for different models from the same auto manufacturer. If we fail to achieve an initial design win, we may lose the opportunity for sales to an end-customer for a number of its products and for a lengthy period of time. 
 Backlog 
 Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers that have not yet shipped. Historically, management has not used backlog as an indicator of future business. As our order lead times may vary and as industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice, we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of future sales. In addition, our quarterly revenue depends on orders booked and shipped in that quarter. As a result, we have not experienced material backlog at the end of a quarter, and any backlog at that time would be more indicative of the timing of the order, rather than anything that may predict future performance. 
Research and Development 
 Our research and development efforts are focused on the development of new technologies as well as application specific products. Our engineering team has expertise in advanced analog design, mixed signal digital processing, video decoding and software engineering. Our research and development expense was $7.3 million, $5.4 million, and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
Intellectual Property 
 We seek to protect our proprietary technology, documentation and other written materials primarily under trade secret and copyright laws. We also typically require employees with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements. The steps taken by us to protect our proprietary information may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology. 
 Although we rely primarily on trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect the technology in the integrated circuits we currently design and market, our success and ability to compete in the future may also depend to a significant degree upon obtaining and enforcing patent protection for our HD analog and other mixed signal technologies. As of December 31, 2018, we have two patent applications pending in the United States. These patent applications cover aspects of the technology in the integrated circuits we currently design and market. Our future patents, if any are issued, may provide only limited protection for our technology and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages to us. For example, competitors could be successful in challenging any issued patents or, alternatively, could develop similar or more advantageous technologies on their own or design around our patents. 
 The laws of various countries in which we market our integrated circuits may offer little or no protection for our proprietary technologies. Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us for doing so. Any inability to protect our proprietary rights could harm our ability to compete, generate revenue and grow our business. 
 We may be required to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. We may also be subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to our intellectual property in the ordinary course of our business. Intellectual 
 5

property litigation is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management’s attention away from running our business. This litigation could also require us to pay substantial damages to the party claiming infringement, stop selling products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property, develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license arrangements. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication, packaging or testing facility. We depend on third-party vendors to manufacture, package and test our products. By outsourcing manufacturing, we are able to avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility. This allows us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products. 
 Integrated Circuit Fabrication. We currently outsource the manufacturing of our integrated circuits to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, and Fujitsu Electronics America, Inc., or Fujitsu. We work closely with TSMC and Fujitsu to forecast on a monthly basis our manufacturing capacity requirements. Our integrated circuits are currently fabricated in several advanced manufacturing processes. Because smaller geometry process technologies lead to enhanced performance, smaller silicon chip size and lower power requirements, we continually evaluate the benefits and feasibility of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to reduce cost and improve performance. We believe that our fabless manufacturing approach provides us with the benefits of superior manufacturing capability as well as flexibility to move the manufacturing, assembly and testing of our products to those vendors that offer the best capability, with adequate capacity at an attractive price. Nevertheless, because we do not have a formal, long-term pricing agreement with TSMC or Fujitsu, our wafer costs and services are subject to sudden price fluctuations based on the cyclical demand for semiconductors. Our engineers work closely with TSMC and Fujitsu to increase yields, lower manufacturing costs and improve quality. We intend to qualify and retain additional foundries to manufacture our semiconductors in the future. 
 Assembly and Test. Our products are shipped from TSMC or Fujitsu to third-party sort, assembly and test facilities where they are assembled into finished integrated circuits and tested. We outsource all packaging and testing of our products to assembly and test subcontractors, principally Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., or ASE, and Sigurd Microelectronics Corporation, or Sigurd. Our products are designed to use low cost, standard packages and to be tested with widely available test equipment. 
 Quality Assurance. We are committed to maintaining the highest level of quality in our products. We have designed and implemented a quality management system that provides the framework for continual improvement of products, processes and customer service. We also rely on in-depth simulation studies, testing and practical application testing to validate and verify our integrated circuits. To ensure consistent product quality, reliability and yield, together with our manufacturing logistics partners, we closely monitor the production cycle by reviewing manufacturing process data from each wafer foundry and assembly subcontractor. We are certified for ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. 
Competition 
 The market in which we operate is extremely competitive, and is characterized by rapid technological change, continuously evolving end-customer requirements and declining average selling prices. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors. We compete with numerous domestic and international semiconductor manufacturers and designers. In our automotive market, we principally compete with Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and Texas Instruments Incorporated. In selling our integrated circuits into the surveillance market, we principally compete against Nextchip Co., Ltd in South Korea, Pixelplus Co., Ltd in South Korea, Dahua Technology Co. Ltd in China, and Fullhan Microelectronic Co., Ltd in China. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and name recognition and a larger base of customers than we do. They may also have a larger presence and more significant relationships within certain geographical areas, such as in Asia where many of our end-customers operate. This may allow them to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. Some of our competitors currently offer product features or technologies that we do not currently offer but intend to sell in the future, such as Ultra HD advanced camera image signal processors. We must, therefore, compete against competitors that have more experience in developing and selling products and technologies that we do not currently 
 6

offer but intend to offer in the future. Some of our competitors also use smaller geometry process technologies in their products, which can result in better manufacturing yields and decreased costs. In addition, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential end-customers. Increased competition could harm our business, by, for example, increasing pressure on our profit margins or causing us to lose end-customers. In addition, delivery of products with defects or reliability, quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and competitive position. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to deliver products without reliability, quality or compatibility problems and on a number of other factors such as performance and robustness, functionality, price and cost effectiveness, rapid time-to-market and customer service and support. 
 We believe we currently compete favorably with respect to these factors in the aggregate. However, we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering our market. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 73 employees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
Segment, Geographic Areas and Concentration Information 
 We operate under one reportable segment which is comprised of one operating segment. See Note 4 “Segment Information” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further segment and geographic information. For concentration information, see Note 1 “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Facilities 
 Our corporate headquarters and primary research and development and operations facilities occupy approximately 8,512 square feet in San Jose, California, under a lease that expires in February 2020. We also lease properties in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. We do not own any manufacturing facilities, and we contract and license to third parties the production and distribution of our semiconductors. We believe our space is adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available to accommodate foreseeable expansion of our operations.
