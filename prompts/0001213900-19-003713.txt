ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

 
Our Company develops optical touch and gesture solutions for human interaction with devices. We offer our core technology under the brand name “zForce”.
 
We license our technology to Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Tier 1 suppliers who embed our technology into products they develop, manufacture and sell. Our licensing customers have sold approximately 67 million devices that use our technology.
 
In addition to our licensing business, we design and manufacture sensor modules that incorporate our zForce AIR technology. We sell our embedded sensors components to OEMs, Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”) and Tier 1 suppliers for use in their products. We began shipping sensor modules in October 2017. We also sell our Neonode branded AirBar product that incorporates one of our sensor modules through distributors and directly to consumers.
 
Our Organization
 
Neonode Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 4, 1997. Our principal executive office is located in Stockholm, Sweden. Our office in the United States is located in San Jose, California.
 
In 2008, we established a wholly owned subsidiary Neonode Technologies AB (Sweden) to develop and license touchscreen technology. In 2013, we established a wholly owned subsidiaries: Neonode Japan Inc., (Japan); Neno User Interface Solutions AB (Sweden) (sold in December 2018); NEON Technology Inc. (U.S.) (dissolved November 19, 2018); and Neonode Americas Inc. (U.S.) (dissolved November 19, 2018). In 2014, we established an additional wholly owned subsidiary: Neonode Korea Ltd. (South Korea). In 2015, we established an additional wholly owned subsidiary: Neonode Taiwan Ltd (Taiwan). In 2015, we established a 51% majority owned consolidated subsidiary: Pronode Technologies AB (Sweden). In 2016, we entered into a joint venture, Neoeye AB (Sweden).
 
Strategy and Focus Areas
 
Our customers use touch, gesture and object sensing technology to grow their businesses, drive efficiencies, and seek competitive advantages. In this interactive world, cost effective and robust sensing technology is a strategic asset and is increasingly distributed across an expanding number of products. Our strategy is to deliver proven technology and support with the integration so our customers can bring products to market that provide an optimal user experience.
 
Our operations include a business unit to design, manufacture and sell embedded sensors to our business-to-business customers who integrate them into their products. We previously only offered licensed touch technology designs. An important piece of our strategy has been the development of an automated manufacturing and production system. Our ability to manufacture fully integrated sensor modules and provide support with hardware and software integration reduces our customers’ time to market while providing us a path to further growth. 
 
Our goal is to continue to be a leader in touch technology while transitioning current licensing customers into our embedded sensors and expanding to new markets where touch, gesture and object detecting features provide a competitive advantage. We intend to continue innovating through the introduction of next-generation products that offer better price and performance and architectural advantages compared to our competitors. We intend to execute on this strategy through portfolio transformation, internal innovation, and co-development of products with our customers and the building of strategic partnerships.

Business Model
 
We derive revenues through technology licensing, selling embedded sensor modules and engineering consulting services. We mainly operate in the business-to-business (“B2B”) markets.
 
Licensing 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we have entered into forty-one technology license agreements with global OEMs, ODMs and Tier 1 suppliers.
 
Our licensing customer base is primarily in the automotive, printer, specialized tablet and e-reader markets. Seventeen of our licensing customers are currently shipping products that embed our touch and gesture technology. We anticipate current and new customers will initiate product shipments throughout 2019 and in future years as they complete final product development and release cycles. Customer product development and release cycles typically take between 6 months to 36 months. We earn our license fees on a per unit basis when our customers ship products using our technology.


We also offer engineering consulting services to our licensing customers on a flat rate or hourly rate basis. Typically, our customers require engineering support during the development and initial manufacturing phase for their products using our technology.
  
Our plan is to continue with the licensing business along with selling embedded sensor modules. For some customers, the licensing business model is preferable to transitioning to purchase agreements using our sensor modules.
 
Sensor modules 
 
In 2015, we developed our zForce AIR. This optical sensing technology that enables touch interaction, gesture control and object detection led to the development of a series of sensor modules that provide our customers with various solutions in a sensor hardware component.
 
We utilize a robotic manufacturing process designed specifically for zForce AIR components. Industry specific sensor modules with a common technology platform provides hardware touch, gesture and object sensing solutions that, paired with our technology licensing platform, gives us a full range of options to enter and compete in key markets.
 
Our offerings include a consumer product, AirBar. As a plug and play accessory, AirBar enables touch and gesture functionality for notebook computers. AirBar is powered by our sensor modules. In 2016 and 2017, we began shipping 15.6 inch, 13.3 inch and 14 inch AirBar to distributors and customers in the United States and Europe. We have no current plans to develop new Neonode branded products for the consumer markets.
 
In October 2017, we began selling embedded sensor modules to business customers in the industrial and consumer electronics markets. Over time, we expect a significant portion of our revenues will be derived from sensor modules.
 
Markets
 
Automotive
 
Sensors are a key enabler to developing automobiles that become more interactive in every generation. Our sensor offering address challenges when automobiles interact with the driver, passengers, its environment and other vehicles. The need for new sensors is growing rapidly as new concepts develop into automobiles ready for mass production.

The automotive market is comprised of OEM and a series of Tier 1 suppliers who design and manufacture systems and components for the OEMs. We have license agreements with many of the major Tier 1 suppliers who deliver center console infotainment systems to the automotive OEMs. We are also in active design and product development co-operations for our sensor modules with the leading Tier 1 suppliers of automotive entry in addition to our interactive self and assisted driving steering wheel.
 
In 2016, fourteen automotive OEMs had a total of thirty-six automobile models using our touch technology in their infotainment systems. The majority of these automobiles are sold in China and include SUVs (Baojun 560 and Haval H6) and two top-selling sedans (Chevrolet Cruze and Buick Excelle). In the fourth quarter of 2014, Volvo launched their XC90 incorporating a 9.7 inch display using our touch technology. Our touch technology was also deployed in Volvo models launched in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the S90, V90, V90 Cross Country, XC60 and XC40. The Volvo XC90 and S90 infotainment systems have received awards citing properties such as responsiveness and gloved operation. During 2018, our customers shipped approximately 1.1 million products compared to approximately 1.1 million in 2017.
 
We are currently actively engaged with automotive OEM and Tier 1 suppliers to the automotive market in the development of the following:



● | Our zForce AIR sensor modules are being developed for use in entry systems such as tailgates, trunks and other exterior parts of the automobile to enable handsfree entry and automation of door functions. The Air sensors also support a wide array of touch and gesture input in the cars passenger compartment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our zForce DRIVE sensor technology enables high fidelity detection of hands and fingers positions on the steering wheel. This helps create a safer and more natural interaction with the automobile’s systems and the driver’s smart phone to decrease driver distraction. In 2015, we entered into an agreement with Autoliv Development AB, a leading supplier of safety products for the automotive industry, to explore and industrialize our zForce technology for the steering wheel. Self and assisted driving cars with zForce DRIVE sensors have been publicly displayed at CES 2016, 2017 and 2018. The technology was shown in the latest version of Veoneers LIV car at CES.

Consumer Electronics
 
Printers and Office Equipment
 
Multi-function printers typically require feature-rich menus and settings to deliver an optimal user experience and printer OEMs are increasingly replacing mechanical buttons and old style resistive touch displays with higher performance touch interactive displays. We have license agreements with five of the leading global printers and office equipment OEMs. World’s largest printer manufacturer started shipping the first consumer printer with our touch technology integrated in early 2014 and today many of their printer models with interactive displays are using our technology. Other major customers started shipping printers with our technology in late 2016 and in the first quarter 2017. During 2018 our customers shipped approximately 8 million printers and cumulatively they shipped approximately 32 million printers using our touch technology since mid-2014.
 
E-Readers and Tablets
 
Our touch technology is widely used in e-readers. Since 2011, over 31 million e-readers and tablets have been shipped containing our touch technology. During 2018, our customers shipped more than 2.0 million e-readers and tablets.
 
Product Backlog
 
Our sensor module product backlog at March 1, 2019 was approximately $22,000. The product backlog includes orders confirmed for products planned to be shipped within 60 days to one customer. Our AirBar backlog at March 1, 2019 was approximately $131,000. The product backlog includes orders confirmed for products planned to be shipped within 60 days to three customers. Our cycle time between order and shipment is generally short and customers occasionally change delivery schedules. Additionally, orders can be canceled without significant penalties. As a result of these factors, we do not believe that our product backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual product revenue for any future period.

Distribution, Sales and Marketing
 
Licensing
 
In our licensing business, we consider OEMs, ODMs and Tier 1 suppliers to be our primary customers. OEMs, ODMs and Tier 1 suppliers determine the design requirements and make the overall decision regarding the use of our user interface and touch technology in their products. The use and pricing of our user interface and touch technology are governed by a technology licensing agreement, which typically have an initial term of three years with automatic one-year renewal periods.
 
Our licensing agreements historically resulted from sales efforts by our senior management, design engineers, and sales personnel interacting with our potential customers’ decision-makers throughout the product development and order process.
 
Sensor modules
 
In our sensor module business, we consider OEMs, ODMs and Tier 1 suppliers to be our primary customers. Our customers purchase sensor modules that come in different sizes with different interfaces and we offer engineering consulting to customize hardware and/or firmware to meet specific requirements. We produce the sensor modules in Sweden by our majority-owned subsidiary Pronode, in an automated manufacturing process. The sales of our sensors are governed by a product purchase agreement. In addition, our customers may request engineering services which will generate NRE fee revenues.
 
Our sales force and marketing operations are managed out of our office in Stockholm, Sweden. Our current sales force is comprised of sales offices located in the United States, Sweden, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.
 
Our sales are normally negotiated and executed in U.S. Dollars.

Touch Technologies
 
Background
 
There are various technologies for touch and gesture sensing technology available in the market with differing profiles such as performance, power consumption, level of maturity, and cost:

● | Optical sensing technology uses structured light beams that when blocked or reflected by objects enables the detection of the objects position. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Capacitive touch sensors typically use one or several layers of transparent conductive material applied to the inner structure of the LCD or on a glass or plastic layer in front on the LCD to sense activation. 
● | Resistive touch sensors use conductive and resistive layers separated by thin space to sense activation. 
● | Acoustic pulse recognition sensors use piezoelectric transducers located at positions of a surface to alter the mechanical energy of a touch vibration into an electronic signal. 
● | Surface acoustic wave touch sensors use ultrasonic waves that pass over the screen for activation. 

Capacitive and Resistive Technology
 
The two dominant types of touch technologies available are capacitive and resistive. A capacitive sensor reacts to a conductive object by sensing the difference in capacitance between two areas on the sensor surface or between the finger and the ground. Capacitive touch sensors are suitable if the user has unimpeded contact between the finger and the screen. A resistive touch sensor is pressure-sensitive. Resistive touch sensors are suitable for detailed work and for selection of particular spot on a screen. Resistive technology is not suitable for sweeping gestures or motion, such as zooming in and out.
Optical Sensing Technology
 
Our optical technology works by projecting Infrared beams across a surface, through the air or any other detection area without any need for an extra physical layer to be added. It can be activated by using any object such as fingers, passive pens or thick gloves. Our optical sensing technology can also be designed to work through transparent materials, enabling 100% water/dust proof applications and can provide sensing functionality when fully submerged.
 
We believe our optical sensing technology has a number of key advantages over other touch sensing technologies:
 

● | It does not require additional layers that may dilute the image quality of the display or cause unwanted reflections and glare making reading the display difficult. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | It is faster than capacitive sensing technology. 
● | It requires no downward pressure on the activation surface in order to select or move items. 
● | It is cost-efficient due to the lower cost of materials and its high yield manufacturing process. 
● | It enables multiple methods of input, such as continuous tracking of multiple fingers, taps to hit keys, sweeps to zoom in or out, and gestures to write text or symbols directly on the touch surface. 
● | It works in all environments and does not require any special properties from the object used. 

Competition
 
The market for touch technology is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving standards and new product releases by our competitors.
 
We believe that implementation of resistive touch technologies in consumer devices is declining because of limitations in sweep gestures, limitations on industrial design, and the negative impact on screen clarity due to film overlays.
 
Neonode is one of few companies that offer optical sensing technology in high volume. Our major competition are companies offering projected capacitive (“PCAP”) technologies. PCAP is a prevalent standard in mobiles and tablets offering finger-based touch and industrial design flexibility. PCAP has many suppliers competing to offer the same solution with price being a major differentiation point. OEMs regularly change PCAP suppliers in order to maintain the best pricing.
