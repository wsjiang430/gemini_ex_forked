ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company History
 
Regnum Corp. was organized on March 31, 2016 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We were formed for a primary business purpose of servicing the increasing demand for premium entertainment content and becoming a depository of unpublished intellectual properties for resale with focus on achieving profitability and sustaining business growth. Our business model is based on acquiring unproduced and unpublished quality intellectual properties at a discount from studios, agencies and production companies for subsequent recycling or production in wide variety of media with the intent to resell back to the entertainment community for a profit. Regnum believes such an approach gives the Company an advantage over bigger studios that are competing for fresh scripts from writers who are in demand. Our founder, Director and sole officer, Ms. Tiffani Jones, is our only employee who manages the Company’s daily operations including development, strategy, negotiations and clerical work. Our principal offices are located at 1541 Ocean Avenue, Santa Monica, CA 90401, our telephone number is (310)881-6954. Our Company website is currently under development at www.regnumcorp.com. 
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an "emerging growth company", as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.
 
We could remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
 
Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a “smaller reporting company”, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a “smaller reporting company”, at such time are we cease being an “emerging growth company”, the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an “emerging growth company” or a “smaller reporting company”. Specifically, similar to “emerging growth companies”, “smaller reporting companies” are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an “emerging growth company” or “smaller reporting company” may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.
 
Business
 
Our business model is based on procuring unproduced and unpublished quality intellectual properties at a discount from independent writers, filmmakers, studios, agencies and production companies for subsequent reworking and/or production in wide variety of media with intent to resell back to the entertainment community for profit.

Business Process
 
Regnum business process entails seeking out and acquiring low budget unproduced and unpublished quality intellectual properties at a discount from independent writers, filmmakers, studios, agencies and production companies, reworking them into new commercially viable projects, and lastly, marketing and selling them back to the entertainment industry for a profit.
 
Identifying creative content that has resale potential amongst unproduced defunct and/or discarded intellectual property is a process that involves several phases. First, it is essential to select material that will entice interest from prospective film and TV producers, inspire them to see its potential and, ultimately, result in a sale. Regnum is finely tuned in to the most recent trends within the entertainment industry. To ensure that the material falls into a commercially viable genre, for each piece of intellectual property that Regnum rummages through an assessment is conducted to identify the trends in certain categories of film and television that enjoy popularity at the time. Next, Regnum determines the demands of prospective viewers that the future film or show will be aimed at to ensure the material is tailored to their expectations thus increasing the chances of the product sparking interest from potential buyers. Lastly, Regnum examines and evaluates popular films and shows in the chosen category to identify the creative and commercial attributes with the purpose of utilizing the gained prospective into the project. Regnum then moves to acquiring full rights to the obsolete original material it deems suitable at a symbolic or negotiated discounted price.
 
If needed, necessary modifications are then made to the original material. Since Regnum seeks to acquire full rights to the original material, we are free to alter its content or characters, or modify its format as we see fit and produce it in all kinds of media including novels, graphic novels, scripts for films and TV shows, web series, live stage shows, etc.
 
Once the original material has been recycled/reworked into a new project, it is ready for marketing. All phases of product development, marketing and sales are conducted by our chief executive officer Ms. Jones, who devotes full time to the Company’s operations.
 
Target Market
 
Regnum will target both television and film sectors of the entertainment industry with the aim of servicing the ever-increasing demand for premium content and becoming a depository of television and movie scripts for resale. To identify and select a target market, Regnum evaluated available industry and marketing information within the film and television entertainment showbiz. Regnum was able to establish that independent producers, TV executives, cable networks, etc. are all constantly on the search for new ideas to help reinvent the industry and bring a fresh form of entertainment to their viewers. Coming up with a concept that hasn't already been produced is a grueling task that can be time-consuming and require substantial financial resources. Therefore, the high end of this market is largely controlled by well-financed major studios and mega production companies like Paramount Pictures or Century Fox, etc. that are either competing for fresh scripts from popular writers who are in high demand, or engaging own studio-backed team of writers, or developing a new product with already built-in branding. For the lower end of the market spectrum, to save time and money and keep supplying TV networks with new shows and films, smaller Hollywood producers and development executives hustle to procure new material and often times rely heavily on third parties to bring them completed fresh aspiring projects to produce and distribute. This is the niche that Regnum has selected and will attempt to fill. 
 
Since Regnum seeks to acquire full rights to the original material to avoid any possibility of future claims, we only pursue the deals where the seller is willing to relinquish and assign all rights to Regnum. This may limit our choices, however, to the Company's benefit, there is a vast inventory of unproduced material accumulated over decades to choose from, and we do not anticipate shortage in acquiring unpublished content.
 
Current Projects
 
Since its inception, Regnum has acquired two bundles of various scripts and manuscripts from an independent production company and a producer at a deep discount for a total amount of $1,300 total, 17 of which were recycled and subsequently optioned off/sold for a total of $39,500. We will continue to follow our business plan to service the increasing demand for premium entertainment content by acquiring unproduced and unpublished quality intellectual properties at a discount for subsequent recycling and reselling back to the entertainment community for a profit, and hope to realize revenue in the future, however, we can provide no guarantees that we will be successful.
 
Currently, Regnum has secured all the resources and skills needed to acquire, recycle and market our products by utilizing our sole officer and director’s skills and experience in the fields of advertising and marketing, as well as entertainment. It is anticipated that, as the Company grows and develops over the next twelve months, its management team will be expanded from its current one member to consist of additional members who have expertise in the film and television entertainment industry, as well as entrepreneurial experience.

Revenue Model
 
To help undertake our efforts in a potentially effective way, Regnum has established “all rights” sales and “options” as main revenue-generating streams.
 
Regnum estimates that the majority of our revenues will come from sales of all rights to our intellectual properties, whereby a straightforward All Rights Contract will be signed transferring all the rights, claims and benefits of ownership to the purchaser at the time of sale for a negotiated price with no future payouts, fees or credits.
 
An Option Agreement is signed when a production company or producer elects to secure exclusive rights to intellectual property for a specified period of time. In exchange, Regnum will receive "option money" which is a deposit towards the negotiated purchase price that the Company will expect to receive once the intellectual property is sold to a studio or network, at which time the remainder of the purchase price is paid to Regnum. In the case when the project is not sold within the specified time frame, the option expires and ownership rights revert back to the Company.
 
In exceptional cases, Regnum might hire “show runners” for its most valuable projects who will be tasked with presenting them for sale to major television networks through their professional industry contacts. Show runners are only paid if and when a show/film is sold to a network, at which point Regnum receives revenue, and the show runner gets a predetermined compensation fee, which usually ranges between 3-5% of the total purchase price. To-date, Regnum has not hired any “show runners”.
 
Marketing
 
Regnum’s marketing objectives are to establish and maintain strong presence within our selected target market, as well as build a network of professional industry connections in the film and television segments of the entertainment industry. Management intends to maintain an extensive marketing campaign that will ensure maximum visibility for the business and will utilize a variety of marketing techniques and strategies, such as:

· | establishing online presence by designing a corporate website and engaging in social media campaigns to drive traffic to our website outlet and advertise our business and products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | approaching our target market by emailing newsletters to enhance our client base and keep our subscribers updated with new products and services; 
· | issuing press releases to obtain publicity and increase visibility for our business; 
· | participating in industry festivals, conferences and trade shows (e.g. Sundance, Tbibeca, Cannes, Toronto, etc.) to advertise our products, gain exposure and build industry connections.

Competition
 
The competition in the television and film industry ranges from major film and TV studios and production companies to small independent writers, producers and distributors. We base our competitive strategy on the fact that, despite stiff competition from about any established industry participant due to our lack of financial resources, business relationships and marketing tools, the barriers to entry into the industry are fairly low while demand for new entertainment content is high. Studios, producers, TV executives, cable networks, etc. are constantly scouting for fresh forms of entertainment to bring to their viewers. Our principal method of competition is to market specifically to small independent TV and film producers and agencies who generally lack the time and funding required to develop content themselves and instead rely on third parties to supply them with ready material. Regnum believes that our business model of acquiring unproduced and unpublished quality content at a discount and selling it to our selected target market for profit will give us the competitive advantage over bigger well-financed studios that are competing for fresh scripts from popular writers, and will help service the increasing demand for premium content. However, we cannot provide any assurances as to the likelihood of our success.
Government Regulation
 
Distribution rights to motion pictures are granted legal protection under the copyright laws of the United States and most foreign countries. These laws provide substantial civil and criminal sanctions for unauthorized duplication and exhibition of motion pictures. Motion pictures, musical works, sound recordings, art work, still photography and motion picture properties are separate works, subject to copyright under most copyright laws, including the United States Copyright Act of 1976, as amended. Regnum plans to take appropriate and reasonable measures to secure, protect and maintain or obtain agreements to secure, protect and maintain copyright protection for its intellectual properties under the laws of applicable jurisdictions.

Intellectual Property
 
Regnum has established “options” and “all rights” sales as its main revenue-generating streams. In the event of an “all rights” sale, Regnum relinquishes any rights to the intellectual property being sold. However, Regnum estimates that the majority of its revenues will come from options. In the event of an option sale, Regnum will retain its intellectual property rights, and an option agreement is signed allowing a production company or producer to secure exclusive rights to Regnum’s intellectual property for a specified period of time. In exchange, Regnum will receive “option money” which is a deposit towards the negotiated purchase price that the Company will expect to receive once the intellectual property is sold to a studio or network, at which time the remainder of the purchase price is paid to Regnum. In the case when the project is not sold within the specified time frame, the option expires and ownership rights revert back to the Company.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, our sole officer and director, Ms. Jones, is our only employee who manages the Company’s daily operations. Currently, Ms. Jones receives no compensation for her services, however she will be reimbursed for any expenses made on behalf of the Company. There is no written employment contract or agreement with Ms. Jones at this time. We also do not have any benefits, such as health of life insurance, available to our employee.
 
Regnum anticipates that additional employees will be hired in the future and employment agreements signed as our business expands.
