--------+----------


General
-------

 
We are engaged primarily in two business segments: movie theatres and hotels and resorts.
 
As of December 27, 2018, our theatre operations included 68 movie theatres with 889 screens throughout Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and Ohio, including one movie theatre with 6 screens in Wisconsin owned by a third party and managed by us. Following the completion of our acquisition of 22 Movie Tavern branded dine-in movie theatres (the “Movie Tavern Business”) on February 1, 2019 and the recent addition of one new screen at an existing theatre, we currently own or operate a total of 1,098 screens at 90 locations in 17 states. We also operate a family entertainment center, Funset Boulevard, that is adjacent to one of our theatres in Appleton, Wisconsin, and own the Ronnie’s Plaza retail outlet in St. Louis, Missouri, an 84,000 square foot retail center featuring 21 shops and other businesses to which we lease retail space. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are the 4th largest theatre circuit in the United States.
 
As of December 27, 2018, our hotels and resorts operations included eight wholly-owned or majority-owned and operated hotels and resorts in Wisconsin, Illinois, Nebraska and Oklahoma. We also managed 13 hotels, resorts and other properties for third parties in Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, Nevada, Nebraska, North Carolina and Texas. As of December 27, 2018, we owned or managed approximately 5,300 hotel and resort rooms.
 
Both of these business segments are discussed in detail below. For information regarding the revenues, operating income or loss, assets and certain other financial information of these segments for the last three full fiscal years, please see our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Note 12 in Part II below.

Strategic Plans
 
Please see our discussion under “Current Plans” in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
Theatre Operations
 
At the end of fiscal 2018, we owned or operated 68 movie theatre locations with a total of 889 screens in Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and Ohio. We averaged 13.1 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2018, compared to 13.0 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2017, compared to 13.0 screens at the end of fiscal 2016. Included in the fiscal 2018 total is one theatre with six screens that we manage for a third party and included in the fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 totals are two theatres with 11 screens that we manage for third parties. Our 67 company-owned facilities include 47 megaplex theatres (12 or more screens), representing approximately 80% of our total screens, 19 multiplex theatres (two to 11 screens) and one single-screen theatre. At the end of fiscal 2018, we operated 860 first-run screens, 6 of which we operated under management contracts, and 29 budget-oriented screens.
 
We invested over $320 million, excluding acquisitions, to further enhance the movie-going experience and amenities in new and existing theatres over the last five and one-half calendar years, with more investments planned for fiscal 2019. These investments include:
 
New theatres. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we opened two additional screens in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin at the Marcus Palace Cinema. In April 2017, we opened our new 10-screen Southbridge Crossing Cinema in Shakopee, Minnesota. This state-of-the-art theatre includes DreamLoungerSM recliner seating in all auditoriums, two UltraScreen DLX® auditoriums, as well as a Take FiveSM Lounge and Zaffiro’s® Express outlet. In June 2017, we opened our first stand-alone all in-theatre dining location, branded BistroPlex® located in Greendale, Wisconsin. This new theatre features eight in-theatre dining auditoriums with DreamLounger recliners, including two SuperScreen DLX® auditoriums, plus a separate full-service Take Five Lounge. In 2018, we began construction on a new food and beverage focused theatre in Brookfield, Wisconsin. We are currently evaluating the appropriate name and the amenities to be included in this new theatre, which is scheduled to open during our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. In addition, we are actively seeking additional sites for potential new theatre locations in both new and existing markets.
 
Theatre acquisitions. In addition to building new theatres, we believe acquisitions of existing theatres or theatre circuits is also a viable growth strategy for us. In April 2016, we purchased a closed 16-screen theatre in Country Club Hills, Illinois, building on our strong presence in the Chicago southern suburbs. We opened the newly renovated theatre early in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. In December 2016, we acquired the assets of Wehrenberg Theatres® (which we refer to as Wehrenberg or Marcus Wehrenberg), a family-owned and operated theatre circuit based in St. Louis, Missouri with 197 screens at 14 locations in Missouri, Iowa, Illinois and Minnesota. At the time, this acquisition increased our total number of screens by 29%. On February 1, 2019, we acquired the assets of Movie Tavern® by Marcus, a New Orleans-based industry leading circuit known for its in-theatre dining concept featuring chef-driven menus, premium quality food and drink and luxury seating. Movie Tavern consists of 208 screens at 22 locations in nine states – Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. This acquisition increased our total number of screens by an additional 23%. The movie theatre industry is very fragmented, with approximately 50% of United States screens owned by the three largest theatre circuits and the other 50% owned by an estimated 800 smaller operators, making it very difficult to predict when acquisition opportunities may arise. We do not believe that we are geographically constrained, and we believe that we may be able to add value to certain theatres through our various proprietary amenities and operating expertise.
 
DreamLounger recliner additions. These luxurious, state-of-the-art recliners allow guests to go from upright to a full-recline position in seconds. These seat changes require full auditorium remodels to accommodate the necessary 84 inches of legroom, resulting in the loss of approximately 50% of the existing traditional seats in an average auditorium. To date, the addition of DreamLoungers has increased attendance at each of our applicable theatres, outperforming nearby competitive theatres and growing the overall market attendance in most cases. We added DreamLounger recliner seats to seven theatres during fiscal 2018 (including three Marcus Wehrenberg theatres). As a result, as of December 27, 2018, we offered all DreamLounger recliner seating in 45 theatres, representing approximately 70% of our company-owned, first-run theatres. Including our premium, large format (PLF) auditoriums with recliner seating, as of December 27, 2018, we offered our DreamLounger recliner seating in approximately 75% of our company-owned, first-run screens, a percentage we believe to be the highest among the largest theatre chains in the nation. We are currently evaluating opportunities to add our DreamLounger premium seating to two additional theatres during the second half of fiscal 2019, including one Marcus Wehrenberg theatre. Currently, 12 of the 22 recently-acquired Movie Tavern theatres have recliner seating, with three additional theatres expected to be converted by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We have identified at least three additional Movie Tavern locations that we will consider converting to DreamLounger recliner seating during the second half of fiscal 2019. As a result, by the end of fiscal 2019, our percentage of total company-owned, first-run screens with DreamLounger recliner seating may be approximately 80%, including Movie Tavern theatres.

UltraScreen DLX and SuperScreen DLX (DreamLounger eXperience) conversions. We introduced one of the first PLF presentations to the industry when we rolled out our proprietary UltraScreen® concept approximately 20 years ago. We later introduced our UltraScreen DLX concept by combining our premium, large-format presentation with DreamLounger recliner seating and Dolby® Atmos™ immersive sound to elevate the movie-going experience for our guests. More recently, we began including heated DreamLounger recliner seating in our DLX auditoriums. During fiscal 2018, we converted one existing screen into an UltraScreen DLX auditorium and eight existing screens to SuperScreen DLX auditoriums at seven existing theatres (including four Marcus Wehrenberg screens). Most of our PLF screens now include the added feature of heated DreamLounger recliner seats. As of December 27, 2018, we had 29 UltraScreen DLX auditoriums, one traditional UltraScreen auditorium and 51 SuperScreen DLX auditoriums (a slightly smaller screen than an UltraScreen but with the same DreamLounger seating and Dolby Atmos sound) at 46 of our theatre locations. Three of our Marcus Wehrenberg theatres feature IMAX® PLF screens. As of December 27, 2018, we offered at least one PLF screen in approximately 72% of our first-run, company-owned theatres – once again a percentage we believe to be the highest percentage among the largest theatre chains in the nation. Our PLF screens generally have higher per-screen revenues and draw customers from a larger geographic region compared to our standard screens, and we charge a premium price to our guests for this experience. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the addition of a new UltraScreen DLX auditorium to a Marcus Wehrenberg theatre, and we are currently evaluating opportunities to convert 20 or more existing screens at 14 Movie Tavern theatres to UltraScreen DLX and SuperScreen DLX auditoriums during fiscal 2019. In addition, we expect that our new theatre currently under construction in Brookfield, Wisconsin will include one PLF auditorium.
 
Signature cocktail and dining concepts. We have continued to further enhance our food and beverage offerings within our existing theatres. We believe our 50-plus years of food and beverage experience in the hotel and restaurant businesses provides us with a unique advantage and expertise that we can leverage to further grow revenues in our theatres. The concepts we are expanding include:
 

· | Take Five Lounge and Take Five Express – these full-service bars offer an inviting atmosphere and a chef-inspired dining menu, along with a complete selection of cocktails, locally-brewed beers and wines. We opened one new Take Five Lounge outlet in fiscal 2018. As of December 27, 2018, we offered bars at 27 theatres, representing approximately 42% of our company-owned, first-run theatres. We are currently evaluating opportunities to add bar service to at least one additional theatre during fiscal 2019. In addition, all 22 Movie Tavern theatres have bars. As a result, including Movie Tavern, we now offer bar service in nearly 60% of our company-owned, first-run theatres.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Zaffiro’s Express – these outlets offer lobby dining that includes appetizers, sandwiches, salads, desserts and our signature Zaffiro’s THINCREDIBLE® handmade thin-crust pizza. In select locations without a Take Five Lounge outlet, we offer beer and wine at the Zaffiro’s Express outlet. We opened two new Zaffiro’s Express outlets during fiscal 2018, increasing our number of theatres with this concept to 28 as of December 27, 2018, representing approximately 44% of our company-owned, first-run theatres. We also operate three Zaffiro’s Pizzeria and Bar full-service restaurants. We expect that our new Brookfield, Wisconsin theatre currently under construction will include a Zaffiro’s Express.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Reel Sizzle® – this signature dining concept serves menu items inspired by classic Hollywood and the iconic diners of the 1950s. We offer Americana fare like burgers and chicken sandwiches prepared on a griddle behind the counter, along with chicken tenders, crinkle-cut fries, ice cream and signature shakes. As of December 27, 2018, we operated seven Reel Sizzle outlets, and we are evaluating an opportunity to add one Reel Sizzle outlet to an existing theatre during fiscal 2019. We expect that our new Brookfield, Wisconsin theatre currently under construction will include a Reel Sizzle.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other in-lobby dining – We also operate one Hollywood Café at an existing theatre, and four of the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres offer in-lobby dining concepts, operating under names such as Fred’s Drive-In or Five Star. In addition, we are currently testing additional in-lobby food options, including a Mexican food concept at two theatres, and we are considering expanding these new concepts during fiscal 2019. Including these additional concepts, as of December 27, 2018, we offered one or more in-lobby dining concepts in 40 theatres, representing approximately 63% of our company-owned, first-run theatres.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In-theatre dining – As of December 27, 2018, we offered full-service, in-theatre dining with a complete menu of drinks and chef-prepared salads, sandwiches, entrées and desserts at nine theatres and a total of 32 auditoriums, operating under the names Big Screen BistroSM, Big Screen Bistro ExpressSM and BistroPlex, representing approximately 14% of our company-owned, first-run theatres. With the addition of Movie Tavern, which consists entirely of in-theatre dining auditoriums, we now offer in-theatre dining in 31 theatres and 240 auditoriums, representing approximately 36% of our company-owned, first-run theatres.

We offer a “$5 Tuesday” promotion at every theatre in our circuit that includes a free complimentary-size popcorn to our loyalty program members. We have seen our Tuesday attendance increase dramatically since the introduction of the $5 Tuesday promotion. We believe this promotion has increased movie going frequency and reached a customer who may have stopped going to the movies because of price, creating another “weekend” day for us without adversely impacting the movie-going habits of our regular weekend customers. We introduced our $5 Tuesday promotion with the free popcorn for loyalty members at our Marcus Wehrenberg theatres immediately upon acquisition in December 2016 and did the same thing in February 2019 with our newly acquired Movie Tavern theatres. We experienced an increase in Tuesday performance at the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres and expect a similar response from customers at our Movie Tavern theaters. We also offer a “$6 Student Thursday” promotion at 36 Marcus and Marcus Wehrenberg locations that has been well received by that particular customer segment. We also introduced this promotion at 12 Movie Tavern locations late in our fiscal 2019 first quarter. In addition, we offer a $6 “Young-at-Heart” program for seniors on Friday afternoons that has also been introduced to our Movie Tavern locations during our fiscal 2019 first quarter.
 
We offer what we believe to be a best-in-class customer loyalty program called Magical Movie RewardsSM. We currently have approximately 3.1 million members enrolled in the program. Approximately 47% of all transactions in our theatres during fiscal 2018 were completed by registered members of the loyalty program. The program allows members to earn points for each dollar spent and access special offers available only to members. The rewards are redeemable at the box office, concession stand or at the many Marcus Theatres® food and beverage venues. In addition, we have partnered with Movio, a global leader in data analysis for the cinema industry, to allow more targeted communication with our loyalty members. The software provides us with insight into customer preferences, attendance habits and general demographics, which we believe will help us deliver customized communication to our members. In turn, members of this program can enjoy and plan for a more personalized movie-going experience. The program also gives us the ability to cost effectively promote non-traditional programming and special events, particularly during non-peak time periods. We believe that this will result in increased movie-going frequency, more frequent visits to the concession stand, increased loyalty to Marcus Theatres and ultimately, improved operating results. The acquired Wehrenberg theatres offered a loyalty program to their customers that had approximately 200,000 members. We converted these members to our Magical Movie Rewards program during fiscal 2017. The recently acquired Movie Tavern theatres did not offer a loyalty program to their customers. Our current plan is to introduce our Magical Movie Rewards program to these theatres during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 after all necessary technology requirements are completed.
 
We have enhanced, and expect to further enhance during fiscal 2019, our mobile ticketing capabilities, our downloadable Marcus Theatres mobile application, and our marcustheatres.com website. We will continue to install additional theatre-level technology, such as new ticketing kiosks, digital menu boards and concession advertising monitors. Each of these enhancements is designed to improve customer interactions, both at the theatre and through mobile platforms and other electronic devices.

The addition of digital technology throughout our circuit (we offer digital cinema projection on 100% of our first-run screens) has provided us with additional opportunities to obtain non-motion picture programming from other new and existing content providers, including live and pre-recorded performances of the Metropolitan Opera, as well as sports, music and other events, at many of our locations. We offer weekday and weekend alternate programming at many of our theatres across our circuit. The special programming includes classic movies, live performances, comedy shows and children’s performances. We believe this type of programming is more impactful when presented on the big screen and provides an opportunity to continue to expand our audience base beyond traditional moviegoers.
 
Revenues for the theatre business, and the motion picture industry in general, are heavily dependent on the general audience appeal of available films, together with studio marketing, advertising and support campaigns, factors over which we have no control. Consistent with prior periods in which blockbusters accounted for a significant portion of our total admission revenues, our top 15 performing films accounted for 41% of our fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 total admission revenues. The following five fiscal 2018 films accounted for nearly 23% of our total admission revenues for our circuit: Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, Incredibles 2, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Deadpool 2.
 
We obtain our films from several national motion picture production and distribution companies, and we are not dependent on any single motion picture supplier. Our booking, advertising, concession purchases and promotional activities are handled centrally by our administrative staff.
 
We strive to provide our movie patrons with high-quality picture and sound presentation in clean, comfortable, attractive and contemporary theatre environments. All of our movie theatre complexes feature digital cinema technology; either digital sound, Dolby or other stereo sound systems; acoustical ceilings; side wall insulation; engineered drapery folds to eliminate sound imbalance, reverberation and distortion; tiled floors; cup-holder chair-arms; and computer-controlled heating, air conditioning and ventilation. We offer stadium seating, a tiered seating system that permits unobstructed viewing, at substantially all of our first-run screens. Computerized box offices permit all of our movie theatres to sell tickets in advance and all of our recliner seating auditoriums offer reserved seating. Our theatres are accessible to persons with disabilities and provide wireless headphones for hearing-impaired moviegoers. Other amenities at certain theatres include touch-screen, computerized, self-service ticket kiosks, which simplify advance ticket purchases. We have an agreement to allow moviegoers to buy tickets on Fandango, the largest online ticket-seller. We have enhanced our web site and our mobile ticketing capabilities and added the Magical Movie Rewards loyalty program to our downloadable Marcus Theatres mobile application.
 
We have a master license agreement with a subsidiary of Cinedigm Digital Cinema Corp. to deploy digital cinema systems in the majority of our company-owned theatre locations. Under the terms of the agreement, Cinedigm’s subsidiary purchased the digital projection systems and licensed them to us under a long-term arrangement. The costs to deploy this new technology are being covered primarily through the payment of virtual print fees from studios to our selected implementation company, Cinedigm. Our goals from digital cinema included delivering an improved film presentation to our guests, increasing scheduling flexibility, providing a platform for additional 3D presentations as needed, as well as maximizing the opportunities for alternate programming that may be available with this technology. As of December 27, 2018, we had the ability to offer digital 3D presentations in 271, or approximately 32%, of our first-run screens, including the vast majority of our UltraScreens. Including the Movie Tavern theatres added during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we currently offer digital 3D presentations in 386, or approximately 36%, of our first-run screens. We have the ability to increase the number of digital 3D capable screens we offer to our guests in the future as needed, based on the number of digital 3D films anticipated to be released during future periods and our customers’ response to these 3D releases.
 
We sell food and beverage concessions in all of our movie theatres. We believe that a wide variety of food and beverage items, properly merchandised, increases concession revenue per patron. Although popcorn and soda remain the traditional favorites with moviegoers, we continue to upgrade our available concessions by offering varied choices. For example, some of our theatres offer hot dogs, pizza, ice cream, pretzel bites, frozen yogurt, coffee, mineral water and juices. We have also added self-serve soft drink dispensers and grab-and-go candy, frozen treat and bottled drink kiosks to many of our theatres. In recent years, we have added signature cocktail and dining concepts as described above. The response to our new food and beverage offerings has been positive, and we have plans to expand these food and beverage concepts at additional locations in the future.

We have a variety of ancillary revenue sources in our theatres, with the largest related to the sale of pre-show and lobby advertising (through our current advertising provider, Screenvision). We also obtain ancillary revenues from corporate and group meeting sales, sponsorships, internet surcharge fees and alternate auditorium uses. We continue to pursue additional strategies to increase our ancillary revenue sources.
 
We also own a family entertainment center, Funset Boulevard, adjacent to our 14-screen movie theatre in Appleton, Wisconsin. Funset Boulevard features a 40,000 square foot Hollywood-themed indoor amusement facility that includes a restaurant, party room, laser tag center, virtual reality games, arcade, outdoor miniature golf course and batting cages.
 
In connection with the Wehrenberg acquisition, we also acquired the Ronnie’s Plaza retail outlet in St. Louis, Missouri, an 84,000 square foot retail center featuring 21 shops and other businesses to which we lease retail space.

Managed Hotels, Resorts and Other Properties
 
We also manage hotels, resorts and other properties for third parties, typically under long-term management agreements. Revenues from these management contracts may include both base management fees, often in the form of a fixed percentage of defined revenues, and incentive management fees, typically calculated based upon defined profit performance. We may also earn fees for technical and preopening services before a property opens, as well as for ongoing accounting and technology services.
 
In January 2018, we assumed management of the newly-opened Murieta Inn and Spa in Rancho Murieta, California. Found within the development containing the renowned Murieta Equestrian Center, the largest equestrian facility in California, the 83-room hotel features The Gate, a one-of-a-kind restaurant and bar that offers fresh, seasonal menus using ingredients from the hotel’s five-acre farm and state-of-the-art greenhouse.

Competition
 
Both of our businesses experience intense competition from national, regional and local chain and franchise operations, some of which have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we have.  Most of our facilities are located in close proximity to competing facilities.
 
Our movie theatres compete with large national movie theatre operators, such as AMC Entertainment, Cinemark and Regal Cinemas, as well as with a wide array of smaller first-run exhibitors.  Movie exhibitors also face competition from a number of other movie exhibition delivery systems, such as digital downloads, video-on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs and network and syndicated television.  We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the public’s leisure time and disposable income.
 
Our hotels and resorts compete with the hotels and resorts operated and/or franchised by Hyatt Corporation, Marriott Corporation, Hilton Worldwide and others, along with other regional and local hotels and resorts.  Increasingly, we also face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry, such as peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms, such as Airbnb and HomeAway.  We compete for hotel management agreements with a wide variety of national, regional and local management companies based upon many factors, including the value and quality of our management services, our reputation, our ability and willingness to invest our capital in joint venture projects, the level of our management fees and our relationships with property owners and investors.
 
We believe that the principal factors of competition in both of our businesses, in varying degrees, are the price and quality of the product, quality and location of our facilities and customer service.  We believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of these factors.
 
Seasonality
 
Our first fiscal quarter typically produces the weakest operating results in our hotels and resorts division due primarily to the effects of reduced travel during the winter months. Our second and third fiscal quarters often produce our strongest operating results because these periods coincide with the typical summer seasonality of the movie theatre industry and the summer strength of the lodging business. Due to the fact that the week between Christmas and New Year’s Eve is historically one of the strongest weeks of the year for our theatre division, the specific timing of the last Thursday in December has an impact on the results of our fiscal first and fourth quarters in that division, particularly when we have a 53-week year.
Environmental Regulation
 
Federal, state and local environmental legislation has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, our activities in acquiring and selling real estate for business development purposes have been complicated by the continued emphasis that our personnel must place on properly analyzing real estate sites for potential environmental problems. This circumstance has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, greater time and increased costs involved in acquiring and selling properties associated with our various businesses.
Employees
 
As of December 27, 2018, we had approximately 8,000 employees, approximately 62% of whom were employed on a variable or part-time basis. A number of our (1) hotel employees at the Crowne Plaza Northstar in Minneapolis, Minnesota are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on April 30, 2019; (2) operating engineers at The Pfister Hotel and the Hilton Milwaukee City Center are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire on April 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively; (3) hotel employees at the Hilton Milwaukee City Center and The Pfister Hotel are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on March 15, 2019; and (4) painters in the Hilton Milwaukee City Center and The Pfister Hotel are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on May 31, 2022.
