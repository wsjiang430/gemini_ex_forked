ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
GENERAL
nVent Electric plc is a leading global provider of electrical connection and protection solutions. We believe our inventive electrical solutions enable safer systems and ensure a more secure world. We design, manufacture, market, install, and service high performance products and solutions that connect and protect some of the world’s most sensitive equipment, buildings, and critical processes. We offer a comprehensive range of enclosures, electrical connections and fastening, and thermal management solutions across industry-leading brands that are recognized globally for quality, reliability, and innovation. 
Our broad range of products and solutions connect and protect our customers’ mission-critical equipment from hazardous conditions, improving their utilization, lowering costs, and minimizing downtime. The cost of our products typically represents a small proportion of the total cost of our customers’ end systems as well as the potential cost of failure that our products help avoid. We have a portfolio of premier, industry-leading brands, including CADDY, ERICO, HOFFMAN, RAYCHEM, SCHROFF, and TRACER, some of which have a history spanning over 100 years, that cover a wide range of verticals, including Industrial, Commercial & Residential, Energy, and Infrastructure. 
Unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to "nVent," the "Company," and such words as "we," "us," and "our" include nVent Electric plc and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our principal office is in London, United Kingdom and our management office in the United States is in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Company was incorporated in Ireland on May 30, 2017. 
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT
On April 30, 2018, Pentair plc ("Pentair" or "Parent") completed the separation of its Water business and its Electrical business into two independent, publicly-traded companies (the "separation"). To effect the separation, Pentair distributed to its shareholders one ordinary share of nVent for every ordinary share of Pentair held as of the record date of April 17, 2018. As a result of the distribution, nVent is now an independent publicly-traded company and began "regular way" trading under the symbol "NVT" on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2018. 
Although our jurisdiction of organization is Ireland, we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") and therefore have our tax residency in the U.K.
Our roots within Pentair trace back to the acquisition of Federal-Hoffman Corporation in 1988, which included the HOFFMAN enclosures brand. From that starting point we have grown both organically and via acquisition. Our Enclosures business first applied lean principles within the organization in the 1990s, leveraging its culture of customer service and operational excellence. In 2012, Pentair merged with Tyco International Ltd.’s Flow Control division, which included our Thermal Management business and the RAYCHEM brand, a global leader in heat tracing solutions. In 2015, Pentair acquired ERICO Global Company, a leading global manufacturer of superior engineered electrical and fastening products, which operates as our Electrical & Fastening Solutions business, broadening our product offering and enabling us to provide additional global solutions to our combined customers. 
We aim to continue our journey as a “One nVent” organization, with unified focus on commercial excellence, digital transformation, scaled and integrated technology, including Internet of Things (“IoT”), and global presence and capabilities. As we scale our capabilities under our umbrella brand of nVent, we expect to expand our products and solutions and continue to differentiate our company by creating solutions that solve problems for our customers. 
Our strategy and culture are grounded in the values and purpose of lean, growth and talent management processes, designed to improve business performance, evaluate growth opportunities, and develop and retain employees. Through consistent application of these processes, we have been able to foster a culture of innovation, retain focus on the customer, and profitably grow our business. We will continue to use and improve these processes to drive sustained and profitable growth.

BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS
We operate across three segments: Enclosures, Thermal Management, and Electrical & Fastening Solutions. The following is a brief description of each of the Company's reportable segments and business activities. 
Enclosures 
Our Enclosures business provides innovative solutions to connect and protect critical electronics, communication, control, and power equipment. We are a leader in the enclosures sector, and our key brands, HOFFMAN and SCHROFF, have a long history of solving customers’ problems by providing high quality solutions. 
Hoffman provides enclosure solutions for challenging operating environments and is one of the largest brands of enclosures in North America and a leader globally. The offerings connect and protect critical control and power equipment through a comprehensive range of solutions used by panel builders, original equipment manufacturers and directly by other end-users, including customized products for hazardous environments. The HOFFMAN brand is over 70 years old and is recognized for delivering superior building, testing, certification and overall product quality. Hoffman’s product customization and global footprint, along with reputation, have helped it garner long-standing relationships with many of the world’s largest industrial companies. 
Schroff provides highly-customized and technologically-advanced enclosures and is one of our largest brands of enclosures in Europe. These products connect and protect mission-critical electronics and communications equipment by providing a wide range of innovative standard products and customized solutions. Schroff’s innovation is demonstrated by its constant flow of new product designs, including a focus on smart products capable of providing connectivity and remote management. The SCHROFF brand is a leader in ease of doing business due to its product flexibility and customer-first focus—approximately one-half of all SCHROFF products are customized. 
Thermal Management 
Our Thermal Management business provides electric thermal solutions that connect and protect critical buildings, infrastructure, industrial processes, and people. Its highly reliable and easy-to-install solutions lower total cost of ownership to building owners, facility managers, operators, and end users. Thermal Management’s products have been installed in some of the world’s most iconic buildings.
For Industrial and Energy, we provide industrial heat-tracing and wiring, control and monitoring, sensing, engineering, and construction services under industry leading RAYCHEM and TRACER brands, primarily serving the energy and power industries. Products and solutions include heat tracing for freeze protection and process temperature maintenance, temperature control and monitoring systems, heat-traced tubing bundles, instrument winterization, and tank heating systems. For Commercial and Infrastructure, we provide products and services primarily under our RAYCHEM brand. Applications include pipe freeze protection, roof and gutter de-icing, surface snow melting, hot water temperature maintenance, floor heating, and freeze and frost prevention for hospitals, sports venues, hotels, commercial offices, and education facilities. 
Electrical & Fastening Solutions 
Our Electrical & Fastening Solutions business provides fastening solutions that connect and protect electrical and mechanical systems and civil structures. 
We are a global leader in fastening solutions with spring steel and specialty metal fixings and reinforced steel connections, and our products are primarily marketed under the CADDY brand. Our products reduce total installed cost, provide design flexibility and increase structural integrity in electrical and mechanical fastening applications through inventive products and solutions and customer intimacy. These products are targeted towards Commercial and Industrial verticals with applications in fire & seismic, data & telecommunications, electrical fastening, and heating, ventilation & air conditioning. These products are primarily used by electricians, telecommunications installers, and roof top contractors. 
We are also a global leader in bonding, grounding, lightning protection, and low voltage power distribution products and solutions. These products are primarily marketed under the ERICO brand. We offer a comprehensive range of facility electrical connection and protection solutions to protect against electrical transients to improve safety and reliability of electrical systems. Our products reduce total cost of ownership and provide design flexibility by offering maintenance free and reliable products and global end-user application expertise and intimacy. These products and solutions are primarily used by electricians, panel builders, energy contractors, and lightning protection installers.

Competition 
We believe that we are a global leader in each of our segments. Given the range of products and services we offer, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including large, global competitors, established regional competitors, and niche competitors in select regions. We face increased competition in a number of our verticals as a result of new local competitors who compete on price and increased consolidation in specific segments. The Enclosures segment faces significant competition in the verticals it serves, particularly within the communications industry, where product design, prototyping, global supply, price competition, and customer service are significant factors. The Thermal Management segment serves industries and verticals that are highly fragmented, and competes with local and niche suppliers. The Electrical & Fastening Solutions segment serves industries and verticals that are relatively fragmented, with a small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller competitors. Competition for our Thermal Management and Electrical & Fastening Solutions segments focuses on product performance, quality, service and price. 
Our success depends on a variety of factors, including technical expertise, reputation for quality and reliability, timeliness of delivery, previous installation history, contractual terms, and price. As many of our products sell through electrical distributors, data center contractors, original equipment manufacturers, greenfield development contractors and maintenance contractors, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel and distribution network. 
Seasonality 
We generally experience increased demand for Thermal Management products and services during the fall and winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and increased demand for Electrical & Fastening Solutions products during the spring and summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. 
Backlog of Orders by Segment
 | December 31
In millions | 2018 | 2017 | $ change | % change
Enclosures | $ | 138.6 | | $ | 132.4 | | $ | 6.2 | | 4.7 | % 
Thermal Management | 118.6 | | 123.4 | | (4.8 | ) | (3.9 | ) 
Electrical & Fastening Solutions | 22.5 | | 24.6 | | (2.1 | ) | (8.5 | ) 
Total | $ | 279.7 | | $ | 280.4 | | $ | (0.7 | ) | (0.2 | )%

A substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and product delivered in the same month. Our backlog typically has a short manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order. However, a portion of our backlog, particularly from orders for major capital projects, can take more than one year depending on the size and type of order. We record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers, which represent firm commitments, and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract. We expect the majority of our backlog at December 31, 2018 will be shipped in 2019. Despite the favorable long-term outlook for our end-markets, we experience volatility in the level of our backlog depending on the end-market and may continue to do so over the medium and longer term.
Raw materials
The principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are mild steel, stainless steel, electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies), copper and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels.
We purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market and the majority is available through multiple sources which are in adequate supply. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments, principally price commitments, for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which long-term commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Certain commodities, such as metals and resin, are subject to market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances. Prices for raw materials, such as metals and resins, may trend higher in the future.

Intellectual property
Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies, customer relationships, trademarks, trade names and brand names are important to our business. However, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer relationship, trademark, trade name or brand name.
Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of patents, patent applications or license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 9,000 people worldwide.
Captive insurance subsidiary
We insure certain general and product liability, property, workers' compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, Tonka Bay Insurance Company ("Tonka Bay"). Reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. Accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties, such as liabilities arising from acquired businesses, pre-Tonka Bay liabilities and those of certain non-U.S. operations are established.
Matters pertaining to Tonka Bay are discussed in ITEM 3, included in this Form 10-K.
