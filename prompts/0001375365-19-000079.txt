Item 1.        Business
Overview
We are a Silicon Valley founded, headquartered and operated provider of application-optimized high performance and high-efficiency server and storage systems. We develop and provide end-to-end green computing solutions to the cloud computing, data centers, enterprise, big data, artificial intelligence ("AI"), High-Performance Computing ("HPC"), edge computing and Internet of Things/embedded (“IoT”) markets. Our solutions range from complete server, storage, modular blade servers, blades and workstations to full racks, networking devices, server management software, server sub-systems and global support and services. We offer our customers a high degree of flexibility and customization by providing a broad array of server configurations from which they can choose the optimal solutions to fit their computing needs. Our server and storage systems, subsystems and accessories are architecturally designed to provide high levels of reliability, quality, configurability, and scalability.
We perform the majority of our research and development efforts, at our San Jose, California headquarters, which we believe increases the efficiency of communication and collaboration between design teams, streamlines the development process and reduces time-to-market. This building block approach allows us to provide a broad range of products and enables us to build and deliver application-optimized solutions based upon customers’ requirements.
Our resource-saving architecture continues our tradition of leading the market with green IT innovation. Leveraging an overall architecture that optimizes data center power, cooling, shared resources and refresh cycles, we believe this approach helps the environment and provides total cost of ownership (“TCO”) savings for our customers. Furthermore, our architecture disaggregates central processing units (“CPU”) and memory, which allows each resource to be refreshed independently thereby allowing data centers to reduce refresh cycle costs.
We conduct our operations principally from our Silicon Valley headquarters in California and subsidiaries in Taiwan and the Netherlands. Our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a combination of our direct sales force and indirect sales channel partners. In our indirect sales channels, we work with distributors, value added resellers, system integrators, and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") to market and sell our optimized solutions to their end customers. During each of the fiscal years 2019 and 2018, we sold to over 850 direct customers in over 110 countries. During the same periods, through our indirect sales channels, we have also sold to numerous end users. We commenced operations in 1993 and have been profitable every year since inception.

We also have a series of agreements with Compuware, including multiple product development, production and service agreements, product manufacturing agreements and lease agreements for office space. See Part II, Item 8, Note 12, “Related Party Transactions” to the consolidated financial statements and Part III, Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence.”
We monitor our inventory continuously to be able to meet customer delivery requirements and to avoid inventory obsolescence. Due to our building-block designs, our inventory can generally be used with multiple different products, lowering working capital requirements and reducing the risk of inventory write-downs.
Competition
The market for our products is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to new technological developments, changing customer needs and new product introductions. In particular, in recent years the market has been subject to substantial change. We compete primarily with large vendors of X86 based general purpose servers and components. In addition, we also compete with smaller vendors that specialize in the sale of server components and systems. Over the last several years, we have experienced increased competition from Original Design Manufacturers ("ODMs”) that benefit from their scale and very low cost manufacturing and are increasingly offering their own branded products. We believe our principal competitors include:

• | Global technology vendors such as Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Huawei, IBM, and Lenovo; and


• | ODMs, such as Inspur, Quanta Computer, and Wiwynn Corporation. 

The principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

• | First to market with new emerging technologies;


• | High product performance, efficiency and reliability;


• | Early identification of emerging opportunities;


• | Cost-effectiveness;


• | Interoperability of products;
