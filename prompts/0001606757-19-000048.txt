Overview
Kimball Electronics was founded in 1961 and was incorporated in 1998. We are a global, multifaceted manufacturing solutions provider. We provide contract electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”) and diversified manufacturing services, including engineering and supply chain support, to customers in the automotive, medical, industrial, and public safety end markets.  We offer a package of value that begins with our core competency of producing “durable electronics” and have expanded into diversified contract manufacturing services for non-electronic components, medical disposables, and precision molded plastics. This package of value includes our set of robust processes and procedures that help us ensure that we deliver the highest levels of quality, reliability, and service throughout the entire life cycle of our customers’ products.  We believe our customers appreciate our body of knowledge as it relates to the design and manufacture of their products that require durability, reliability, the highest levels of quality control, and regulatory compliance.  We deliver award-winning service from our highly integrated global footprint which is enabled by a largely common operating system, a standardization strategy, global procedures, and teamwork.  Our Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) model is key to providing our customers convenient access to our global footprint and all of our services throughout the entire product life cycle.  Because our customers are in businesses where engineering changes must be tightly controlled and long product life cycles are common, our track record of quality, financial stability, social responsibility, and commitment to long-term relationships is important to them.
The Company acquired GES Holdings, Inc., Global Equipment Services and Manufacturing, Inc., and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “GES”) on October 1, 2018, which specialize in design, production, and servicing of automation, test, and inspection equipment for industrial applications in the semiconductor, electronics, and life sciences industries. 
We have been producing safety critical electronic assemblies for our automotive customers for over 30 years.  During this time, we have built up a body of knowledge that has not only proven to be valuable to our automotive customers, but to our medical, industrial, and public safety customers as well.  We have been successful in growing and diversifying our business by leveraging our automotive experience and know-how in the areas of design and process validation, traceability, process and change control, and lean manufacturing to create valuable and innovative solutions for customers in the medical, industrial, and

public safety end market verticals.  These solutions include diversified contract manufacturing services for medical disposables, precision molded plastics, and now provided through GES, design, production, and servicing of automation, test, and inspection equipment for industrial applications. We have harmonized our quality systems to be compliant with various important industry certifications and regulatory requirements.  This allows us to take advantage of other strategic points of leverage in the supply chain and within our operations so we can cost-effectively manufacture electronic and non-electronic products in the same production facility for customers from all four of our end market verticals.
Many of our customers are multinational companies that sell their products in multiple regions of the world.  For these customers, it is important for them to be able to leverage their investment in their supply partner relationships such that the same partner provides them with engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain support in multiple regions of the world. It is common for us to manufacture the same product for the same customer in multiple locations.  Our strategy for expanding our global footprint has aligned us with the preferences of the customers in our four end market verticals and has positioned us well to support their global growth initiatives.  Our global systems, procedures, processes, and teamwork combined with our CRM model have allowed us to accomplish this goal for many of our largest customers.
Our global processes and central functions that support component sourcing, procurement, quoting, and customer pricing provide commonality and consistency among the various regions in which we operate. We have a central, global sourcing organization that utilizes procurement processes and practices to help secure sources from around the world and to ensure sufficient availability of components and a uniform approach to pricing while leveraging the purchase volume of the entire organization. Customer pricing for the products we produce is primarily managed centrally utilizing a standardized quoting model regardless of where our customers request their products to be produced.
Our CRM model combines members of our team from within our manufacturing facilities and members of our business development team who reside remotely and nearer to our customers around the world.  We also have cross functional teams in the areas of quality, operational excellence, quoting, and design engineering with representatives from our various locations that provide support to our teams on a global basis. The skill sets of these team members and the clarity in their roles and responsibilities help provide our customers with a strong conduit that is critical to execution and forming a strong relationship.  We have institutionalized a customer scorecard process that provides all levels of our company with valuable feedback that helps us drive the actions for continuous improvement.  Our customer scorecard process has helped us deliver award-winning service and build loyalty with our customers.
Our corporate headquarters is located at 1205 Kimball Boulevard, Jasper, Indiana. Production occurs in our facilities located in the United States, China, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Thailand, and Vietnam.  
Our services are sold globally on a contract basis, and we produce products to our customers’ specifications.  Our manufacturing services primarily include:

• | Design services and support;


• | Supply chain services and support;


• | Rapid prototyping and new product introduction support;


• | Product design and process validation and qualification;


• | Industrialization and automation of manufacturing processes;

Spin-Off
Kimball Electronics, Inc. was a wholly owned subsidiary of Kimball International, Inc. (“former Parent” or “Kimball International”) and on October 31, 2014 became a stand-alone public company upon the completion of a spin-off from former Parent. In conjunction with the spin-off, on October 31, 2014, Kimball International distributed 29.1 million shares of Kimball Electronics common stock to Kimball International Share Owners. Holders of Kimball International common stock received three shares of Kimball Electronics common stock for every four shares of Kimball International common stock held on October 22, 2014. Kimball International structured the distribution to be tax free to its U.S. Share Owners for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Reporting Segment
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Each of our business units qualifies as an operating segment with its results regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. Our operating segments meet the aggregation criteria under the current accounting guidance for segment reporting. As of June 30, 2019, all of our business units provide contract manufacturing services for electronic and other assemblies or components primarily in automotive, medical, industrial, and public safety applications, all to the specifications and designs of our customers. The nature of the products, the production process, the type of customers, and the methods used to distribute the products, all have similar characteristics. Each of our business units service customers in multiple markets and many of our customers’ programs are manufactured and serviced by multiple business units. We leverage global processes such as component procurement and customer pricing that provide commonality and consistency among the various regions in which we operate. All of our operating segments have similar long-term economic characteristics and, as such, have been aggregated into one reportable segment. 
Our Business Strategy
We intend to achieve sustained, profitable growth in the markets we serve by supporting the global growth initiatives of our customers, and we will continue our development into a multifaceted manufacturing solutions company. Key elements of executing our strategy include:

• | Leveraging Our Global Footprint – continue our strategy of utilizing our presence in key global regions, including new potential country locations and/or facility expansion as our customer demands dictate;

We value our customers and their unique needs and expectations.  Our customer focus and dedication to unparalleled excellence in engineering and manufacturing has resulted in proven success in the contract manufacturing industry. Personal relationships are important to us.  We strive to build long-term global partnerships.  Our commitment to support our customers is backed by our history and demonstrated performance over the past 50 years.
Marketing Channels
Manufacturing services, including engineering and supply chain support, are marketed by our business development team. We use a CRM model to provide our customers with convenient access to our global footprint and all of our services throughout the entire product life cycle.
Major Competitive Factors
Key competitive factors in the markets we serve include competitive pricing, quality and reliability, engineering design services, production flexibility, on-time delivery, customer lead time, test capability, and global presence. Numerous contract manufacturing service providers compete globally for business from existing and potential customers. We also face competition from our customers’ own capacity and capabilities to in-source production. Growth in the EMS industry is created through the proliferation of electronic components in today’s advanced products and the continuing trend of original equipment manufacturers in the electronics industry subcontracting the assembly process to companies with a core competency in this area. The nature of the EMS industry is such that the start-up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently. New customer and program start-ups generally cause losses early in the life of a program, which are generally recovered as the program becomes established and matures. Our continuing success depends upon our ability to replace expiring customers/programs with new customers/programs.
We do not believe that we, or the industry in general, have any special practices or special conditions affecting working capital items that are significant for understanding our business other than fluctuating inventory levels which may increase in conjunction with the start-up of new programs and component availability.
Our Competitive Strengths
Our competitive strengths derive from our experience of producing safety critical electronic assemblies for automotive customers for over 30 years and leveraging this experience to create valuable and innovative solutions for customers in different industries. Our core strengths include:

• | Our core competency of producing durable electronics;


• | Our body of knowledge as it relates to the design and manufacture of products that require high levels of quality control, reliability, and durability;


• | Our highly integrated, global footprint;


• | Our capability to provide our customers diversified contract manufacturing services for non-electronic components, medical disposables, precision molded plastics, and automation, test, and inspection equipment;


• | Our CRM model and our customer scorecard process;


• | Our ability to provide our customers with valuable input regarding designs for improved manufacturability, reliability, and cost;


• | Our quality systems, industry certifications, and regulatory compliance;


• | Our integrated supply chain solutions and competitive bid process resulting in competitive raw material pricing; and


• | Complete product life cycle management.

Competitors
The EMS industry is very competitive as numerous manufacturers compete for business from existing and potential customers. Our competition includes EMS companies such as Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Jabil Inc., and Plexus Corp. We do not have a significant share of the EMS market and were ranked the 19th largest global EMS provider for calendar year 2018 by Manufacturing Market Insider in the March 2019 edition published by New Venture Research.
Locations
As of June 30, 2019, we have eleven manufacturing facilities with two located in Indiana, two in China, and one located in each of California, Florida, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continually assess our capacity needs and evaluate our operations to optimize our service levels for supporting our customers’ needs around the globe. During fiscal year 2019, we acquired GES which has manufacturing facilities in California, China, and Vietnam. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for information regarding financial and operational risks related to our international operations and acquisitions.

Seasonality
Consolidated sales revenue is generally not affected by seasonality.
Customers 
While the total electronic assemblies market has broad applications, our customers are concentrated in the automotive, medical, industrial, and public safety industries. 
Sales by industry as a percent of net sales for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2019 were as follows:

 | Year Ended June 30
 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017
Automotive | 40% | 44% | 41% 
Medical | 31% | 29% | 28% 
Industrial | 22% | 20% | 22% 
Public Safety | 6% | 6% | 7% 
Other | 1% | 1% | 2% 
Total | 100% | 100% | 100%

Included in our sales were a significant amount to Philips, ZF, and Nexteer Automotive, which accounted for the following portions of net sales:

 | Year Ended June 30
 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017
Philips | 14% | 13% | 14% 
ZF | 12% | 15% | 12% 
Nexteer Automotive | 12% | 13% | 12% 

The nature of the contract manufacturing business is such that start-up of new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently. Our agreements with customers are often not for a definitive term and are amended and extended, but generally continue for the relevant product’s life cycle, which can be difficult to predict at the beginning of a program.  Typically, our customer agreements do not commit the customer to purchase our services until a purchase order is provided, which are generally short-term in nature. Our customers generally have the right to cancel a particular program subject to contractual provisions governing termination, the final product runs, excess or obsolete inventory, and end-of-life pricing, which reduces the additional costs that we incur when a manufacturing services agreement is terminated. 
Backlog
The aggregate sales price of production pursuant to unfulfilled customer orders, which in certain cases may be canceled by the customer subject to contractual termination provisions, was $417.8 million and $293.1 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Open orders have increased partly as a result of certain key customers placing orders with increased lead times. Substantially all of the open orders as of June 30, 2019 are expected to be filled within the next fiscal year. Open orders may not be indicative of future sales trends due to the contract nature of our business. 
Raw Materials
Raw materials utilized in the manufacture of contract electronic products are generally readily available from both domestic and foreign sources, although from time to time the industry experiences shortages of certain components due to supply and demand forces, combined with rapid product life cycles of certain components. In addition, unforeseen events such as natural disasters can and have disrupted portions of the supply chain. We believe that maintaining close communication with suppliers helps minimize potential disruption in our supply chain. 
Raw materials are normally acquired for specific customer orders and may or may not be interchangeable among products. Inherent risks associated with rapid technological changes within this contract industry are mitigated by procuring raw materials, for the most part, based on firm orders. In certain instances, such as when lead times dictate, we enter into contractual agreements for material in excess of the levels required to fulfill customer orders. In turn, material authorization agreements with customers cover a portion of the exposure for material which is purchased prior to having a firm order. We may also purchase additional inventory to support new product introductions, transfers of production between manufacturing facilities, and to mitigate the potential impact from component shortages.

Intellectual Property
Our primary intellectual property is our proprietary manufacturing technology and processes which allow us to provide competitive contract manufacturing services to our customers. As such, this intellectual property is complex and normally contained within our facilities. The nature of this know-how does not lend itself well to traditional patent protection. In addition, we feel the best protection strategy involves maintaining our intellectual property as trade secrets because there is no disclosure of the information to outside parties, and there is no expiration on the length of protection. For these reasons, we do not own any patents that we consider significant to our business. Our registered trademarks consist of the “Kimball” name as registered in certain categories relating to our electronics manufacturing and design services, which was assigned to us by former Parent, and the “GES and Design” trademark acquired through the GES acquisition.
Environment and Energy Matters
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with present laws and regulations and that there are no material liabilities related to such items.
We are dedicated to excellence, leadership, and stewardship in protecting the environment and communities in which we have operations. We believe that continued compliance with foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations which have been enacted relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Management believes capital expenditures for environmental control equipment during the two fiscal years ending June 30, 2021 will not represent a material portion of total capital expenditures during those years. 
Our operations require significant amounts of energy, including natural gas and electricity. Federal, foreign, and state regulations may control the allocation of fuels available to us, but to date we have experienced no interruption of production due to such regulations.
Employees
As of June 30, 2019, Kimball Electronics employed approximately 6,300 people worldwide, with approximately 1,300 located in the United States and approximately 5,000 located in foreign countries. Our U.S. operations are not subject to collective bargaining arrangements. Certain foreign operations are subject to collective bargaining arrangements, many mandated by government regulation or customs of the particular countries. We believe that our employee relations are good.
