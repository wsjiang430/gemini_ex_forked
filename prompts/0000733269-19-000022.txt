Industry 
We are experiencing a convergence of several key industry trends that are shaping the future of how data is used to power the customer experience economy. Some of these key trends include:
Growing Data Usage
Advances in software and hardware and the growing use of the Internet have made it possible to collect and rapidly process massive amounts of personal data. Data vendors are able to collect user information across a wide range of offline and online properties and connected devices, and to aggregate and combine it with other data sources. This data can be integrated with its own proprietary data and can be made non-identifiable if the use case requires it. Through the use of these data sources, together with real-time feedback on consumer reactions to the ads, data-driven advertising increases the value of impressions for marketers, inventory owners and viewers who receive more personalized and relevant ads.
Tremendous Complexity 
The customer experience economy has evolved significantly in recent years driven by rapid innovation and an explosion of data, channels, devices, and applications. Historically, brands interacted with consumers through a limited number of channels, with limited visibility into the activities taking place. Today, companies interact with consumers across a growing number of touchpoints, including online, social, mobile and point-of-sale. The billions of interactions that take place each day between brands and consumers create a trove of valuable data that can be harnessed to power better interactions and experiences. However, most enterprise marketers remain unable to cut through the complexity to effectively leverage this data.
Increasing Fragmentation

Today, customer journeys span multiple channels and devices over time, resulting in data silos and fragmented identities. As consumers engage with brands across various touchpoints – over the web, mobile devices and applications, by email and television, and in physical stores – they may not be represented as single unique individuals with complex behaviors, appearing instead as disparate data points with dozens of different identifiers. Becky Smith who lives at 123 Main Street may appear as beckys@acme.com when she uses Facebook, becky@yahoo.com when she signs into Yahoo Finance, cookie 123 when she browses msn.com, cookie ABC when she browses aol.com, and so on. As a result, enterprise marketers struggle to understand the cross-channel, cross-
device habits of consumers and the different steps they take on their path to conversion. More specifically, data silos and fragmented identities prevent companies from being able to resolve all relevant data to a specific individual; this poses a challenge to the formation of accurate, actionable insights about a brand’s consumers or campaigns.
Marketing Waste

Every day, brands spend billions of dollars on advertising and marketing, yet many of the messages they deliver are irrelevant, repetitive, mistimed, or simply reach the wrong audience. In addition, as the marketing landscape continues to grow and splinter across a growing array of online and offline channels, it is increasingly difficult to attribute marketing spend to a measurable outcome, such as an in-store visit or sale. Wasted marketing spend is largely driven by the fragmented ecosystem of brands, data providers, marketing applications, media providers, and agencies that are involved in the marketing process, but operate without cohesion. Without a common understanding of consumer identity to unify otherwise siloed data, brands are unable to define accurate audience segments and derive insights that would enable better decision making.
Heightened Privacy and Security Concerns

In the era of regulation such as the European General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), diligence in the areas of consumer privacy and security is and will continue to be paramount. Consumer understanding of the benefits of marketing technology often lags the pace of innovation, inspiring new demands from government agencies and consumer advocacy groups across the world. These factors challenge the liability every company faces when managing and activating consumer data.

Marketing and Customer Experience in the Data-Driven Era
As the world becomes more multichannel, consumer behavior is rapidly shifting, and organizations are increasingly realizing that true competitive advantage lies in providing meaningful customer experiences – experiences that are personalized, relevant and cohesive across all channels and interactions. Experience is the key to brand differentiation and retention. A recent Forrester Consulting study of global organizations found that experience-driven businesses grow revenues 1.4x the rate of other companies and enjoy significantly higher customer retention rates. Companies that fail to prioritize customer experience as a strategic growth initiative will simply get left behind. 
In concert, consumer expectations are also at an all-time high – in fact, 67% of consumers say their standard for good experiences is higher than it has ever been. Consumers are demanding personalization – and, in this new area, every consumer interaction has the potential to be individually relevant, addressable, and measurable. 
Data is at the center of exceptional customer experiences but is still vastly underutilized. Organizations must capture, analyze, understand – and, most importantly use – customer data to power the customer experience. By understanding which devices, email addresses, and postal addresses relate to the same individual, enterprise marketers can leverage that insight to deliver seamless experiences as consumers engage with a company across all touchpoints. At the same time, by reaching consumers at the individual level, organizations can reduce marketing waste and more easily attribute their marketing spend to actual results. Enterprise marketers recognize the huge opportunity big data brings, yet more than 60% admit they are not using their data to effectively drive their customer experience.
Growing Complexity
Innovation has fueled the growth of a highly-fragmented technology landscape, forcing companies to contend with thousands of marketing technologies and data silos. To make every customer experience relevant across channels and devices, organizations need a trusted platform that can break down those silos, make data portable, and accurately recognize individuals throughout the customer journey. Marketing is becoming more audience-centric, automated, and optimized. However, several important factors still prevent data from being used effectively to optimize the customer experience:
•Identity. For organizations to target audiences at the individual level, they must be able to recognize consumers across all channels and devices, and link multiple identifiers and data elements back to a persistent identifier to create a single view of the customer.
•Scaled Data Assets. Quality, depth, and recency of data matters when deriving linkages between identifiers. Organizations must have access to an extensive set of data and be able to match that data with a high degree of accuracy to perform true cross-device audience targeting.
•Connectivity. The fragmented marketing landscape creates a need for a common network of integrations that make it easy and safe to match and activate data anywhere in the ecosystem.
•Walled Gardens. Walled gardens, or marketing platforms that restrict the use of data outside of their walls, are becoming more pervasive and can result in loss of control, lack of transparency, and fragmented brand experiences. Organizations need a solution that enables an open ecosystem and ensures complete control over customer data, along with the flexibility to choose a diversified approach to meeting marketing goals.
•Ethical Use of Data. Preserving brand integrity and delivering positive customer experiences is a top priority for every enterprise. Organizations must be able to manage large sets of complex data ethically, securely, within legal boundaries, and in a way that protects consumers from harms.
Our Approach
Companies want to enable better decisions, improve ROI and deliver better experiences to its customers – and it all begins with data. However, given the rapid adoption of new platforms and channels, enterprise marketers remain plagued by fragmented data – resulting in a shallow, incomplete or incorrect understanding of the people they do business with. Data today is still too hard to access, too hard to make sense of and too hard to activate across all the touchpoints where it could power better decision-making and better experiences. Data fragmentation is the reason companies struggle to deliver relevant, consistent and meaningful experiences to their customers. Our mission is to break down silos and make data safe and easy to use. Leveraging our core capabilities in data access, identity resolution, connectivity and data stewardship, we create the foundation off which the ecosystem can deliver innovative products and services. 
We are middleware for the customer experience economy. LiveRamp provides the trusted platform that sits in between customer data and the thousands of applications that data could power. We make data consistent, consumable and portable. We ensure the seamless transition of data to and from the customer experience applications our customers use. We empower businesses to make data more accessible and create richer, more meaningful experiences for their customers.
The LiveRamp Platform
As depicted in the graphic below, we power the industry’s leading enterprise customer management platform. We enable organizations to access and leverage data more effectively across the applications they use to interact with their customers. A core component of our platform is the omnichannel, deterministic identity graph that sits at its center. Leveraging this knowledgebase, the LiveRamp platform resolves a customer’s data (first-, second-, or third-party) to consumer identifiers that represent real people in a way that protects consumer privacy. This omnichannel view of the consumer can then be activated across any of the 600 partners in our ecosystem in order to support a variety of people-based marketing solutions, including:
•Onboarding. We enable customers to leverage their first-party data in the digital and TV ecosystems through a safe and secure data matching process called data onboarding. Our technology ingests a customer’s first-party data, removes all offline data (personally-identifiable or "PII"), and replaces them with anonymized IDs called IdentityLinks, a true people-based identifier. IdentityLinks can then be distributed through direct integrations to the top platforms in the digital ecosystem, including leading DMPs and DSPs, publishers and social networks, personalization tools, and connected TV services.
•Identity Resolution. We provide enterprise-level identity resolution with accuracy, reach, privacy, flexibility and scale. Our identity resolution capabilities are built from two complementary graphs, combining offline data and online data and providing the highest level of accuracy while still being privacy compliant. LiveRamp technology for PII gives brands and platforms the ability to connect and update what they know about consumers, resolving PII across enterprise databases and systems to deliver better customer experiences in a privacy-conscious manner. Our digital identity graph associates anonymous device IDs, cookie IDs and other online customer IDs from premium publishers, platforms or data providers, around an IdentityLink. This allows marketers to perform the personalized segmentation, targeting, and measurement use cases that require a consistent view of the user in anonymous spaces.
•Data Networks. We enable the search, discovery and distribution of data, with access to trusted industry leading third-party data globally. The LiveRamp platform allows users to organize, group and access customer data, connected via IdentityLink, to benefit from better campaign targeting and audience intelligence. Our platform also provides the tools for data providers to manage the organization, access, and operation of their data and services available across platforms, publishers, agencies, brands, and data companies. Providers and buyers can also choose to leverage our neutral data marketplace (see below for discussion on Data Store), featuring 180 providers across all verticals and data types.
•Measurement & Analytics. We power more accurate, more complete measurement with the measurement vendors and partners our customers use. Our platform allows customers to combine disparate data files (typically ad exposure and customer events, like transactions), replacing customer identifiers with IdentityLinks. Customers then can use that aggregated view of each customer for measurement of reach and frequency, sales lift, closed loop offline to online conversion and cross-channel attribution.
•Analytics Environments. We also help enable in-house data science analytics, providing an end-to-end customized measurement solution designed for marketers looking to create an omnichannel view of their customer journey. Leveraging our identity graph, we help organizations control and aggregate all their customer data to interrogate, explore, analyze and report within our data science environment, that powers the deep functionality of a data lake.
•Consent Management. Our Consent Management Platform ("CMP") empowers consumers to maintain their privacy while facilitating business for brands and publishers. Our CMP informs website visitors about the data being collected on them and how it will be used. We provide the tools to give consumers control and choice over their personal data, publishers the solutions to operate sustainable business models, and brands the ability to advertise more relevantly and effectively.
Consumer privacy and data protection, what we call Data Ethics, are at the center of how we design our products and services. Accordingly, the LiveRamp platform operates with technical, operational, and personnel controls designed to keep our customers’ data private and secure.
Our solutions are sold to enterprise marketers and the companies they partner with to execute their marketing, including agencies, marketing technology providers, publishers and data providers. Today, we work with over 665 direct customers world-wide, including approximately 20% of the Fortune 500, and serve thousands of additional customers indirectly through our reseller partnership arrangements. 
•Brands and Agencies. We work with over 300 of the largest brands and agencies in the world, helping them execute people-based marketing by creating an omni-channel understanding of the consumer and activating that understanding across their choice of best-of-breed digital marketing platforms.
•Marketing Technology Providers. We provide marketing technology providers with the identity foundation required to offer people-based targeting, measurement and personalization within their platforms. This adds value for brands by increasing reach, as well as the speed at which they can activate their marketing data.
•Publishers. We enable publishers of any size to offer people-based marketing on their properties. This adds value for brands by providing direct access to their customers and prospects in the publisher's premium inventory. 
•Data Owners. Leveraging our vast network of integrations, we allow data owners to easily connect to the digital ecosystem and monetize their own data. Data can be distributed to clients or made available through the LiveRamp Data Store feature. This adds value for brands as it allows them to augment their understanding of consumers and increase both their reach against and understanding of customers and prospects.
We primarily charge for IdentityLink on an annual subscription basis. Our subscription pricing is based primarily on data volume supported by our platform.
Data Store
As we have scaled the LiveRamp network and technology, we have found additional ways to leverage our platform, deliver more value to clients and create incremental revenue streams. Leveraging our common identity system and broad integration network, the LiveRamp Data Store is a data marketplace that seamlessly connects data owners’ audience data across the marketing ecosystem. The Data Store allows data owners to easily monetize their data across hundreds of marketing platforms and publishers with a single contract. At the same time, the Data Store provides a single gateway where data buyers, including platforms and publishers, in addition to brands and their agencies, can access high-quality third-party data from more than 180 data owners, supporting all industries and encompassing all types of data. Data providers include sources and brands exclusive to LiveRamp, emerging platforms with access to previously unavailable deterministic data, and data partnerships enabled by our platform. 
We primarily generate revenue from the Data Store through revenue-sharing arrangements with data owners that are monetizing their data assets on our marketplace. This revenue is typically transactional in nature, tied to data volume purchased on the Data Store. 
Competitive Strengths

Our competitive strengths can be mapped back to our core capabilities around data access, identity, connectivity and data stewardship – which together create strong network effects that form a larger strategic moat around the entire business.
•Extensive Coverage. We activate data across an ecosystem of more than 600 partners, representing the largest network of connections in the digital marketing space. We use 100% deterministic matching, resulting in the strongest combination of reach and accuracy. Through our Data Store, we offer multi-sourced insight into approximately 700 million consumers worldwide, and over 5,000 data elements from hundreds of sources with permission rights.
•Most Advanced Consumer-Level Recognition. Our proprietary, patented recognition technology draws upon an extensive historical reference base to identify and link together multiple consumer records and identifiers. We use the pioneering algorithms of AbiliTec® and deterministic digital matching to link individuals and households to the right digital identifiers including cookies, mobile device IDs, Advanced TV IDs, and user accounts at social networks. As a result, we are able to match online and offline data with a high degree of speed and accuracy.
•Scale Leader in Data Connectivity. We are the category creator and largest provider of identity and data connectivity at scale. We match records with the highest level of accuracy and offer the most flexibility for activating data through our extensive set of integrations. Our platform processes more than 4 trillion data records daily.
•Unique Position in Marketing Ecosystem. We are the only open and neutral enterprise customer management platform operating at large scale. We provide the data connectivity required to build best-of-breed integrated marketing stacks, allowing our customers to innovate through their preferred choice of data, technology, and services providers. We strive to make every customer experience application more valuable by providing access to more customer data. We enable the open marketing stack and power the open ecosystem.
•Standard Bearer for Privacy and Security. LiveRamp has been a leader in data stewardship and a strong and vocal proponent of providing consumers with more visibility and control over their data. A few examples of our commitment in this area:
◦In all of our major geographies we have Privacy teams focused on the protection and responsible use of consumer data
◦The use of our privacy-enabled environment that allows marketers and partners to connect different types of data while protecting and governing its use
◦Industry-leading expertise in safely connecting data across the online and offline worlds
◦In fiscal 2020, the acquisition and integration of Faktor to streamline consent management across the open ecosystem. Faktor is a global consent management platform that allows consumers to better manage how and where their data is used. 
•Strong Customer Relationships. We work with over 665 direct customers world-wide and serve thousands of additional customers indirectly through our partner and reseller network. We have deep relationships with companies and marketing leaders in key industries, including financial services, retail, telecommunications, media, insurance, health care, automotive, technology, and travel and entertainment. Our customers are loyal and typically grow their use of the platform over time, as evidenced by our strong net dollar retention rate, which has been at least 115% during the last eight quarters.
Growth Strategy

LiveRamp is a category creator, thought leader and innovator in how data is used to power the customer experience. Key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Grow our Customer Base. We have strong relationships with many of the world’s largest brands, agencies, marketing technology providers, publishers and data providers. Today, we work with over 665 direct customers globally; however, we believe our target market includes the world’s top 3,000 enterprises, signaling there is still significant opportunity to add new customers to our roster. We expect to continue making investments in growing our sales and customer success team to support this strategy.
•Expand Existing Customer Relationships. A key growth lever for our business is the ability to land and expand – or grow existing customer relationships. Our subscription pricing is tiered based on data volume, so over time, as customers expand their usage and leverage their data across more use cases, we are able to grow our relationships. Today, we work with over 45 clients paying us $1 million or more, and as we continue to expand our coverage beyond programmatic, we expect to see this number grow. 
•Continue to Innovate and Extend Leadership Position in Identity. We intend to establish LiveRamp as the standard for consumer-level recognition across the marketing ecosystem, providing a single source of user identity for audience targeting, measurement and personalization.
•Establish LiveRamp as the Trusted, Best and Essential Industry Standard for Connected Data. We intend to continue to make substantial investments in our platform and solutions and extend our market leadership through innovation. Our investments will focus on automation, speed, higher match rates, expanded partner integrations and use cases, and new product development. 
•Expand Global Footprint. Many of our customers and partners serve their customers on a global basis, and we intend to expand our presence outside of the United States to serve the needs of our customers in additional geographies. As we expand relationships with our existing customers, we are investing in select regions in Europe and Asia.
•Expand Addressable Market. Historically, our focus has been to enable data-driven advertising in the programmatic space. As customers look to deploy data across additional use cases, we intend to power all advertising use cases and expand our role inside the enterprise. Advanced TV, B2B and second-party data are great examples of this strategy. In addition, over time, we intend to pursue adjacent markets beyond marketing, like risk and fraud, healthcare and government, where similar identity and data connectivity challenges exist.
•Build an Exceptional Business. We do not aspire to be mediocre, good, or even great – we intend to be the absolute best in everything we do. We employ exceptional people, challenge them to accomplish exceptional things, and achieve exceptional results for our clients and shareholders. We will do this through five guiding principles: 1) Above all, we do what is right; 2) We always say what we mean and do what we say; 3) We empower people; 4) We respect people and time; and 5) We get stuff done. 
Privacy Considerations

The growing online advertising and e-commerce industries are converging, with consumers expecting a seamless experience across all channels, in real time.   This challenges marketing organizations to balance the deluge of data and demands of the consumer with responsible, privacy-compliant methods of managing data internally and with advertising technology intermediaries. 

We have policies and operational practices governing our use of data that we believe reflect leading best practices and actively promote a set of effective privacy guidelines for digital advertising and direct marketing via all channels of addressable media, e-commerce, risk management and information industries as a whole. We are certified under the European Union ("EU")-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield programs in an effort to ensure our continued ability to process information across borders. We have a dedicated team in place to oversee our compliance with the data protection regulations that govern our business activities in the various countries in which we operate. 

The U.S. Congress continues to debate data privacy legislation, and there are many different types of data privacy legislation pending at the state level. In all of the non-U.S. locations in which we do business, laws and regulations governing the collection and use of personal data either exist or are being developed.

We expect the trend of enacting and revising data protection laws to continue and that new and expanded data privacy legislation in various forms will be implemented in the U.S. and in other countries around the globe.  We are supportive of legislation that codifies current industry guidelines of accountability-based data governance that includes meaningful transparency for the individual, and appropriate controls over personal information and choice whether that information is shared with independent third parties for marketing purposes. We also support legislation requiring all custodians of sensitive information to deploy reasonable information security safeguards to protect that information.

Customers

Our customer base consists primarily of Fortune 1000 companies and organizations in the financial services, insurance, information services, direct marketing, retail, consumer packaged goods, technology, automotive, healthcare, travel and communications industries as well as in non-profit and government sectors. Given the strong network effects associated with our platform, we work with both enterprise marketers and the companies they partner with to execute their marketing, including agencies, marketing technology providers, publishers and data providers. 
We seek to maintain long-term relationships with our clients. Our average subscription contract is one year in duration, although some of our customers are entering into multi-year subscriptions. Our customers are loyal and typically grow their use of the platform over time, as evidenced by our strong net dollar retention rate, which has been consistently north of 115% over the last eight quarters.
Our ten largest clients represented approximately 32% of our revenues in fiscal year 2019 but no single client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues.   

Sales and Marketing

Our sales teams focus on new business development across all markets – sales to new clients and sales of new lines of business to existing clients, as well as revenue growth within existing accounts. We organize our customer relationships around customer type and industry vertical, as we believe that understanding and speaking to the nuances of each industry is the most effective way to positively impact our customers’ businesses.
Our partner organization focuses on enabling key media partners, agencies and software providers who can help drive value for our customers. 
Our marketing efforts are focused on increasing awareness for our brand, executing thought-leadership initiatives, supporting our sales team and generating new leads. We seek to accomplish these objectives by hosting and presenting at industry conferences, hosting client advisory boards, publishing white papers and research, public relations activities, social media presence and advertising campaigns.
Research and Development

Research and development expense was $85.7 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $60.7 million in fiscal 2018, and $49.4 million in fiscal 2017.  Management expects to maintain investment spending at similar levels in fiscal 2020.
Competition

Competitors to LiveRamp are typically also members of our partner and reseller ecosystem, creating a paradigm where competition is the norm. Our primary competitors are companies that sell data onboarding as part of a suite of marketing applications or services. Walled gardens that offer a direct interface for matching CRM data compete for a portion of our services, particularly amongst marketers that have not yet adopted in-house platforms for programmatic marketing or attribution. Some providers of tag management, data management, and cross-device marketing solutions have adopted positioning similar to our business and compete for mindshare. In markets outside the United States, we primarily face small local market players. 
We continue to focus on levers to increase our competitiveness and believe that investing in the product and technology platform of our business is a key to our continued success. Further, we believe that enabling a broad partner ecosystem will help us to continue to provide competitive differentiation.
Seasonality and Inflation 
Although we cannot accurately determine the amounts attributable to inflation, we are affected by inflation through increased costs of compensation and other operating expenses. If inflation were to increase over the low levels of recent years, the impact in the short run would be to cause increases in costs, which we would attempt to pass on to our clients, although there is no assurance that we would be able to do so. Generally, the effects of inflation in recent years have been offset by technological advances, economies of scale and other operational efficiencies.
While the majority of our business is not subject to seasonal fluctuations, our Marketplace and other business experiences modest seasonality, as the revenue generated from this area of the business is more transactional in nature and tied to advertising spend. For example, many advertisers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. We expect our Marketplace and other revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole.
Pricing
More than 80% of our revenue is derived from monthly recurring subscription fees sold on an annual basis. Our subscription pricing is tiered based on data volume supported by our platform. We also generate revenue from data providers, digital publishers and advanced TV platforms in the form of revenue-sharing agreements.
Employees

LiveRamp employs approximately 950 employees (LiveRampers) worldwide. No U.S. LiveRampers are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. To the best of management’s knowledge, 2 LiveRampers are elected members of work councils or trade unions representing LiveRamp employees in the European Union. LiveRamp has never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
