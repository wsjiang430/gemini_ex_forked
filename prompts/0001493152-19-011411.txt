ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BACKGROUND
 
We were incorporated as Pharmascan Corp. in the State of Nevada on March 31, 2009. On September 21, 2010, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to Technologies Scan Corp.
 
On April 1, 2014, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to “PetVivo Holdings, Inc.”
 
On March 11, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the execution of a securities exchange agreement dated March 11, 2014 (the “Securities Exchange Agreement”) with PetVivo Inc., a Minnesota corporation (“PetVivo”). PetVivo was founded in 2013 by John Lai and John Dolan and engaged in the business of acquiring/in-licensing and adapting human biomedical technology and products for commercial sale in the veterinary market.
 
In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Securities Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of PetVivo in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate 2,310,939,804 shares of our common stock to the PetVivo shareholders as adjusted for a reverse stock split effective soon after this merger; this made PetVivo our wholly-owned subsidiary. John Lai and John Dolan were controlling shareholders of Petvivo Holdings, Inc at the time of the securities exchange.
 
In 2013, PetVivo entered into an exclusive worldwide license for the commercialization of a patented biomaterials technology developed by Gel-Del Technologies Inc., a Minnesota corporation (“Gel-Del”). Gel-Del was a biomaterials development and manufacturing company focused on human and companion animal applications of its biomaterials technology; our initial product, Kush®, is derived from the licensed technology. Kush is comprised of a patented, gel-like, protein-based biomaterial which may be injected into the afflicted body parts of companion animals suffering from osteoarthritis. Kush’s predecessor formulation completed a Gel-Del-sponsored 145 patient First-in-Man IDE clinical trial using the novel thermoplastic biomaterial as dermal filler for human cosmetic applications
 
Gel-Del Technologies, Inc. Acquisition
 
In exchange for 1,450,000 shares of the Company’s common stock the Company entered into a certain exclusive license agreement and manufacturing and supply agreement dated August 2, 2013 (the “License Agreement”) with Gel-Del pertaining to the manufacture and supply of products by Gel-Del derived from certain technology, including protein-based biomaterials and devices, which are beneficial for the veterinary treatment of animals having orthopedic joint afflictions (the “Technology”). We have since terminated the License Agreement based upon consummation of the Gel-Del merger as indicated in this section Gel-Del Technologies, Inc. Acquisition.
 
In 2014, subsequent to the securities exchange agreement between PetVivo Holdings, Inc. and PetVivo, Inc., and the execution of the License Agreement with Gel-Del Technologies, Inc., PetVivo Holdings’ management and the management of Gel-Del entered into discussion to combine the two companies and produce, market and sell medical products based on Gel-Del technology for both human and animal indications.
 
In November 2014 the respective Boards of Directors and executive officers of our company and of Gel-Del entered into a merger agreement between our company and Gel-Del, subject to approval of our shareholders and Gel-Del shareholders. Shareholder approval of this merger was obtained from shareholders of Gel-Del in March 2015 and from our shareholders in April 2015, and concurrently we also appointed the directors of Gel-Del to our Board of Directors. We then controlled Gel-Del, combined all Gel-Del operations with ours, and were responsible to provide future funding for Gel-Del. Accordingly, we concluded that Gel-Del was a variable interest entity (VIE) for which we were the primary beneficiary and that for accounting purposes, we would consolidate our financial statements with those of Gel-Del with the assets and liabilities of Gel-Del stated at their fair value. We also determined the fair value of the Gel-Del assets and liabilities was based on the $4.02 per share trading price of our common stock at April 10, 2015, resulting in the total purchase consideration being $18,978,462.

We were unable to consummate the 2014 merger agreement with Gel-Del in a timely fashion due primarily to a substantial decline in the value of our publicly-traded common stock during 2015-2016. In order to complete the Gel-Del merger, in early 2017 we agreed to provide Gel-Del an additional 31.3% of our common shares than was required in the initial merger agreement. Accordingly, our management and Gel-Del management revised the structure and terms of the Gel-Del merger to provide for the issuance of these additional shares to Gel-Del and to effect the transaction through a statutory triangular merger. The Gel-Del merger was then completed under Minnesota Statutes whereby Gel-Del and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (which was incorporated in Minnesota expressly for this transaction) completed the triangular merger (the “Merger”). Pursuant to the Merger, Gel-Del was the surviving entity and concurrently became our wholly-owned subsidiary, resulting in our obtaining full ownership of Gel-Del. Our primary reason to effect the Merger was to obtain 100% ownership and control of Gel-Del and its patented bioscience technology, including ownership of Gel-Del’s Cosmeta subsidiary. The effective date for the Merger was April 10, 2017 when the Merger was filed officially with the Secretary of State of Minnesota.
 
Pursuant to the Merger, we issued a total of 5,450,000 shares of our common stock pro rata to the pre-merger shareholders of Gel-Del, resulting in each outstanding common share of Gel-Del being converted into 0.798 common share of the Company; .634 share was issued in relation to the merger and .164 share was issued pursuant to the License Agreement. The 5,450,000 shares represented approximately 30% of our total post-merger outstanding common shares and were valued at the closing price of our common shares on the effective date of the Merger of $0.40 per share, resulting in total consideration of $2,180,000. Incident to completion of the Merger, we also recorded an impairment loss of approximately $14,700,000 in order to account for the decline in our initial valuation of Gel-Del in 2015. For additional information regarding our accounting treatment of the Gel-Del merger and the related large impairment loss recorded in 2017 due to the decline in value of Gel-Del from the initial uncompleted merger transaction and the 2017 completed merger transaction, see Note 11 to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Company Overview
 
We are headquartered in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota. We are a veterinary biotech and biomedical device company primarily engaged in the business of translating or adapting human biotech and medical technology into products for commercial sale in the veterinary market to treat companion animals such as dogs, horses and cats, and other animals suffering from arthritis and other afflictions. Our initial product, Kush, is an injectable comprised of patented, gel-like biomaterials that is being commercialized for companion animal osteoarthritis
 
PetVivo’s proprietary biomaterials simulate a body’s cellular tissue by virtue of their reliance upon natural protein compositions which incorporate such “tissue building blocks” as collagen and elastin. Since these are naturally-occurring in the body, we believe they have an enhanced biocompatibility with living tissues compared to synthetic biomaterials such as those based upon alpha-hydroxy polymers (PLA, PLGA and the like) and other “natural” biomaterials that may lack the multiple proteins incorporated into our biomaterials. These proprietary, protein-based biomaterials appear to mimic the body’s tissue thus allowing integration, tissue repair, and possibly regeneration in long-term implantation. The inherent thermoplastic properties of these biomaterials are then utilized to manufacture or coat implantable devices or as use as stand-alone injectables. These biomaterials are produced using a patented and scalable self-assembly production process. We are commercializing the technology in the veterinary field for the treatment of osteoarthritis.

CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS
 
General
 

We are an emerging biomedical device company focused on the licensing and commercialization of innovative medical devices and therapeutics for pets, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We operate in the $19 billion US veterinary care market that has grown at a CAGR of 4.8% over the past five years according to the American Pet Products Association. Despite the market size, veterinary clinics and hospitals have very few treatments and/or drugs for use in treating osteoarthritis in pets and other animals. The role of pets in the family has greatly evolved in recent years. Many pet owners consider their pets an important member of the family. They are now willing to spend greater amounts of money on their pets to maintain their health and quality of life. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to leverage investments already expended in the development of human therapeutics to commercialize treatments for pets in a capital and time-efficient way. A key component of this strategy is the accelerated timeline to revenues for veterinary medical devices, which enter the market earlier than the more stringently regulated veterinary pharmaceuticals or human therapeutics.
 
We launched our lead product, Kush® in calendar Q2 2018. In Q4 2018 we issued a “Notice of Product Quarantine and Product Monitoring Period” notifying all product holders to suspend use of the product and place it in quarantine while the Company, through utilization of third-party testing vendors, perform additional testing of the product. Kush is a veterinarian-administered joint injection for the treatment of osteoarthritis and lameness in dogs and horses. The Kush device is made from natural components that are lubricious and cushioning to perform like cartilage for the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis.
 

We believe that Kush is a superior treatment that safely improves joint function. The reparative Kush particles are lubricious, cushioning and long-lasting. The spongy, protein-based particles mimic the composition and protective function of cartilage (i.e., providing both a slippery cushion and healing scaffolding) and protect the joint as an artificial cartilage. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using industry sources, we estimate osteoarthritis afflicts approximately 20 million owned dogs in the United States and the European Union, making canine osteoarthritis a $4 billion market opportunity if selling the product at $200 per canine unit; this does not factor in any contra-lateral usage of the product by veterinarians. See Johnston, Spencer A. “Osteoarthritis. Joint anatomy, physiology, and pathobiology.” The Veterinary clinics of North (1997):699-723; 
http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/petoverpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html; 
and http://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp. 

 

In addition to being a treatment for osteoarthritis, the joint-cushioning and lubricity effects of Kush have shown an ability to treat equine lameness that is due to navicular disease (a problem associated with misalignment of joints and bones in the hoof and digits).
 
Based on a variety of industry sources we estimate that 1 million owned horses in the United Stated and European Union suffer from lameness and/or navicular disease each year, making the equine lameness and navicular disease market an annual opportunity worth $600 million if selling the product at $600 per equine unit; this does not factor in any contra-lateral usage of the product by veterinarians. See Kane, Albert J., Josie Traub-Dargatz, Willard C. Losinger, and Lindsey P. Garber; “The occurrence and causes of lameness and laminitis in the US horse population” Proc Am Assoc Equine Pract. San Antonio (2000): 277-80; Seitzinger, Ann Hillberg, J. L. Traub-Dargatz, A. J. Kane, C. A. Kopral, P. S. Morley, L. P. Garber, W. C. Losinger, and G. W. Hill. “A comparison of the economic costs of equine lameness, colic, and equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM).” In Proceedings, pp. 1048-1050. 2000; and Kilby, E. R. 10 CHAPTER, The Demographics of the U.S. Equine Population, The State of the Animals IV: 2007.

Osteoarthritis is a condition with degenerating cartilage, creating joint stiffness from mechanical stress resulting in inflammation and pain. The lameness caused by osteoarthritis worsens with time from the ongoing loss of protective cushion and lubricity (i.e., loss of slippery padding). There are currently very few, if any, treatments for osteoarthritis; some of which are palliative pain therapy and joint replacement. Non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to alleviate the pain and inflammation, but long-term use has been shown to cause gastric problems. NSAIDs do not treat the cartilage degeneration issue to halt or slow the progression of the osteoarthritis condition.
 
We believe that our treatment of osteoarthritis in canines using Kush is far superior to the current methodology of using NSAIDs. NSAIDs have many side effects, especially in canines, whereas the company’s treatment using Kush, to our knowledge, has not elicited any adverse side effects in dogs. Remarkably, Kush-treated dogs have shown an increase in activity even after they no longer are receiving pain medication.
 
No special training is required for the administration of the Kush device. The treatment is injected into synovial joint space using standard intra-articular injection technique and multiple joints can be treated simultaneously. Kush immediately treats effects of osteoarthritis with no special post-treatment requirements.
 
Historically, drug sales represent up to 30% of revenues at a typical veterinary practice (Veterinary Practice News). Revenues and margins at veterinary practices are being eroded because online, big-box and traditional pharmacies recently started filling veterinary prescriptions. Veterinary practices are looking for ways to replace the lost prescription revenues. Our treatments expand practice revenues and margins because they are veterinarian-administered. The Kush device is veterinarian-administered to expand practice revenues and margins. We believe that the increased revenues and margins provided by Kush will accelerate its adoption rate and propel it forward as the standard of care for canine and equine lameness related to or due to synovial joint issues.
 
Our current pipeline includes 17 therapeutic devices for both veterinary and human clinical applications. Some of the therapeutic devices for veterinary and human clinical applications may be regulated by the FDA or other equivalent regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). Such regulatory agencies will implement approval and regulatory oversight processes similar to those identified herein in the section labeled “Regulation – Human and Veterinary Use.”

In our past couple filings of our annual report on Form 10-K, we included a current pipeline table as above which was incorrect, and the foregoing table has been revised to reflect our current estimates of each product for the above categories. The primary reason we failed to satisfy the respective estimated dates in any earlier filings was because we did not receive anticipated substantial funding needed to satisfy those earlier performance estimates.
 
We anticipate growing our product pipeline through the acquisition or in-licensing of additional proprietary products from human medical device companies specifically for use in pets. In addition to commercializing our own products in strategic market sectors and in view of the company’s vast proprietary product pipeline, the Company anticipates establishing strategic out-licensing partnerships to provide secondary revenues.
 
We plan to commercialize our products in the United States through distribution relationships supported by regional and national distributors and complemented by the use of digital marketing to educate and inform pet owners; and in Europe and rest of world through commercial partners.
 
Most veterinarians in the United States buy a majority of their equipment and supplies from one of four veterinary-product distributors. Combined, these four distributors deliver more than 85%, by revenue, of the products sold to companion animal veterinarians in the U.S. We plan to have our product distribution leverage the existing supply chain and veterinary clinic and clinician relationships already established by these large distributors. We plan to support this distribution channel with regional sales representatives. Our representatives will support our distributors and the veterinary clinics and hospitals. We will also target pet owners with product education and treatment awareness campaigns utilizing a variety of digital marketing tools. The unique nature and the anticipated benefits provided by our products are expected to generate significant consumer response.
 
Our biomaterials have been through a human trial and have been classified as a medical device. The FDA does not require submission of a 510(k) or formal pre-market approval for medical devices used in veterinary medicine.

Below is a listing of applications of our technology that we plan to commercialize or out-license to strategic partners:
 
Dermal Filler
 

Our biomaterials are constructed from purified water, protein, and carbohydrate, tailored to simulate different body tissues that biologically integrate (bio-integration). Our biomaterials can be manufactured and used as a dermal filler for wrinkle treatment by injection. These formed, gel particles fill, integrate and rejuvenate dermal skin tissue to remove the wrinkle. This product was taken through an FDA clinical trial under the name CosmetaLife®, see the results here: www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00414544). 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cardiovascular Devices
 

Our blood-compatible biomaterial, which allows blood contact and bio-integrative processes to occur without clotting, platelet attachment, or thrombogenesis, is used to repair cardiovascular tissue. VasoGraft®, a blood vessel graft made from VasoCover™ material, is designed to mimic natural blood vessel tissue in almost every respect, including the components used. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drug Delivery
 

Unique fabrication techniques allow us to homogeneously distribute drug in milligram to nanogram amounts, resulting in optimum performance and manufacturing capabilities for a variety of delivery methods, such as coatings, injectables, implantables or transmucosal delivery. The first planned transmucosal product has been optimized and tested with peptide drugs with better efficacy than oral dosing via swallowing. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Orthopedic Devices
 

Another of our materials can be used in a variety of shapes for orthopedic and dental applications. The first products, OrthoGelic™ and OrthoMetic™, will be aimed at difficult-to-heal, non-union broken bones, by using particles to fill the empty space. The orthopedic biomaterial, made to mimic the structural components of bone, can allow integration and healing to fill in the break and exclude non-bone tissue infiltration.

To maximize the strength and value of our patent portfolio, many of the claims use the transitional term “comprising”, which is synonymous with “including,” This use of transitional language is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps. Our patents also include method claims covering many of the applications and uses of the biomaterials as medical devices and drug delivery systems. With eight issued or allowed United States Patents that contain 287 claims, our intellectual property portfolio strongly protects our proprietary technology, including the composition of raw elements used to produce our formulations, the fabricated biomaterials and their application in end products, thereby making our material and devices much more attractive to industry partners.
 
We will seek to protect our products and technologies through a combination of patents, regulatory exclusivity, and proprietary know-how. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current compounds and any future compounds developed. We also strenuously protect our proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements, trade secrets and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.
 
We depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, including those of our company, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which may not be patentable, and inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment of ownership to us the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
 
Companion Animal Market
 

Over the last several decades, we believe the animal health market and industry has a strong component in the overall U.S. economy and is more resistant to economic cycles. The veterinary sector is as an attractive area to participate in the growth of the broader healthcare industry without reimbursement risk. Based on our best knowledge, U.S. consumers will spend an estimated $75 billion on pets this year—a number that leads to a CAGR of more than 5% over the five years (APPA). Vet Care constitutes about $19 billion of the market, while Therapeutics, a subsection of Vet Care, constitutes a smaller amount. However, we believe Therapeutics is poised to expand as pet care becomes more complex and companies launch new products for unmet needs. The growth in the U.S. companion animal market has been continuing to increase due to the increase in the number of pet-owning households. The American Pet Products Association (APPA) 2017-2018 National Pet Owners Survey indicates U.S. pet ownership reached record levels in 2018. Specifically, 68% of all U.S. households owned a pet in 2018. That’s 84.6 million pet-owning households, up from 79.7 million in 2015 – a 3-year CAGR of approximately 2%. In 2018, dogs and cats were the most popular pet species, owned by 47% and 37% of U.S. households, respectively. APPA also reported that there were 89.7 million dogs (6-year CAGR of +2.3%) and 94.2 million cats (6-year CAGR of +1.4%) in the U.S. In comparison, the total U.S. human population had a +0.7% CAGR over the last eight years. APPA reported that 2% of U.S. households owned horses in 2018. According to the APPA the total number of horses owned by U.S. households increased to 7.6 million in 2018, a number consistent with the previous APPA report conducted two year earlier.

Osteoarthritis Market
 
Osteoarthritis, the most common inflammatory joint disease in both dogs and horses, is a progressive condition that is caused by a deterioration of joint cartilage. Over time, the joint cartilage deterioration creates joint stiffness from mechanical stress resulting in inflammation, pain and loss of range of motion, which may be referred to as lameness. Osteoarthritis joint stiffness and lameness worsens with time from gradual cartilage degeneration and an ongoing loss of protective cushion and lubricity (i.e., loss of slippery padding). As there is no cure for osteoarthritis, the various treatment methods are focused on managing the related symptoms of pain and inflammation. Veterinarians recommend several treatments depending on the severity of the disease, including a combination of rest, weight loss, physical rehabilitation, and a regimen of pain and anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to alleviate the pain and inflammation caused by OA, but long-term NSAIDs cause gastric problems. Moreover, NSAIDs do not treat the cartilage degeneration issue to halt or slow progression of the OA condition.
 
The prevalence of companion animal osteoarthritis is estimated through a variety of methods. In looking at the dog osteoarthritis incidence Spencer Johnston’s article “Osteoarthritis. Joint anatomy, physiology, and pathobiology” is often cited, this article reports that 20% of all dogs over the age of one year suffer from osteoarthritis. Using this simple methodology, management has estimated that 20% of the total dog population is under age one.
 
89.7 million x 80% = 71.8 million x 20% with OA = 14.4 million dogs with OA in U.S.
 
Craig-Hallum’s July 22, 2013 institutional research report on Aratana Therapeutics estimates the U.S. dog osteoarthritis market at 16.6 million dogs. William Blair & Company, L.L.C. released a July 25, 2013 Equity Research report by Aratana Therapeutics that concluded that roughly 10% of dogs and cat suffer from osteoarthritis (89.7 million dogs x 10% = 9 million dogs with OA). Stifel issued a report on Aratana Therapeutics dated July 22, 2013 that estimated the osteoarthritis market to be 55% of dogs over the age of 10. This equates to a US market in 2014 of 7.1 million dogs with osteoarthritis.
 
Horse Osteoarthritis (Lameness)
 
Equine osteoarthritis is the most common cause of lameness in horses. The annual average costs for diagnosis and treatment of equine lameness is $3,000 per horse, with downtime & homecare costs being much higher (Oke and McIlwraith, 2010). “The USDA National Economic Cost of Equine Lameness… in the United States” published by 1978 places the annual incidence of lameness at 8.5-13.7 lameness events/100 horses.
 
As noted previously, the APPA reported the total number of horses owned by U.S. households was 7.6 million in 2018. A 2007 publication by Emily Kilby “The Demographics of the U.S. Equine Population” concludes the US horse population to be 9.5 million in 2006 with racehorses being 9% of that population or 846,000 horses. The article “The Occurrence and Causes of Lameness and Laminitis in the U.S. Horse Population” estimates that 17% of racehorses and 5.4% of the rest of the horse population go lame annually. Based on the above assumptions we calculate that there are approximately 500,000 new lame horses each year.
 
Distribution
 
Most U.S. veterinarians buy a majority of their equipment and supplies from a preferred distributor. More than 75% of veterinarians name Butler Schein Animal Health, Inc., Webster Veterinary Supply Inc. (recently acquired by Patterson), MWI, Midwest Veterinary Supply, Inc. or Victor Medical Company as their preferred distributor. Combined, these top-tier distributors sell more than 85%, by revenue, of the products sold to companion animal veterinarians in the U.S. Butler, Webster and MWI are recognized by manufacturers, distributors and veterinarians as the pre-eminent national companion animal veterinary supply distributors in the US. There are no other distributors that provide equivalent levels of service to manufacturers and regularly visit veterinarians in as wide a geographic area as Butler, Webster or MWI. Midwest and Victor are large, regional distributors, also with strong reputations for high-quality service. The above data in this paragraph was sourced from File No. 101 0023 at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

We plan to have our product distribution leverage the existing supply chain and veterinary clinic and clinician relationships already established by these large distributors. We intend to support and supplement this distribution channel with regional business development & training representatives. We plan to have our business development representatives provide product training to distribution representatives, veterinarians and other veterinary staff. In addition, we intend to have our representatives and veterinarian partners exhibit at key veterinary conferences as well as support ongoing case studies. All of these sales, distribution, marketing and education efforts will also be supported by both veterinarian and pet owner product education and treatment awareness campaigns that will be conducted utilizing a variety of digital media tools. The unique nature and the anticipated benefits provided by our initial Kush product are expected to generate significant consumer response.
 
Particle Devices
 

Orthopedic Joint Treatments A treatment for joint pain, which is made of injected, protein-based gel particles. In vivo studies indicate that the gel particle device can easily be combined with synovial fluid in a rabbit knee to form a joint cushion, buffering the adjacent bones/cartilage where no damage was caused to the cartilage from replacing the synovial fluid. The particles show an effectiveness to repair, reconstitute or remodel the tissue, cartilage, ligaments and/or bone and/or enhance the functionality of the joint (e.g. repair deteriorated components present in the joint to provide cushion or shock-absorbing features to the joint and to provide joint lubricity) AppTec Laboratories accomplished a gel-particle rabbit study. In short, New Zealand white rabbits (6) were injected in both stifle joints (knees) to fill but not extend the synovial space (~0.5 cc GDP/site). Rabbits were tested every other day for abnormal clinical signs including range of motion and joint observations until sacrifice. Behavioral testing revealed no abnormal scores for range of motion, withdrawal response, or joint observations (all animals were 100% normal). At one week and at four weeks the animals were sacrificed. AppTec pathologists evaluated knee joint histology. The reported cartilage surfaces of the femoral and tibia condyles and the menisci were grossly and histologically 100% normal for all animals and test sites. The test particles were found in all of the injection sites.

The test particle did not cause changes in the articular cartilage of the femur or tibia when injected into the stifle joint of rabbits. The test article and control rabbit knees were not different for either 1 or 4-week time points for all histological measurements. In conclusion, the particles do not cause inflammation or damage to knee joint and will stick to exposed tissues and biologically integrate with those tissues. The particles were not found to stick to articular cartilage in any sample. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regenerative Characteristics
 
The particle devices for joint injections have been extensively studied for a broad range of applications including the treatment of wrinkles as dermal filler. Here is an overview of the pre-clinical and clinical studies completed for CosmetaLife, which is the name used for the particle device when it was used as a dermal filler.

Particle Integration after 12 Weeks The image at left shows collagen in blue, fibroblasts in red and CosmetaLife in gray. Note the typical cellularization and integration of collagen within the CosmetaLife matrix perimeter. Also notice the fibroblasts (collagen producers) are integrated throughout the injection site.

CosmetaLife is an easy-to-inject, water-protein-based dermal filler that not only fills nasolabial wrinkle depressions but also helps rejuvenate the dermal tissues, counteracting damage that causes wrinkles. The dermal cells are attracted to the CosmetaLife gel-particles, attach to them, and then slowly replace them with natural dermal material (extracellular matrix). The natural biological replacement process of CosmetaLife to collagen is estimated to take 6-12 months. CosmetaLife clinical trial on nasolabial folds supports this estimate.
 
CosmetaLife injections allow the body to create more natural dermal structure in and around every particle. Enhancing the natural process of dermal tissue construction with CosmetaLife allows for long-term dermal contouring, corrections, and rejuvenation with little to no adverse side effects noted in clinical trials.

Particle Device Clinical Studies
 

The Company has conducted several biocompatibility animal studies. In the implantation study, no abnormal clinical signs were noted for any of the rabbits. The results of the sensitization study in guinea pigs showed a sensitization response equivalent to the negative controls. The results of the histological report on the rabbit skin biopsies clearly demonstrate structural integration of the particles into the host tissues by week 12. Evaluators observed the particle material integration with normal tissue, remodeled and/or new collagen, and fibroblasts throughout the injected particles, mild to no inflammation, and new collagen-matrix production.

A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) IDE approved pivotal human clinical trial began with CosmetaLife late in 2006. The clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, parallel assignment, multi-center comparison of the safety and efficacy of CosmetaLife versus Restylane® (Control) for the correction of nasolabial folds. One hundred seventy-one patients were skin tested and 145 were treated at six trial sites. The number of study exits after treatment totaled four subjects. This clinical trial was reported and published at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00414544).
 
The feedback from physician investigators has been positive with respect to CosmetaLife injection qualities, cosmetic appearance, and its feel to the touch. During the first three to four months of the study, CosmetaLife showed no decrease in efficacy, as compared to Restylane that showed an 11 percent decrease in efficacy. The FDA/IDE approved human clinical trial for the CosmetaLife product through twelve months was found to be the same as compared to control hyaluronic acid product, Restylane (for each interval the consensus of the blinded subjects tested preferred CosmetaLife or showed no preference at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months).
 

CosmetaLife particles, shown in figure to the left, were photographed from a light microscope under high magnification and immersed in a saline solution to help disperse them for better viewing. These particles are approximately 100 microns in size (0.1 mm in diameter).

We use existing, scalable processes to reduce the infrastructure requirements and manufacturing risks to deliver a consistent, high-quality product while being responsive to volume requirements. We are working to scale the manufacturing process, to date making batches in up to 2.0-kilogram quantities to near GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) standards.
 
Particles Safety Study
 
Patients injected with CosmetaLife were found to have no or mild inflammatory, irritation, or immunogenic responses. These results suggest the particles are biocompatible because it closely matches the skin structure, composition, and moisture content. The no-to-low immunogenic responses are attributed to the tight cross-linking of the CosmetaLife matrix, which prevents immunogenic progenitor cells from producing antibodies to the matrix.

In the clinical trial, the incidence of possible reaction to a skin test was 2.55 percent, with only one subject showing a reaction to a second test or 0.6%, (1 out of 171). We also have a study report by AppTec, Inc., our Contract Research Organization, that [CosmetaLife] did not produce an antibody response during the clinical trial further supporting our belief that it is safe to use. CosmetaLife is composed of materials that approximately meet the Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) requirements of the FDA. CosmetaLife contains materials from certified bovine and porcine tissue sources that do not harbor prion disease or BSE. Additionally, steps in the manufacturing process have been validated for deactivating all viruses.

Extrusion force testing and the Clinical Trial usage both demonstrate the consistent and easy injection of CosmetaLife. Twenty-five month stability testing shows that CosmetaLife is stable at room temperature conditions. Moreover, CosmetaLife has been shown to be stable at 40 °C (104 °F) conditions for at least 3 months.
 
Competition
 
The development and commercialization of new animal health medicines is highly competitive, and we expect considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty animal health medicines companies. As a result, there are, and likely will continue to be, extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new animal health medicines. Our potential competitors include large animal health companies, such as Zoetis, Inc.; Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc.; Merial, the animal health division of Sanofi S.A.; Elanco, the animal health division of Eli Lilly and Company; Bayer Animal Health, the animal health division of Bayer AG; NAH, the animal health division of Novartis AG; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Virbac Group; Ceva Animal Health; Vetoquinol and Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC. We are also aware of several smaller early stage animal health companies, such as Kindred Bio, Aratana Therapeutics Inc. (recently acquired by Elanco), NextVet and VetDC that are developing products for use in the pet therapeutics market.
Regulation – Human and Veterinary Use
 
A number of the medical devices that we manufacture for veterinary applications, and plan to manufacture for human applications, are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Medical devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device receives approval for commercial distribution.
 
In the EU, medical devices are required to comply with the Medical Devices Directive and obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark certification, granted following approval from an independent Notified Body, is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable European Medical Devices Directives. Distributors of medical devices may also be required to comply with other foreign regulations such as Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare approval in Japan. The time required to obtain these foreign approvals to market our products may be longer or shorter than that required in the U.S., and requirements for those approvals may differ from those required by the FDA. In Europe, our devices are classified as Class IIa or IIb, and will need to conform to the Medical Devices Directive.

In the U.S., specific permission from the FDA to distribute a new device is usually required (that is, other than in the case of very low risk devices), and we expect that some form of marketing authorization will be necessary for our devices. Marketing authorization is generally sought and obtained in one of two ways. The first process requires that a pre-market notification (510(k) Submission) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or “substantially equivalent” to, a legally-marketed device that is not subject to pre-market approval (“PMA”). A legally-marketed device is a device that (i) was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, (ii) has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or (iii) has been found to be substantially equivalent to another legally-marketed device following a 510(k) Submission. The legally-marketed device to which equivalence is drawn is known as the “predicate” device. Applicants must submit descriptive data and, when necessary, performance data to establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. In some instances, data from human clinical studies must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) Submission. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms with specific requirements in accordance with federal regulations including the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) and human subjects protections or “Good Clinical Practice” regulations. After the 510(k) application is submitted, the applicant cannot market the device unless FDA issues “510(k) clearance” deeming the device substantially equivalent. After an applicant has obtained clearance, the changes to existing devices covered by a 510(k) Submission which do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness can generally be made without additional 510(k) Submissions, but evaluation of whether a new 510(k) is needed is a complex regulatory issue, and changes must be evaluated on an ongoing basis to determine whether a proposed change triggers the need for a new 510(k), or even PMA. The 510(k) clearance pathway is not available for all devices: whether it is a suitable path to market depends on several factors, including regulatory classifications, the intended use of the device, and technical and risk-related issues for the device.
 
The second, more rigorous, process requires that an application for PMA be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use as manufactured. This approval process applies to most Class III devices. A PMA submission includes data regarding design, materials, bench and animal testing, and human clinical data for the medical device. Again, clinical trials are subject to extensive FDA regulation. Following completion of clinical trials and submission of a PMA, the FDA will authorize commercial distribution if it determines there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe and effective for its intended purpose. This determination is based on the benefit outweighing the risk for the population intended to be treated with the device. This process is much more detailed, time-consuming, and expensive than the 510(k) process. Also, FDA may impose a variety of conditions on the approval of a PMA.
 
Both before and after a device for the U.S. market is commercially released, we would have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We would also be subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the FDA and other U.S. regulatory bodies (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and various state Attorneys General) monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our products. Although physicians are permitted to use their medical judgment to employ medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we are prohibited from promoting products for such “off-label” uses and can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, including a hold on approving new devices until issues are resolved to its satisfaction, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the DOJ. Conduct giving rise to civil or criminal penalties may also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by our conduct.
 
The delivery of our devices in the U.S. market would be subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and comparable state agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care.

Federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally-funded health care programs. The principal federal laws include: (1) the False Claims Act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally-funded health care program; (2) the Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of inducing or rewarding referrals of items or services reimbursable by a Federal health care program; (3) the Stark law which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician’s immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider; and (4) health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payer. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self referral and insurance laws that apply to state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs and private third-party payers. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act can be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the U.S. if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country.
 
The laws applicable to us are subject to change, and subject to evolving interpretations. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including substantial fines and damages, and exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid.
 
The process of obtaining clearance to market products is costly and time-consuming in virtually all of the major markets in which we expect to sell products and may delay the marketing and sale of our products. Countries around the world have recently adopted more stringent regulatory requirements, which are expected to add to the delays and uncertainties associated with new product releases, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those releases. No assurance can be given that any of our other medical devices will be approved on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Pertaining to our Kush device (offered for veterinary use only), in the U.S., the FDA does not require submission of a 510(k), PMA, or any pre-market approval for devices used in veterinary medicine. Device manufacturers who exclusively manufacture or distribute veterinary devices are not required to register their establishments and list veterinary devices and are exempt from post-marketing reporting. The FDA does have regulatory oversight over veterinary devices and can take appropriate regulatory action if a veterinary device is misbranded or adulterated. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer and/or distributor of these articles to assure that these animal devices are safe, effective, and properly labeled.
 
Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated. Frequently, medical device companies may choose to seek and obtain regulatory approval of a device in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. given the differing regulatory requirements. However, this does not ensure approval of a device in the U.S.
