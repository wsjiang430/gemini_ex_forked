Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Our pipeline candidates are built on our deep expertise in myeloid biology and cancer drug development, uniting the targeting precision of antibodies with the power of the innate and adaptive immune system to reprogram the tumor microenvironment for a productive anti-cancer response. Our proprietary Boltbody ISAC (immune-stimulating antibody conjugate) platform technology combines tumor-targeting antibodies with immune-stimulating linker payloads to create productive anti-tumor immune responses. We believe this approach has the potential to create products that work with a patient’s own immune system, resulting in anti-cancer efficacy with very good tolerability. Having explored hundreds of linker-payloads and dozens of different tumor targets, we know the importance of both the linker payload and the antibody and have developed a library of linker payloads we can use in our own development and in our collaborations.
 Our first Boltbody ISAC is our BDC-1001 program, targeting a tumor antigen known as HER2. BDC-1001 recently completed a dose-escalation trial and is advancing into multiple Phase 2 clinical trials. Our expertise in myeloid cell biology also forms the foundation for additional, innovative immuno-oncology approaches that complement our Boltbody ISAC platform. A prime example is BDC-3042, our Dectin-2 agonist antibody program. BDC-3042 is being developed to repolarize critical cells in the tumor microenvironment known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) by targeting cell-surface receptors. Dectin-2 agonism results in these TAMs changing away from the M2 phenotype that suppresses immune responses and supports tumor growth to the tumor-destructive M1 phenotype.
 Our Boltbody ISACs are delivered systemically but act locally through a highly targeted approach that triggers a localized anti-tumor immune cascade through a “Three-Factor Authentication” process. This process is designed to optimize safety and minimize adverse, non-tumor-targeted systemic immune stimulation as follows:
1.Tumor antigen recognition: Our selective and specific Boltbody ISACs bind specifically to the target antigen, recognizing tumors that express the target antigen. 
 2.Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP): Engagement of active Fc domains triggers myeloid-mediated phagocytosis of the Boltbody ISAC-bound tumor cell. This process directly kills antigen-expressing tumor cells and delivers tumor neoantigens to myeloid cells. 
 3.TLR-mediated activation: Our proprietary TLR agonists are designed to be cell impermeable and are conjugated to antibodies with stable, non-cleavable linkers. Because TLR 7 and 8 receptors are intracellular, stimulation only occurs in myeloid cells that have phagocytosed the tumor cells that are coated with the Boltbody ISAC. The stimulated myeloid cells secrete cytokines to lower the activation threshold and chemokines to attract more immune cells into the tumor microenvironment. 
 Myeloid cells engulf the Boltbody ISAC-bound tumor cells, become armed with tumor neoantigens, and migrate to the lymph nodes. At the lymph nodes, these myeloid cells mediate the activation and rapid expansion of tumor-reactive T cells to eliminate tumor cells, including those without the initial target antigen. As a result, the immune system determines which neoantigens are most important to eliminate the target tumors. We believe that this represents the development of systemic immunological memory with epitope spreading to neoantigens that will result in long-term anti-tumor responses.
The Boltbody ISAC platform has the following unique features that offer potential benefits for patients:
•Ability to address difficult-to-treat solid tumors including those refractory to current treatments;
 •Designed to be well tolerated by avoiding unintended systemic immune stimulation; 
 •Generation of immunological memory with epitope spreading to provide long-term anti-tumor responses and protect against recurrence; and 
 •Potential to help patients who have a defective adaptive immune response. 

Our Pipeline
We are leveraging our myeloid biology expertise to build a robust pipeline of immuno-oncology product candidates, including multiple Boltbody ISACs and a unique agonist antibody that targets tumor-associated macrophages as shown in the figure below. In addition to these programs, we are exploring various well-known targets that have been traditionally difficult to drug and where our myeloid expertise and the Boltbody ISAC approach may unlock the potential of these promising antigens as viable cancer targets. We currently hold exclusive worldwide rights to all of our proprietary development programs.

   In this graphic, HER2 = human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; * Previously treated with Enhertu;  Collaboration using Bristol-Myers Squibb’s PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab; § Collaboration using Roche’s HER2 antagonist pertuzumab 
Our lead product candidate, BDC-1001, is currently in clinical development for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive solid tumors, including breast, colorectal, endometrial, and gastroesophageal cancer. We have two clinical collaboration and supply agreements to study BDC-1001 in combinations, one with Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for nivolumab, a leading PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, and one with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, or Roche, for pertuzumab, a HER2-targeting monoclonal antibody. HER2, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, is also known as ERBB2 and is expressed in a wide range of tumors beyond the four mentioned above. BDC-1001 is a Boltbody ISAC comprising the HER2-targeting biosimilar trastuzumab conjugated to one of our proprietary TLR7/8 agonists to maximize the potential anti-tumor response. Preliminary clinical data demonstrate that BDC-1001 is well tolerated at dose levels up to 20 mg/kg administered every week and leads to changes in key biomarkers in the tumor and plasma consistent with our proposed mechanism of action. Monotherapy activity has been seen in the form of partial responses and long-term disease stabilization across several different HER2-expressing tumors, and we have also seen partial responses and stable disease in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab. We have completed BDC-1001’s dose-escalation study and selected a recommended Phase 2 dose, both in monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. A Phase 2 study exploring efficacy in HER2-positive colorectal, endometrial, and gastroesophageal cancers, is expected to commence in 2023. This study is designed to explore combination with nivolumab only after demonstration of monotherapy activity. A second 2-arm Phase 2 study will compare BDC-1001 monotherapy to the combination of BDC-1001 and pertuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer.

Our second program, BDC-3042, is an agonist antibody targeting Dectin-2, an innate immune receptor found on the surface of macrophages. Dectin-2 is selectively expressed in TAMs across a broad range of tumor types, including head and neck, non-small cell lung, ovarian, and triple-negative breast cancer, among others. We have demonstrated that stimulation with our agonist antibody has anti-tumor activity in mouse models. We have developed a lead agonist antibody that binds to Dectin-2 and activates human TAMs. Activated TAMs start to produce TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, and CCL3. We are completing Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, -enabling activities for BDC-3042 and we expect to commence a clinical trial later in 2023.
Our third program is a proprietary next-generation ISAC program against an undisclosed target. We expect to designate a clinical candidate by the end of 2023.
We entered into our first collaboration in March 2019 with Toray Industries, Inc., or Toray, to jointly develop and commercialize a Boltbody ISAC utilizing a Toray proprietary antibody. In May 2021, we entered into an oncology research and development collaboration with Genmab A/S, or Genmab, to evaluate Genmab antibodies and bispecific antibody engineering technologies in combination with our proprietary Boltbody ISAC technology platform, with the goal of discovering and developing next-generation bispecific ISACs for the treatment of cancer. In August 2021, we entered into an oncology research and development collaboration with Innovent Biologics, Inc., or Innovent, to leverage Innovent’s proprietary therapeutic antibody portfolio and antibody discovery capability against undisclosed oncology targets in combination with our advanced ISAC technology and myeloid biology expertise to create new candidates for cancer treatments. We expect our collaborations with Toray, Genmab, and Innovent to add additional novel ISACs to our pipeline.
 Our Corporate History and Team
Our company was founded in 2015 to develop and commercialize pioneering work from the Engleman Laboratory at Stanford University. We have assembled a highly qualified management team with broad experience in myeloid biology, and drug discovery and development to execute our mission. Our scientific founders and management team collectively have extensive experience in immunology, oncology drug development, and patient care. We are industry veterans with prior experience at companies such as Alder, Astellas, Jazz, Roche / Genentech, Sunesis and others. Together, our team has a proven track record in the discovery, development, and commercialization of numerous approved therapeutics such as Alecensa, Cytovene, Evenity, Gazyva, Herceptin, Kadcyla, Polivy, Perjeta, Rituxan, Tecentriq, Valcyte, Venclexta, and Vyepti while at other companies.
Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading immuno-oncology company, leveraging our myeloid biology expertise and proprietary Boltbody ISAC approach to discover, develop and commercialize transformative treatments to address key unmet medical needs in cancer. The key components of our strategy are to:
•Leverage our Boltbody ISAC approach and myeloid expertise to develop our pipeline of immune-activating therapies. Our expertise in myeloid biology and immuno-oncology has led us to research various tumor antigens across solid tumors where significant unmet medical needs remain. Our expertise in medicinal chemistry and antibody engineering and our ability to modulate TLR linker-payloads allow us to optimize the therapeutic profile of our product candidates for any tumor antigen as part of our research and discovery efforts to produce durable anti-tumor responses. We believe that our approach is applicable to a broad spectrum of tumor-associated antigens expressed on cancers, including cancers that are refractory to existing therapies. 
 •Rapidly advance the development of our lead Boltbody ISAC product candidate, BDC-1001, for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive cancers. BDC-1001 is currently entering Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of patients with certain HER2-positive solid tumors. Based on promising preclinical and early clinical activity, we believe BDC-1001 has the potential to be effective both as a monotherapy and in combination with existing therapies for patients with HER2-positive solid tumors. While currently approved HER2-targeting agents are important and effective treatment options for some patients with HER2-positive solid tumors, many patients do not respond to these therapies, develop tumor progression after initial response or are not eligible for current HER2-targeting therapies. These sizable patient populations do not have adequate treatment options. Therefore, we intend to rapidly advance development of BDC-1001 across multiple HER2-positive cancers, including in breast, colorectal, endometrial, and gastroesophageal cancers. 


•Expeditiously advance our pipeline focused on Dectin-2, another promising target. Our pipeline includes BDC-3042, an antibody targeting Dectin-2, which represents ab additional opportunity to demonstrate our expertise in myeloid biology. BDC-3042 targets macrophages in the tumor microenvironment to initiate robust innate and adaptive immune responses. We believe that this differentiated approach could improve the lives of patients by producing durable anti-tumor responses. We expect BDC-3042 to enter the clinic in 2023. 
 •Continue to invest in our myeloid expertise and Boltbody ISAC approach to explore the full potential of our targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Our expertise, rigor, and unbiased data-driven approach may lead to additional research and discovery programs that are complementary or independent of our Boltbody ISAC approach and our growing library of innate immune stimulators. 
 •Selectively enter into collaborations to expand and enhance our proprietary Boltbody ISAC approach and myeloid expertise and increase the impact of our product candidates. In order to advance treatment options for patients, we may selectively collaborate with other companies with complementary technology or resources that could maximize the value of our product candidates and expand our pipeline. Such collaborations may provide us with novel technologies, targets, agents or approaches that complement our myeloid expertise and innovative Boltbody ISAC approach to improve the lives of patients with cancer. Collaborations can also provide significant funding for our research activities. Our collaborations with Genmab, Innovent, and Toray are all examples of this approach. 
 BDC-1001
Overview
Our lead product candidate, BDC-1001, is currently in clinical development for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive solid tumors. BDC-1001 provides a compelling example of the potential of Boltbody ISACs to address unmet medical needs in solid tumors. BDC-1001 is delivered systemically and acts locally by targeting HER2-expressing tumors and related metastatic disease, triggering their destruction by the innate and adaptive immune systems. BDC-1001 consists of a biosimilar of the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab that is chemically conjugated to one of our proprietary TLR7/8 agonists via a non-cleavable linker.
Preclinical Data
We have conducted extensive in vitro and in vivo experiments over the course of developing BDC-1001. Detailed results can be reviewed in our posters and publications, including Ackerman SE, et al. Nature Cancer. 2021; 2:18-33. Key findings from our preclinical studies include:
 •An intact, active Boltbody ISAC targeting an antigen on tumors is required for full effect. If any component of three-factor authentication is missing or if the ISAC components are administered together without conjugation, it will not work. This includes several models where a HER2 antibody alone does not work, but a HER2 ISAC does. 
 •Using a cell impermeable linker-payload conjugated with a stable, non-cleavable linker minimizes safety concerns.
 •Changes in biomarker activity are concentrated in the tumor, with levels of cytokines and chemokines in the tumor generally ranging from 3-10 times the levels seen in the plasma. 
 •An increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and an increase in immune cell infiltrate into the tumor, starts to be seen prior to anti-tumor activity.
 •Optimal activity requires an average trough serum concentration (Cmin) of approximately 10-20 µg/ml across various models, corresponding to a receptor occupancy of greater than 60%. 
 •Once established, the BDC-1001 anti-tumor response will reject rechallenge from the same tumor cell line, even when the HER2 target antigen is no longer present. This demonstrates epitope spreading and durable immune protection. 
 •Combining the HER2-targeting antibody pertuzumab with BDC-1001 improves efficacy in three ways:
 oEnhances the anti-tumor activity of BDC-1001.
 oEnables BDC-1001 anti-tumor activity at lower doses.
 oProduces anti-tumor activity against tumors with lower HER expression.


Overview of HER2 Indications and Treatment Paradigms
HER2 is a proto-oncogene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in signal transduction pathways that promote cell growth and differentiation. HER2 protein overexpression and gene amplification have been documented across multiple cancers, including breast, gastric, bladder, lung, esophageal, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, salivary gland, pancreatic, cervical, and other cancers. Prevalence of HER2-overexpressing or -amplified tumors varies across indications. Targeting HER2 with antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy has had a major impact on patients with HER2-positive breast and gastric cancer, but there remains a significant unmet medical need on an individual and global patient basis. Our BDC-1001 program seeks to improve therapeutic outcomes for patients with HER2-positive tumors starting with four tumor types: 1) HER2-positive breast cancer refractory to Enhertu, 2) HER2-positive gastroesophageal cancer refractory to existing anti-HER2 therapies, 3) HER2-positive colorectal cancer refractory to existing anti-HER2 therapies, and 4) HER2-positive endometrial cancer refractory to approved therapies. In addition, we have interest in potentially exploring other tumor types, such as cases with HER2-low expression, in both monotherapy and various combination strategies. Our plans also envision trials in earlier stages of cancer, such as the neoadjuvant, post-neoadjuvant, and adjuvant settings.
 HER2-targeting agents have been approved for patients with HER2-positive breast, gastric, and colorectal cancers, with HER2-positivity based on protein overexpression or gene amplification. Trastuzumab and fam-trastuzumab-deruxtecan-nxki are approved for both HER2-positive breast and gastric cancer; tucatinib is approved for HER2-positive breast and colorectal cancer. Additional approved HER2-targeting agents for HER2-positive breast cancer include the following: pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine, trastuzumab-hyaluronidase-oysk, lapatinib, neratinib, margetuximab, and tucatinib. There are no approved HER2 therapies for HER2-positive endometrial cancer.
According to Globe Life Sciences research, the 2022 annual incidence of patients with breast cancer in the United States and in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK (formerly known as the “EU5”) was estimated to be approximately 589,560 patients in the aggregate. Of these, approximately 93,530 patients had tumors that were HER2-positive. In addition, the 2022 annual incidence of patients with colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer and gastroesophageal cancer was estimated to be 408,209, 106,188 and 74,875, respectively. Of these, approximately 14,696, 37,166 and 17,670 patients, respectively, had tumors that were HER2-positive.
Clinical Development Overview
We are currently conducting a four-part, Phase 1/2 multiple ascending dose and dose-expansion trial of BDC-1001 administered as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab, a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. We have completed Part 1, the monotherapy dose-escalation, and Part 2, the nivolumab combination dose-escalation. This trial is evaluating safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary anti-tumor activity in patients with HER2-expressing solid tumors. All patients in our study have metastatic disease and disease progression after multiple prior therapies. We are now proceeding with Part 3, a monotherapy Phase 2 to evaluate safety and anti-tumor activity in HER2-positive colorectal, endometrial, and gastroesophageal tumors.
Monotherapy
•Part 1: Monotherapy dose-escalation to evaluate safety and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D. 
 •Part 3: Monotherapy dose expansion to evaluate safety and preliminary responses in HER2-positive colorectal, endometrial, and gastroesophageal tumors.
 Combination with Checkpoint Inhibitor
•Part 2: Combination dose-escalation with nivolumab (PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor) to evaluate safety and determine the RP2D of BDC-1001 in combination with nivolumab. 
 •Part 4: Combination therapy with nivolumab to evaluate safety and preliminary responses in predefined tumor types. Part 4 will proceed only after demonstrating anti-tumor activity in Part 3.
 We are also initiating a two-cohort Phase 2 trial evaluating BDC-1001 administered as a single agent or in combination with pertuzumab, a HER2-targeting monoclonal antibody. This trial will evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. All patients in this study must have disease progression after treatment with Enhertu.
Preliminary Results
We presented topline results from the dose escalation in March 2023, and plan to present data at an upcoming medical meeting. BDC-1001 was well tolerated at all doses tested, through the highest dose of 20 mg/kg weekly, and produced anti-tumor activity, including multiple partial responses, across a diverse set of solid tumor types. The dose-escalation trial enrolled more than 100 patients with 16 different types of HER2-expressing solid tumors. All patients enrolled in the study had evidence of tumor progression after standard of care, and a majority of the patients were heavily pre-treated. We saw promising signs of clinical activity as a single agent and in combination with nivolumab. We have selected a RP2D and are proceeding with Phase 2 clinical trials.
 Our prior interim data update was made at the ESMO Immuno-oncology Congress in December 2021. As of October 6, 2021, we had enrolled 57 subjects across nine cohorts at escalating levels of drug exposure, through 12 mg/kg administered every two weeks. The 57 subjects had a median of four prior anti-cancer treatments, with 79% having received a prior anti-HER2 therapy. We hda seen more than a dozen different HER2-expressing tumor types in the trial, and clinical activity has been observed in 8 different tumor types. The initial drug half-life for BDC-1001 was approximately 3.5 days. This implied the need for administration every two weeks or every week to achieve the targeted drug concentration, so we expanded the trial to include a total of 18 different dose cohorts, dosing as high as 20 mg/kg weekly. Elevations in pharmacodynamic markers such as plasma cytokines and chemokines were observed, including increases in plasma levels of IP-10, MIP1β, TNFα and IL-6, and some paired tumor biopsies displayed an increase in immune cell infiltration after BDC-1001 administration. Early signs of clinical disease control with BDC-1001 included stable disease or a partial response in 13 out of 40 evaluable subjects.
 BDC-3042
In addition to the Boltbody ISAC platform, our expertise in myeloid biology and immuno-oncology led us to discover Dectin-2 as a novel target expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We have demonstrated that agonism of Dectin-2 with the natural ligand mediates tumor regression in syngeneic mouse models, and that this effect disappears when Dectin-2 is blocked. Dectin-2 agonism causes TAMs to increase production of cytokines and chemokines such as TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, and CCL3.
Dectin-2 is selectively expressed in TAMs across a broad range of tumor types, including head and neck, non-small cell lung, ovarian, and triple-negative breast cancer, among others. Most of these TAMs belong to the immunosuppressive phenotype known as “M2” macrophages, and agonism of Dectin-2 mediates pro-inflammatory cytokine production, enhanced phagocytosis, and antigen processing and presentation. A Dectin-2 agonist antibody has the potential to convert an "M2" TAM into a tumor-destructive “M1” macrophage to elicit a productive anti-tumor immune response. Anti-PD-1 therapy has been shown to differentially upregulate expression of Dectin-2 within tumors, which provides an interesting rationale for exploring this combination.
 We discovered a number of potent agonist antibodies targeting Dectin-2 and lead optimization resulted in a lead candidate with an engineered Fc domain which we are developing. Our preclinical work has demonstrated that this antibody can potently activate human macrophages, eliciting production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, and CCL3. In ex-vivo experiments, we also demonstrated induction of significant cytokines and chemokines from primary human tumor samples which included a mix of tumor cells and immune cell infiltrate. We have also demonstrated that stimulation with our agonist antibody has better anti-tumor activity than pembrolizumab in humanized mice bearing MDA-MB-231 tumors, which endogenously express PD-L1.
 We are currently completing IND-enabling activities and we expect to submit an IND and initiate clinical development in 2023.


Collaboration Agreements
Joint Development and License Agreement with Toray Industries
In March 2019, we entered into a Joint Development and License Agreement, or the Toray Agreement, with Toray, to develop and commercialize a Boltbody ISAC containing a proprietary antibody owned by Toray. Under the Toray Agreement, we exchanged co-exclusive (with each other) licenses to certain patents and know-how covering our respective technologies. Each party is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct development and regulatory activities assigned to it under a development plan. Toray will be solely responsible for both parties’ development costs up to the conclusion of the first Phase 1 clinical trial and Toray is entitled to reimbursement for 50% of such development costs from our share of revenues collected from the sale or licensing of collaboration products. After the conclusion of the first Phase 1 clinical trial, the parties will share equally all costs of development activities necessary for obtaining regulatory approval of collaboration products in the indications in the territories covered under the agreement, unless either party elects to opt out of its co-funding obligations or reduce them by half, which election can be on a region-by-region basis. The research plan and program development continues to be reevaluated by both parties and the outcome of this reevaluation may impact the scope and timing of the collaboration.
Oncology Research and Development Collaboration with Genmab A/S
In May 2021, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Genmab Agreement, with Genmab. Together, the companies will evaluate Genmab antibodies and bispecific antibody technologies in combination with our Boltbody ISAC technology platform, with the goal of discovering and developing next-generation bispecific ISACs for the treatment of cancer. Under this research collaboration, the companies will evaluate multiple bispecific ISAC concepts to identify up to three clinical candidates for development. Genmab will fund the research, along with the preclinical and clinical development of these candidates through initial clinical proof of concept.

Innovent will fund the initial research, along with the preclinical and clinical development of these candidates through initial clinical proof of concept. Under the Innovent Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $5.0 million. Under the Innovent Agreement, we will be compensated for research and development services at the agreed upon full-time employee rate and third-party costs through initial clinical proof of concept of the therapeutic candidates, after which both parties can exercise their respective license rights. The Innovent Agreement includes license options exercisable by each party to exclusively develop, manufacture and commercialize each candidate in a specific territory. With respect to each candidate for which a party has exercised its license option, the other party is eligible to receive a license option exercise fee, potential development and sales-based milestone payments and tiered royalties.
Oncology Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb
 In September 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration and supply agreement, or the BMS Agreement, with BMS to study BDC-1001 in combination with BMS’s PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab, for the treatment of HER2-expressing solid tumors. Under the BMS Agreement, BMS granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license (with a right to sublicense) under its intellectual property to use nivolumab in a clinical trial for a combination therapy of nivolumab and our proprietary compound, BDC-1001, and has agreed to supply nivolumab at no cost to us and we will sponsor, fund and conduct the initial Phase 1/2 clinical trial in accordance with an agreed-upon protocol. Both parties will own the study data produced in the clinical trial, other than study data related solely to nivolumab, which will belong solely to BMS, or study data related solely to BDC-1001, which will belong solely to us. The parties may conduct additional clinical trials on

the combined therapy which may be sponsored and funded by one party, or jointly funded. We initiated the clinical trial evaluating the combination of nivolumab and BDC-1001 in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Clinical Supply Agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
 In September 2022, we entered into a clinical supply agreement, or the Roche Agreement, with Roche to study BDC-1001 in combination with Roche’s pertuzumab (Perjeta®), a compound approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Under the Roche Agreement, Roche granted us a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license under its intellectual property to use pertuzumab in a clinical trial for a combination therapy of pertuzumab and our proprietary compound, BDC-1001, and has agreed to supply pertuzumab at no cost to us and we will sponsor, fund and conduct the initial Phase 2 clinical trial in accordance with an agreed-upon protocol. Both parties will own the study data produced in the clinical trial, other than study data related solely to pertuzumab, which will belong solely to Roche, or study data related solely to BDC-1001, which will belong solely to us. The parties may conduct additional clinical trials on the combined therapy which may be sponsored and funded by one party, or jointly funded. We expect to initiate the clinical trial evaluating the combination of pertuzumab and BDC-1001 in 2023.
License Agreements
License Agreements with Stanford University
In May 2015 and June 2018, we entered into license agreements, or the Stanford Agreement, as amended, with The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford. The Stanford Agreement provides us exclusive licenses to certain patents related to our proprietary Boltbody ISAC technology and related to Dectin-2, to develop, manufacture, and commercialize licensed products incorporating such technology. Stanford retained the right under the Stanford Agreement, on behalf of itself and certain of its affiliates, and all other non-profit research institutions, to practice the licensed patents for any non-profit purpose, including sponsored research and collaborations, but excluding delivery of paid or reimbursed healthcare. However, Stanford retained the right to practice the licensed patents for the delivery of its own paid or reimbursed healthcare. The licensed patents related to Dectin-2 are additionally subject to a nonexclusive, worldwide license held by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to exercise such intellectual property rights for research purposes, with the right to sublicense to non-profit and governmental entities.
The technology claimed by some of the patents licensed under both Stanford Agreements was developed using U.S. government funding and those licenses are therefore subject to a nonexclusive license held by the U.S. government, certain requirements that licensed products be manufactured in the United States (unless waived according to U.S. government process) and U.S. government march-in rights. For more information on risks related to technology developed using government funding see “Risk Factors–Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Under each Stanford Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products and we are also required to achieve certain development and/or regulatory milestones by certain dates, which can be extended a limited number of times upon the payment of a nominal fee. The Stanford Agreements continue until terminated. We may terminate either of the Stanford Agreements at any time for any reason by providing at least 30 days’ written notice to Stanford. Stanford may terminate either of the Stanford Agreements if we breach certain provisions of such Stanford Agreement, including the payment and development and/or regulatory milestone obligations, and fail to remedy such breach within 60 days after written notice of such breach by Stanford.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely on third-party CMOs for production and testing of our clinical material, including the linker-payloads and antibodies used to make our Boltbody ISACs, and we expect to continue to do so to meet our toxicology, clinical, and commercial activities. We believe there are multiple sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates.
Manufacturing Agreement with Piramal
In June 2018, we entered into a master services agreement with Piramal pursuant to which Piramal provides development and cGMP manufacturing services to us on a non-exclusive basis, with initial statements of work covering our BDC-1001 drug substance and drug product. The agreement has an initial term of five years and will continue for consecutive one-year renewal terms unless terminated by either party upon written notice to the other party prior to the end of the then current term. We may terminate the agreement or any statement of work upon prior written notice to Piramal and may be required to

pay cancellation fees if we cancel scheduled cGMP manufacturing slots without sufficient advance notice prior to the planned start date. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach.
Supply Agreement with EirGenix
In January 2022, we entered into an amended and restated supply agreement with EirGenix, Inc., or the Amended Supply Agreement, which amends the original supply agreement with EirGenix, Inc., or EirGenix, dated March 10, 2019, pursuant to which EirGenix agreed to supply to us, on a non-exclusive basis, bulk drug substance of EG12014, its monoclonal antibody being developed as a biosimilar of trastuzumab, which we use in the manufacture of BDC-1001. In addition, EirGenix provides us access to its regulatory data package and services to facilitate our development and commercialization efforts and we are required to make milestone payments to EirGenix up to an aggregate of $2.0 million based upon achievement of certain BDC-1001 regulatory milestones and pay for services based upon time and materials. The agreement will remain in effect as long as we, or any of our affiliates or licensees, continue to pursue the development or commercialization of any HER2 Boltbody ISAC, unless earlier terminated. We may terminate the agreement if EirGenix fails to supply sufficient quantities of EG12014 or if EirGenix does not obtain regulatory approval for EG12014 as a standalone biosimilar product. We may also terminate the EirGenix Agreement upon prior written notice to EirGenix. EirGenix may terminate the agreement if we do not actively develop a HER2 Boltbody ISAC for more than two years. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the immuno-oncology subsector, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, fierce competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs and defense of intellectual property. We face potential competition from many sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, public and private research institutions, and governmental agencies. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that are in development and may become available in the future.
Oncology therapeutics on the market and in development range from traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, to new therapies that harness the body’s own immune system to fight cancer. A significant part of the immune response to cancer involves myeloid cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, monocytes and granulocytes, all of which dynamically regulate tumor growth and progression. There are several therapies targeting myeloid cells on the market or in development. We view companies developing ISACs, especially ISACs with TLR7 agonist, TLR8 agonist or dual TLR7/8 agonist payloads, as the closest competitors for our lead program, BDC-1001. Currently the only other ISAC in active clinical development is Mersana Therapeutics’ XMT-2056, which uses a STING agonist payload. In January 2023, Mersana’s XMT-2056 started a Phase 1 trial in subjects with HER2-expressing breast, gastric, colorectal and non-small-cell lung cancers, and the trial was placed on clinical hold in March 2023. We do not consider any company developing unconjugated TLR agonists or unconjugated STING agonists to be direct competitors given that our Boltbody ISAC approach has demonstrated greater effectiveness with differentiated biology and a favorable safety profile as compared to unconjugated TLR or STING agonists that are typically administered intratumorally or have significant toxicities when administered systemically.
We are initially developing BDC-1001 for the treatment of HER2-positive cancers. HER2 is a well-known and validated oncology target and there are marketed therapies and others in development addressing this target. Marketed therapies include Roche’s Herceptin, Perjeta, Kadcyla and Phesgo (fixed-dose combination of Herceptin/Perjeta), Novartis’ Tykerb, Puma Biotechnology’s Nerlynx, Seagen’s Tukysa, MacroGenics’ Margenza, as well as Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s Enhertu. We are aware of several therapies in development for patients with HER2-positive tumors including Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Zymework’s zanidatamab and Zymework’s ZW49, Seagen and RemeGen’s disitamab vedotin, Byondis’ trastuzumab duocarmazine (also known as SYD985) Merus’ MCLA-128, and Ambrx’s ARX788.
Many of our potential competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical, and clinical development, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved drugs than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

Our success is contingent in part upon the successful development and commercialization of BDC-1001 and our other pipeline candidates that prove to be more effective or safer than competing products in our target indications. We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than BDC-1001 or any other drug that we may develop. Our competitors also may be more successful than us in obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or other regulatory approvals for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for BDC-1001 or our other drugs, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect intellectual property and other proprietary rights for our current and future product candidates, and our Boltbody ISAC approach through a variety of methods, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our Boltbody ISAC approach, our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how, to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or violating our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Regardless of the coverage we seek under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the product or process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued and courts can reinterpret patent scope after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the United States, permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any current or future issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property. For this and other risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, Boltbody ISAC approach and product candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors–Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 As of December 31, 2022, we have three issued U.S. patents that we co-own with Stanford and for which Stanford has exclusively licensed their rights to us under the 2015 Stanford Agreement. The issued U.S. patents contain claims to our lead product candidate BDC-1001 and will expire between 2037 and 2040. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we own, co-own with Stanford or exclusively license from Stanford approximately 192 pending patent applications in various countries (29 of which are pending in the U.S., and ten of which are Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") applications that have yet to enter the national phase in the U.S.).
We have 21 pending patent applications, including three pending U.S. nonprovisional patent applications and 18 pending foreign patent applications, which contain claims to our lead product candidate BDC-1001 and which we co-own with Stanford and for which Stanford has exclusively licensed its rights to us under the 2015 Stanford Agreement. These pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2037 and 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available. We also have seven pending patent applications, including one pending U.S. nonprovisional patent application, one pending U.S. provisional application, and five pending foreign patent applications, which we solely own, directed to the clinical use of our lead product candidate BDC-1001, as well as one pending European patent application, which we solely own, directed to a method of preparing immunoconjugates, which could be utilized to prepare our lead product candidate BDC-1001 or other Boltbody ISACs. These pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2038 and 2043, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available.

In addition, we have 163 pending patent applications directed to potential products and methods other than our lead product candidate BDC-1001 and the use thereof, including 139 pending patent applications that are solely owned by us, 17 pending patent applications that we co-own with Stanford and have exclusively licensed under the 2015 Stanford Agreement, one pending patent application that is solely owned by Stanford and that we have exclusively licensed under the 2015 Stanford Agreement, five pending patent applications that are solely owned by Stanford and that we have exclusively licensed under the 2018 Stanford Agreement, and one pending patent application that is co-owned with Innovent. Of these 163 pending patent applications, five are U.S. provisional patent applications, 11 are PCT applications that have yet to enter the national phase in one or more countries, 20 are U.S. nonprovisional patent applications, and 127 are foreign patent applications. These pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2035 and 2043 excluding any extension of patent term that may be available.
The patents and patent applications licensed from Stanford are subject to retained rights by Stanford to allow academic and non-profit research institutions to practice the licensed technology and patents for non-commercial purposes. The patents and patent applications licensed from Stanford pursuant to the 2018 Stanford Agreement are additionally subject to a non-exclusive, worldwide license held by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to exercise such intellectual property rights for research purposes, with the right to sublicense to non-profit and governmental entities. For more information regarding our license agreements with Stanford, please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements.”
Some of our pending patent applications in the United States are provisional patent applications. Provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of one or more of our related provisional patent applications. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage.
The terms of individual issued patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent applications or the dates of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application, assuming the patent has not been terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor, or over a patent not commonly owned but that was disqualified as prior art as the result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement. The life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is therefore limited and once our issued patents have expired, we may face competition, including from other competing technologies. In addition, in certain instances, the term of a U.S. patent can be extended to recapture a portion of the delay by the USPTO in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug or a method for using it may be extended. We may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements.
Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. There can be no assurance that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product-by-product basis and from country to country and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.

Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how, confidential information, unpatented technologies, continuing technological innovation and other proprietary information to develop, protect and maintain our competitive position and aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not presently consider appropriate for, patent protection and prevent competitors from reverse engineering or copying our technologies. However, the foregoing rights, technologies and information are difficult to protect. We seek to protect them by, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and any potential commercial partners and collaborators and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have implemented or intend to implement confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our selected consultants and any potential commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. There can be no assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual or proprietary rights of third parties. The issuance of third-party patents could require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, change our products or processes, obtain licenses to additional third-party patents or other intellectual property or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future products may have an adverse impact on us. Given that patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially longer and the publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the patent protection being sought by third parties and/or the priority of inventions covered by such patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference, revocation, derivation, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, or opposition proceedings brought by third parties or declared by the USPTO or an equivalent foreign body. See “Risk Factors–Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information regarding these and other risks related to our intellectual property portfolio and their potential effect on us.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state, and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, and export and import of drug and biological products, such as our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
Regulatory Approval in the United States and European Union
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. These regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products such as our Boltbody ISAC product candidates. Our Boltbody ISACs and monoclonal antibodies are subject to approval for marketing via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory and animal studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 


•approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be commenced; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
 •submission to the FDA of a BLA and payment of any user fees for FDA review of the BLA; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic, or components thereof, will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of any potential FDA audits of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data; 
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee; and 
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, where applicable, and post-approval studies required by the FDA as a condition of approval. 
 The process in the European Union and other countries or jurisdictions with developed regulatory regimes is broadly comparable.
Preclinical Studies
Before testing any biological product candidates in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated in the trial. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites, and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Disclosure of the results of these clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years

after the date of completion of the trial.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may still submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the clinical trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and reflected the makeup of the United States population, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3:
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or subjects with the target disease, usually studying an escalating single dose or multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of Phase 1 trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability, safety of the product candidate, determine the dosing regimen(s) for subsequent investigations, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in subjects with the target disease to evaluate effectiveness for a specific indication or indications. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected and possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified. 
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate clinical efficacy of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of a product. 
 These phases may overlap or be combined. For example, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial may contain both a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage, the latter of which may confirm tolerability at the recommended dose for expansion in future clinical trials (as in traditional Phase 1 clinical trials) and provide insight into the anti-tumor effects of the investigational therapy in selected subpopulation(s).
Typically, during the development of oncology therapies, all subjects enrolled in Phase 1 clinical trials are disease-affected patients and, as a result, considerably more information on clinical activity may be collected during such trials than during Phase 1 clinical trials for non-oncology therapies. A single Phase 3 or Phase 2 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness (generally subject to the requirement of additional post-approval studies).
Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 and other types of clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies, and must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the investigational medicines do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 In 2014, Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 was adopted. The new Regulation is directly applicable in all EU Member States (without national implementation) and entered into application on January 31, 2022. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Pursuant to the Regulation, the sponsor shall submit a single Clinical Trial Application (CTA) via the EMA's Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS, which will cover all regulatory

and ethics assessments from the member states concerned.
Any submissions made from January 31, 2023, onwards must be made through CTIS and all trials authorized pursuant to the Directive that are still ongoing on January 31, 2025, must have their details registered on CTIS. In both cases trials registered on CTIS must comply with the Regulation. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a member state's requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Approval and monitoring of clinical trials in the EU is, as it was under the Directive, the responsibility of individual member states, but compared to the position prior to the applicability of the Clinical Trials Regulation there is likely to be more collaboration, information-sharing, and decision-making between member states. The new Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting and introduces enhanced transparency requirements, such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to a new EU Database. Clinical trials must be carried out in accordance with GCP.
 Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry, and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic or drug may be marketed in the United States.
The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. The applicant under an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee.
The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA for a new molecular entity and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the BLA and may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies, or manufacturing for the FDA to reconsider the application. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months, depending on the type of information included. Even if

such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure a product’s safe use, or ETASU. An ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient-specific registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
An application for authorization to market a product in the European Union, or one or more member states, proceeds under one of four procedures: a centralized authorization procedure, a mutual recognition procedure, a decentralized procedure or a national procedure. Since our products, by virtue of being antibody-based biologics, fall under the centralized procedure, only this procedure will be described here. A successful application under the centralized authorization procedure results in a marketing authorization from the European Commission, which is automatically valid in all European Union member states. The other European Economic Area member states (namely Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein) are also obligated to recognize the European Commission decision. The EMA and the European Commission administer the centralized authorization procedure.
Under the centralized authorization procedure, the CHMP serves as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of human products on behalf of the EMA. The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member state’s national drug authority, with one of them appointed to act as Rapporteur for the coordination of the evaluation with the possible assistance of a further member of the CHMP acting as a Co-Rapporteur. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout its life cycle. The CHMP is required to issue an opinion within 210 days of receipt of a valid application, though the clock is stopped to ask the applicant for clarification of anything contained within the application or further supporting data. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory authorities of member states and a number of experts. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report is produced. If the CHMP concludes that the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product is sufficiently proven, it adopts a positive opinion. The CHMP’s opinion is sent to the European Commission, which uses the opinion as the basis for its decision whether to grant a marketing authorization. If the opinion is negative, information is given as to the grounds on which this conclusion was reached. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout its life cycle.
 Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation on its own does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication. In the latter case, because healthcare professionals are free to prescribe products for off-label uses, based on their independent medical judgment, the competitor’s product could be used for the orphan indication despite another product’s orphan exclusivity.
FDA's determination of whether two antibody–drug conjugates, or ADCs, are the same product for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity is based on a determination of sameness of the monoclonal antibody element and the functional element of the conjugated molecule. Two ADCs are deemed to be the same product if the complementarity determining region sequences of

the antibody and the functional element of the conjugated molecule are the same. A difference in either of those two elements can result in a determination that the molecules are different.
Regulation (EC) 141/2000 states that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug in the European Union if its sponsor can establish (i) that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and (ii) that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. Regulation (EC) 847/2000 sets out criteria for the designation of orphan drugs. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a 10-year period of orphan market exclusivity, during which the EMA and European Union Member States shall not accept another marketing authorization application for the same indication for a similar medicinal product. This period of orphan market exclusivity can be reduced to six years if it no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation by the end of the fifth year or extended to 12 years with an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.
Fast Track designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment, and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic candidate can request the FDA to designate the candidate for a specific indication for Fast Track status concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the biologic candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
Breakthrough therapy designation may be granted for products that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the biologic candidate. The FDA must determine if the biological product qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team, and taking other steps to design the clinical studies in an efficient manner.
Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.

Accelerated approval may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that generally provide a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large studies to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence and, in some cases, the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Similar conditional approval and accelerated assessment processes exist in the European Union for medicine that would fulfill an unmet medical need or therapeutic innovation. We believe that some of the disease indications in which our product candidates are currently being or may be developed in the future qualify for this provision, and we will take advantage of this provision as appropriate.
 Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each product lot before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each product lot to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, BLAs or supplements to BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, beginning in 2020, PREA will apply to BLAs for orphan-designated biologics if the biologic is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA has determined is substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.

The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or the BPCA, provides a six-month extension of any exclusivity–patent or non-patent–for a biologic if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all the benefits that designation confers.
 While there is no direct equivalent to the separate route for biologics, broadly equivalent requirements and controls similarly apply to the submission of pediatric testing and marketing authorization applications to the European Medicines Agency in the European Union and, post-approval, to the holding of such marketing authorizations, including conditionality.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA tightly regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities, involving the Internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the provisions of the approved labeling.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety summary reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. The FDA is authorized to conduct periodic unannounced inspections at any establishment where a biologic product is manufactured to assess cGMP compliance. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMP.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warnings or other enforcement-related letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 Broadly equivalent requirements, controls and sanctions similarly apply to supply, QA, manufacture, labeling, advertising, pharmacovigilance, and tracing of medicinal products as imposed by European Union laws and enforced by European Union national regulatory authorities.


U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch Waxman Amendments. The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term extension period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for such an extension, only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, we or our licensors may apply for patent term extension for our owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. However, an extension might not be granted because of, for example, our or our licensors’ failure to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failure to apply within applicable deadlines, failure to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or any other failure to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than requested. There is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether any extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch.


A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of Brexit and the United Kingdom officially withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020. Great Britain is no longer covered by the European Union’s procedures for the grant of marketing authorizations (Northern Ireland is covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). A separate marketing authorization will be required to market drugs in Great Britain. For two years from 1 January 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, may adopt decisions taken by the European Commission on the approval of new marketing authorizations through the centralized procedure, and the MHRA will have regard to marketing authorizations approved in a country in the European Economic Area (although in both cases a marketing authorization will only be granted if any Great Britain-specific requirements are met). Various national procedures are now available to place a drug on the market in the United Kingdom, Great Britain, or Northern Ireland, with the main national procedure having a maximum timeframe of 150 days (excluding time taken to provide any further information or data required). The data exclusivity periods in the United Kingdom are currently in line with those in the European Union, but the Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides that the periods for both data and market exclusivity are to be determined by domestic law, and so there could be divergence in the future.
Gaining orphan drug designation in Great Britain following Brexit is based on the prevalence of the condition in Great Britain (rather than in the European Union). It is therefore possible that conditions that are currently designated as orphan conditions in Great Britain will no longer be and that conditions that are not currently designated as orphan conditions in the European Union will be designated as such in Great Britain. Unlike in the European Union, applications for orphan drug designation in Great Britain are reviewed in parallel with the corresponding marketing authorization application.
The regulatory framework in place in the United Kingdom in relation to clinical trials is derived from the European Union's Clinical Trials Directive, as implemented into United Kingdom law. The Clinical Trials Regulation does not apply in Great Britain. It is uncertain as to what extent the United Kingdom will seek to align its regulations with the Clinical Trials Regulation, and there are already added administrative burdens as a result of Brexit for trials that take place both in the United Kingdom and the European Union, for example United Kingdom sponsored trials that also have sites in the European Union now need to have a legal representative in the European Union.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States and Europe, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales, and distribution of product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or European Commission approval.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Regulations and Legislative Reform
U.S. Healthcare and Privacy Laws and Regulations
Healthcare providers and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our operations, including any arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell, and distribute our products. The healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 •Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, such as the Federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. 
 •The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, among other things, imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement to a healthcare benefits program. 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, which impose obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon covered entities (including health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers), their respective business associates and their covered subcontractors that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. 
 •Federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. 
 •The federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, which requires, among other things, certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians, (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests. 
 •State and foreign laws that are analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may impose similar or more prohibitive restrictions, and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 
 •State and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with certain compliance guidelines, or to track and report payments and other remuneration provided to healthcare providers; state laws that require the reporting of marketing expenditures or drug pricing,; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state laws that prohibit various marketing-related activities; and other federal, state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other current or future healthcare laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting and oversight obligations, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. In addition, if any physicians or healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.

Legislative Reform
We operate in a highly regulated industry, and new laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations, and decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery and payment for healthcare products and services could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and prospects. There is significant interest in promoting healthcare reforms, and it is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and the governments of other countries will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation. For example, the U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In 2010, the ACA was enacted which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs.
While there have been executive judicial and congressional challenges to the ACA, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. For example, in 2017, the U.S. Congress enacted the Tax Act, which eliminated the tax-based, shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the "donut hole" under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial and congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.
In addition, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In 2011, the U.S. Congress enacted the Budget Control Act, which included provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers beginning in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect until 2031 unless additional congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In 2012, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Furthermore, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. This has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. Further, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Additionally, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future.
Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
We and our third-party contractors are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Hazardous chemicals, including flammable and biological materials, are involved in certain aspects of our business, and we cannot eliminate the risk of injury or contamination from the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our product candidates use PBDs, which are highly potent cytotoxins that require special handling by our and our contractors' staff. In the event of contamination, injury, or failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, fines and penalties associated with such liability could exceed our assets and resources. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
The availability and extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement by governmental and private third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive medical treatments. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our product candidates will depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors decide which products will be covered and establish reimbursement levels for those products.
Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 •safe, effective and medically necessary; 
 •appropriate for the specific patient; 
 •cost-effective; and 
 •neither experimental nor investigational. 
 Obtaining coverage approval and reimbursement for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement at a satisfactory level. If coverage and adequate reimbursement of our future products, if any, are unavailable or limited in scope or amount, such as may result where alternative or generic treatments are available, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. Adverse coverage and reimbursement limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in our product candidates, even if such product candidates obtain regulatory approval.
There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. There is no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement in the United States and, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the CMS, which decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors often, but not always, follow the CMS’ decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement. It is difficult to predict what third-party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for that product. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. In addition to third-party payors, professional organizations and patient advocacy groups such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology can influence decisions about reimbursement for new medicines by determining standards for care. Therefore, it is possible that any of our product candidates, even if approved, may not be covered by third-party payors or the reimbursement limit may be so restrictive that we cannot commercialize the product candidates profitably.

Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more restrictive than payors in the United States. For example, a number of cancer products have been approved for reimbursement in the United States but not in certain European countries. In Europe, decisions about pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In certain countries, new products may be marketed after agreement on reimbursement price has been reached. Such pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Other countries require additional health technology assessments that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. In addition, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products reimbursed by their national health insurance systems to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. With pricing and reimbursement decisions taking place at the member state level, member states may approve a specific price for a product, adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market or monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. Furthermore, many countries in the European Union have increased the number of discounts required on pharmaceutical products. These efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. There can be no assurance that any country with reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. Accordingly, reimbursement for any products in Europe may be lower, compared to the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of foreign and domestic governments as well as private third-party payors. The pricing of drugs has been a focus in this effort. Governments and private third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. We also expect to experience pricing pressures due to the trend towards managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes. These and other cost-control initiatives could cause us to decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in lower-than-anticipated product revenues. In addition, the publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or if coverage and adequate reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, our revenues, and the potential profitability of our product candidates in those countries would be negatively affected.
Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 94 employees, all of whom were full-time. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
We recognize that attracting, motivating, and retaining talent at all levels is vital to our continued success. Our employees are a significant asset, and we aim to create an equitable, inclusive, diverse, and empowering environment in which our employees can grow and advance their careers. Our overall goal is to develop, expand and retain our workforce in support of our current pipeline and future business objectives.
