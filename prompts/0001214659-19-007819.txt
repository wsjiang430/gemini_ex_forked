ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Our Company
 
Good Times Restaurants Inc., a Nevada corporation formed on October 6, 1996, operates and franchises Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants (“BDBB” or “Bad Daddy’s”) and Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard (“GTBFC” or “Good Times”) restaurants. Bad Daddy’s and Good Times are two distinctly different, yet complementary, restaurant concepts. Each is positioned as a high-quality brand within its respective segment of the industry. Bad Daddy’s is positioned at the upper end of the full-service casual theme restaurant segment and Good Times is positioned at the upper end of the quick-service restaurant segment.
 
Through our subsidiaries, as of December 16, 2019, we own, operate, franchise, or license a total of thirty-nine Bad Daddy’s restaurants in seven states. We own and operate twelve Bad Daddy’s restaurants in Colorado, one Bad Daddy’s restaurant in Oklahoma, fifteen Bad Daddy’s restaurants in North Carolina, and ten Bad Daddy’s restaurants in three other states within the Southeast region of the US. Of these restaurants, four restaurants are operated through joint-venture arrangements where we are the operating partner and own between 23% and 75% interest in the joint-venture entities. We license the Bad Daddy’s brand for the Bad Daddy’s restaurant located in the Charlotte Douglas International Airport which is owned and operated by a third-party licensee. One additional Bad Daddy’s restaurant in Greenville, S.C. is operated by a third-party franchisee.
 
We currently own and operate or franchise thirty-four total Good Times restaurants. Of these restaurants, thirty-two are in Colorado. Two of the restaurants are in Wyoming and are “dual brand” concept restaurants operated by a franchisee of both Good Times and Taco John’s.
 
The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” “Good Times” and similar terms refer to Good Times Restaurants Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Bad Daddy’s Franchise Development, LLC; Bad Daddy’s International, LLC; Good Times Drive-Thru Inc. (“Drive Thru”); and BD of Colorado, LLC.

Recent Developments
 
We previously entered into a credit agreement with Cadence Bank to provide the necessary capital to fund future Bad Daddy’s and Good Times locations as well as fund the continued remodel of existing Good Times locations and recurring capital expenditures. In October 2018, this agreement was amended to increase the borrowing capacity of the revolving line of credit to a total of $17,000,000. In February 2019, we entered into an amendment to the senior debt revolving line of credit to provide Consent for BDI to purchase all of the non-controlling equity interest of three joint-venture Bad Daddy’s entities in the Raleigh market. In December 2019, we entered into an amendment to the senior debt revolving line of credit in connection with the separation of the Company’s former CEO, to amend the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” for the purposes of financial covenants, to require certain installment payments, and to permit the company to make certain “Restricted Payments” (as defined in the Cadence Credit Facility).

Concepts
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar operates in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. Bad Daddy’s currently operates all of its company-owned restaurants under a table service / full-bar service model.
 
There are three primary elements of the concept that we try and differentiate for our guests:
 

1. | Artfully Crafted Food. The menu consists of chef-inspired burgers, salads, sandwiches, and appetizers made with high-quality ingredients with flavor profiles, portion sizes, and presentations that are premium to the casual dining segment of the industry. Many sauces and dressings are made in house and we offer our guests an assortment of non-beef alternatives, including buffalo, tuna, turkey and chicken. We offer our guests and unparalleled ability to customize their burgers and salads, including Create Your Own Burgers and Salads, restricted only by the ingredients available in the kitchen.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | A “Bad Ass Bar.” The food menu is complemented by a full bar that focuses on local and craft beers and unique, handcrafted cocktails. Two specialties are our Bad Daddy’s Amber Ale, available only at Bad Daddy’s, and our Bad Ass Margarita. System-wide, total alcoholic beverages account for approximately 15% of sales in our Bad Daddy’s restaurants. Our customers typically do not consider us a sports bar, but instead we focus on making our bar a place where both newcomers and regular guests can comfortably relax and enjoy a beverage at happy hour, with their meal, or at any other time of day.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Radical Hospitality. The restaurants have a high-energy yet family friendly environment with iconic pop culture design elements and a personal, ultra-friendly and informal service platform with a legacy of southern hospitality. Bad Daddy’s menu, service and environment are designed around a slightly irreverent brand personality, including menu items such as our Bad Ass Burger made with deep fried bacon, and iconic Farrah Fawcett and Paul Newman Cool Hand Luke posters in the men’s and women’s restrooms. We have developed our own playlist of classic rock and modern rock music that adds to the high energy atmosphere.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
This brand positioning results in transactions that generate an average per person check of approximately $17. The lunch daypart (open until 2pm) represents approximately 35% and the happy hour and dinner dayparts (2pm until close) represent approximately 65% of restaurant sales, withrestaurantsopening daily at 11 am and closing generally between 10 pm and 11 pm, with some restaurants open slightly later on weekends, depending on the surrounding trade area.
 
A typical Bad Daddy’s restaurant is approximately 3,500-4,000 square feet with an enclosed patio, smaller than most other casual dining restaurants. Based on average annual restaurant sales of approximately $2.6 million, Bad Daddy’s restaurants generate average sales per square foot of approximately $700, which we believe is a key metric indicating the strength and expansion potential of the concept. While sharing common design elements, each restaurant has unique features intended to create the impression that each Bad Daddy’s is local to its trade area and serves as a further point of differentiation from the larger casual dining chains. We believe Bad Daddy’s’ innovative menu and personalized service combined with a unique, fun restaurant design enhance our customers’ experience and differentiate Bad Daddy’s from its competitors.
 
Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard
 
Good Times is an upscale, quick-service restaurant concept offering fresh, 100% all-natural, hand-crafted products. We operate 26 Good Times restaurants, and franchise an additional eight, located primarily in the Denver market and along the front range of Colorado. We believe Good Times was the first quick-service chain in our region, and one of the first in the country to offer a menu of fresh all-natural Angus beef and all-natural chicken from animals that are humanely raised and vegetarian fed without the use of added hormones, steroids, or antibiotics.
 
We compete primarily on the quality of our products and we believe that our menu items are consistent with the quality found at fast casual restaurants, with quick-service restaurant speed. Our brand positioning is based on “Taking a Better Food Stand” supported by the marketing headline “Happiness Made to Order” with three primary brand pillars of Innovation, Quality, and Connectedness. Within Innovation, we strive to create products and flavor profiles available only at Good Times and that challenge traditional quick-service restaurant norms. We communicate Quality throughout our menu, from our made-to-order items to our fresh, all-natural, handcrafted attributes. We strive for Connectedness with our customers based on strong emotional ties to our brand through social media and radio advertising, appealing to an outdoor and active lifestyle, promoting high quality ingredients, by building an irreverent yet approachable brand personality and through community support and involvement.
 
Our average per person check is approximately $9.50, which we believe is lower than the average check at fast casual hamburger concepts such as Habit Burger, Five Guys, and Smashburger, but higher than the typical quick-service restaurant average check. We do not offer a low-priced value menu like most national and multi-regional quick-service chains, choosing to define our value proposition based on a range of price choices within each of our menu categories and the quality of our food.

Good Times is primarily a drive-through concept, as all our restaurants have at least one drive-through lane. Many of our restaurants have no indoor seating and consist of one or two drive-through lanes and outdoor patio seating. Speed of service in this segment is critical for success and we average less than three-minute transaction times, as measured from the time the customer places their order until they leave the drive-through lane. Even in our restaurants that feature dine-in seating, a majority of our sales are conducted through the drive-thru lane.
 
The success of our strategy is evident in our long-term same-store sales growth (sales growth over the prior year period at restaurants open more than 18 months, also referred to as comparable sales). Fiscal 2019’s minimal same store sales decline of (0.4%) followed comparable sales growth of 4.2% in fiscal 2018, 2.1% in fiscal 2017, 0.3% in fiscal 2016, 0.9% in 2015 and 14.6% growth in 2014.
 
Our Business Strengths
 
Our Brands Are Complementary.
 
While operating in different segments of the restaurant industry, our two brands share the following qualities:
 
Each is positioned at the upper end of its respective segment with the value proposition primarily driven by quality and uniqueness. Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar is an early entrant in the “small box” better burger casual dining segment. The menu contains chef-driven items with many made from scratch in our kitchens. Bad Daddy’s resonates with consumers by consistently executing high-quality menu items with unique flavor profiles that are delivered in a personalized, high-energy environment with a slightly irreverent brand personality.
 
We believe Good Times is the only quick-service chain in our region with an all-natural platform. We do not offer a dollar menu that many national chains do, choosing to compete on a market position emphasizing quality and uniqueness with a variety of price points across the menu and serving made-to-order products with quick-service restaurant speed of service.
 
Our Brands Have a Common Culture and Operating Philosophy.
 
While each of our brands is led by separate operating teams, each shares a commitment to four elements of success:
 

· | Values. Each brand focuses on developing behaviors and expectations around our core values of Integrity, Respect, Continuous Improvement, and Fun.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | People. Each brand seeks to hire high quality people throughout and provide them with comprehensive training programs designed to ensure that they deliver consistently superior products and service. Each has an incentive program at the restaurant level based on balanced metrics that drive customer service, personnel development, and financial performance.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Distinctive quality. Each brand strives to offer unique, high quality menu items with distinctive taste profiles made with fresh, high quality ingredients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Excellent systems. Each brand takes a “best practices” approach, cross-pollinating the best ideas that are applicable to either brand. We seek to provide the best operating systems and processes to ease the administrative burden of management, enabling them to focus on leading their team members and operating their restaurants. Our philosophy is that systems and processes drive financial success and leadership serves as an example and motivating force to our crew members who interact with our guests, driving sales and customer loyalty.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Brands Share a Similar Customer Demographic.
 
Due to the common strategic focus on a quality positioning, both Good Times and Bad Daddy’s appeal to a slightly higher income, more upscale consumer demographic profile. However, there is little, if any, overlap between the brands in how consumers use them. Good Times is convenience-driven and operates in the quick-service restaurant segment with a $9.50 per person average check deriving the majority of its sales from the drive-through occasion, while Bad Daddy’s provides a more destination-oriented, full-service dining occasion with an average per person check of approximately $17.
Our Brands Have Growth Potential.
 
We believe both of our brands are well positioned to take advantage of consumers’ growing demand for restaurants with fresh, high-quality, all-natural products that offer fully customizable menu choices. Consumers want to know where their food comes from, want to be able to customize menu items to fit their individual preference and dining occasions, and place a higher value on perceived healthiness and on brands they can trust to execute on those attributes. We believe Good Times and Bad Daddy’s are both well positioned to capitalize on those macro-trends.
 
Both of our brands currently operate with relatively small market penetration and overall development footprints, providing significant expansion potential. As we further develop our markets, we expect to realize efficiencies in supervision and development and training of our employees, as well as economies of scale in our supply chain cost structure. It is our goal to grow relatively contiguously from our existing operating bases in order to maximize brand awareness and operating and distribution efficiencies.

Good Times and Bad Daddy’s operate with a common point-of-purchase system and we have implemented a common back office system for both brands. We are also continuing to invest in sophisticated digital training tools, making each brand’s restaurant level processes, systems, recipes and management tools available in one commonly accessible database.
 
We Have Assembled a Dedicated Management Team with Significant Experience.
 
Each of the members of our senior management team have more than fifteen years of industry experience, with many members having worked together for more than 20 years developing the Good Times concept. Upon adding the Bad Daddy’s concept to the business, we made strategic hires to complement our management team with individuals with depth of experience in operating and growing full-service concepts.
 
Each of our brands are operated under separately dedicated management teams utilizing shared support services in administration, finance, accounting, human resources, development, marketing and information technology. We believe we have the processes and systems in place to support both concepts and targeted future growth of the Bad Daddy’s concept.
 
We Have Significant Operating Momentum.
 
Same-store sales at Good Times have increased eight of the past nine years. Although same-store sales declined for fiscal 2019, this was primarily due to the rollover of an unseasonably warm and dry winter during Fiscal 2018, and same-store sales increased in both of the final two quarters of fiscal 2019. Our compound same-store sales growth rate was approximately 45% from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2019. We believe this performance is largely the result of the evolution in our brand positioning, the re-imaging of several of our older restaurants, effective management of media mix, and consistent execution of the customer experience. We plan to continue to periodically re-image and remodel our restaurants, maintain a relevant menu in keeping with our brand strategy, and communicate our brand story to maintain our same-store sales growth.
 
The Bad Daddy’s concept was started in 2007 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Sales of the Bad Daddy’s restaurants which were open for at least 18 months averaged $2.6 million for the fifty-two weeks ended September 24, 2019. We opened four restaurants during fiscal 2019 in addition to the nine opened during fiscal 2018.
 
We believe that the strength of the Bad Daddy’s unit economic model provides us with significant expansion potential, both in our existing markets of the Southeastern U.S., and in new markets.
 
Business Strategies
 
We are focused on continuing to grow same store sales and improve the profitability of Drive Thru while continuing targeted unit growth the Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar concept in U.S. markets. We believe that there are significant opportunities to develop new units, grow customer traffic and increase awareness of our brands. The following sets forth the key elements of our growth strategy:

1. | Increase same-store sales in both brands. We intend to continue to focus on increasing our same-store sales. We plan to further strengthen our fresh, handcrafted, all-natural brand position at Good Times with menu innovation and targeted merchandising around each of our menu categories and focus around consumer price choice instead of deep discounts. We also expect to continue various advertising programs, shifting the media mix periodically as we determine appropriate to maximize advertising effectiveness and efficiency. We intend to increase Bad Daddy’s same store sales through continual innovation in both ongoing menu engineering that we believe drive increased customer visits as well as the per person average check. Bad Daddy’s advertising is targeted to individual trade areas, community involvement and in-store, “four-wall” marketing activities that focus on optimizing the guests’ food, bar and service experience. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Improve operational efficiencies and expense management. We continue to focus on managing our expenses in the operation of our restaurants and in our general and administrative functions, with a particular focus on cost of sales, labor and operating expense controls and efficiencies while not adversely impacting our overall quality and service proposition. Macroeconomic, state legislative increases to wages and other external factors have resulted in upward trends in certain of these operating costs. We continue to have implemented multiple programs to mitigate the impact of these external factors and continue to explore other opportunities to improve efficiency of general and administrative costs. We expect an elevated level of focus in managing overhead costs and gaining further efficiencies in supervision and support services costs.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Pursue disciplined unit growth of Company-operated Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants. We own the Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar brand, including all associated intellectual property. We have opened two new Bad Daddy’s restaurants subsequent to September 24, 2019 in the Charleston, SC and Columbia, SC markets. We are currently assessing our development strategies and intend to follow a disciplined strategy of unit growth that may include both company-owned and franchisee-owned units.

Expansion strategy and site selection
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar
 
Our development of the Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar concept in company-owned restaurants has focused on urban and suburban upper income demographic areas with median household incomes over $60,000, with a high concentration of daytime employment, upscale retail and movie theaters.  We continue to refine our site selection model with new data available upon each new unit opening.
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar locations are primarily end-cap locations in new and existing shopping center developments using approximately 3,500 to 4,000 square feet.  While our Good Times restaurants are free standing and require extensive site development and entitlement processes, Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants can be developed much more quickly due to the requirement for only a building permit, signage approvals and liquor license without the need for extensive on- and off-site development or land and zoning submittals and modifications. We estimate that it will take approximately 115 to 135 days to develop a Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar from the time a building permit is issued. We expect that most, if not all, of the Company’s unit growth will be through the development of additional Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar locations.
 
Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard
 
We do not have explicit plans to develop additional Good Times restaurants, as we believe that our highest return on investment opportunity is through the development of Bad Daddy’s locations. However, we expect that any opportunistic development in Good Times locations would be through a lens of growth in Colorado and potentially surrounding states, which would preserve operating and marketing efficiencies created by the geographic concentration of our existing base of restaurants.
 
Any development of new Good Times restaurants will involve our new prototype restaurant design on sites that are on or adjacent to big box or grocery store anchored shopping centers or in high activity and employment areas.  Our site selection for new restaurants is oriented toward slightly higher income demographic areas than many of our urban locations and most of our targeted trade areas are in relatively high growth areas of the Denver and northern Colorado markets.
 
We lease all of our sites.  When we do purchase and develop a site, we intend to ultimately sell the developed site into the sale-leaseback market under a long-term lease. Our primary site objective is to secure a suitable site, with the decision to buy or lease as a secondary objective.  Our site selection process includes evaluating several criteria, including a mix of substantial daily traffic, density of at least 30,000 people within a three-mile radius, strong daytime population and employment base, retail and entertainment traffic generators, good visibility and easy access.
 
Restaurant locations
 
As of December 16, 2019, we operate, franchise or license a total of thirty-nine Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar locations. The location in the Charlotte Douglas International Airport is operated pursuant to a License Agreement.
 
Additionally, we operate or franchise a total of thirty-four Good Times restaurants.
