Business History
 
LandStar, Inc. was incorporated as a Nevada corporation on May 4, 1998, for the purpose of purchasing, developing and reselling real property, with its principal focus on the development of raw land. From incorporation through December 31, 1998, LandStar had no business operations and was a development-stage company. LandStar did not purchase or develop any properties and decided to change its business plan and operations. On March 31, 1999, the Company acquired approximately 98.5% of the common stock of Rebound Rubber Corp. pursuant to a share exchange agreement with Rebound Rubber Corp. (“Rebound Rubber”) and substantially all of Rebound Rubber’s shareholders. The acquisition was effected by issuing 14,500,100 shares of common stock, which constituted 14.5% of the 100,000,000 authorized shares of LandStar, and 50.6% of the 28,622,100 issued and outstanding shares on completion of the acquisition. The acquisition was treated for accounting purposes as a continuation of Rebound Rubber under the LandStar capital structure. If viewed from a non-consolidated perspective, on March 31, 1999 LandStar issued 14,500,100 shares for the acquisition of the outstanding shares of Rebound Rubber.
 
The share exchange with Rebound Rubber (and other transactions occurring in March 1999) resulted in a change of control of LandStar and the appointment of new officers and directors of the Company. These transactions also redefined the focus of the Company on the development and exploitation of the technology to de-vulcanize and reactivate recycled rubber for resale as a raw material in the production of new rubber products. The Company’s business strategy was to sell the de-vulcanized material (and compounds using the materials) to manufacturers of rubber products.
 
Prior to 2001 the Company had no revenues. In 2001 and 2002 revenues were derived from management services rendered to a rubber recycling company.
 
In August 2001 the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to authorize 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value; and, 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value. Preferred stock. Preferred shares could be designated into specific classes and issued by action of the Company’s Board of Directors. In May 2008 the Company’s Board established a class of Convertible Preferred Series A (the “Series A”), authorizing 10,000,000 shares. The Series A provided for, among other things, (i) each share of Series A was convertible into 1,000 shares of the Company’s common stock; and, (ii) a holder of Series A was entitled to vote 1,000 shares of common stock for each share of Series A on all matters submitted to a vote by shareholders.
 
In September 2008 the Company amended its Articles to increase the number of authorized shares to 985,000,000, $0.001 par value. In January 2009 the Company amended its Articles to increase the number of authorized shares to 4,000,000,000, $0.001 par value. In January 2010 the Company once again amended its Articles to increase the number of authorized shares to 8,888,000,000, $0.001 par value.
 
The Company’s last filing of financial information with the SEC was the Form 10-QSB it filed on December 19, 2002 for the quarter ended 30 September 2002. No other filings were effected with the SEC until the Company filed a Form 15 May 19, 2008, which terminated the Company’s filing obligations with SEC.
 
The Company was effectively dormant for a number of years. In or around February 2014 there was a change in control when Kevin Hayes acquired 1,000,000 shares of the Series A, and was appointed as the sole director and officer. In or around April 2017 there was another change in control when Kevin Hayes sold the 1,000,000 shares of Series A to Hybrid Titan Management, which then proceeded to assign the Series A to William Alessi. Mr. Alessi was then appointed as the sole director and officer of the Company. Mr. Alessi initiated legal action in his home state of North Carolina to confirm, among other things, his ownership of the Series A; his “control” over the Company; and, the status of creditors of the Company. In or around June 2017 the court entered judgment in favor of Mr. Alessi.

In or around July 2017, while under the majority ownership and management of Mr. Alessi, the Company sought to effect a merger transaction (the “Merger”) under which the Company would be merged into Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. (“Data443”). Data443 was formed as a North Carolina corporation in July 2017 under the original name LandStar, Inc. The name of the North Carolina corporation was changed to Data443 in December 2017. In November 2017 the controlling interest in the Company was acquired by our current chief executive officer and sole board member, Jason Remillard, when he acquired all of the Series A shares from Mr. Alessi. In that same transaction Mr. Remillard also acquired all of the shares of Data443 from Mr. Alessi. Mr. Remillard was then appointed as the sole director and sole officer of the Company, and of Data443. Initially, Mr. Remillard sought to recognize the Merger initiated by Mr. Alessi and respect the results of the Merger. The Company relied upon documents previously prepared and proceeded as if the Merger had been effected.
 
In January 2018 the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Myriad Software Productions, LLC, which is owned 100% by Mr. Remillard. Those assets were comprised of the software program known as ClassiDocs, and all intellectual property and goodwill associated therewith. This acquisition changed the Company’s status to no longer being a “shell” under applicable securities rules. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company agreed to a purchase price of $1,500,000 comprised of (i) $50,000 paid at closing; (ii) $250,000 in the form of our promissory note; and, (iii) $1,200,000 in shares of our common stock, valued as of the closing, which equated to 1,200,000,000 shares of our common stock. The shares have not yet been issued and are not included as part of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company. However, these shares have been recorded as additional paid in capital within our consolidated financial statements for the period ending 31 December 2018.
 
In April 2018 the Company amended the designation for its Series A Preferred Stock by providing that a holder of Series A was entitled to (i) vote 15,000 shares of common stock for each share of Series A on all matters submitted to a vote by shareholders; and, (ii) convert each share of Series A into 1,000 shares of our common stock.
 
In May 2018 the Company amended and restated its Articles of Incorporation. The total authorized number of shares is: 8,888,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value; and, 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value, designated in the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Series A remains in full force and effect.
 
In June 2018, after careful analysis and in reliance upon professional advisors retained by the Company, it was determined that the Merger had, in fact, not been completed, and that the Merger was not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. As such, the Merger was legally terminated. In place of the Merger, in June 2018 the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Data443 (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Data443 became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with both the Company and Data443 continuing to exist as corporate entities. The finances and business conducted by the respective entities prior to the Share Exchange will be treated as related party transactions in anticipation of the Share Exchange. As consideration in the Share Exchange, we agreed to issue to Mr. Remillard: (a) One hundred million (100,000,000) shares of our common stock; and (b) On the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the closing of the Share Exchange (the “Earn Out Date”), an additional 100,000,000 shares of our common stock (the “Earn Out Shares”) provided that Data 443 has at least an additional $1MM in revenue by the Earn Out Date (not including revenue directly from acquisitions). None of our shares of our common stock to be issued to Mr. Remillard under the Share Exchange have been issued. As such, none of said shares are included as part of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company. However, the shares committed to Mr. Remillard have been recorded as common shares issuable and included in additional paid-in capital and the earn out shares have been reflected as a contingent liability for common stock issuable within the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018.
 
On or about June 29, 2018 we secured the rights to the WordPress GDPR Framework through our wholly owned subsidiary Data443 for a total consideration of €40,001, or $46,521, payable in four payments of €10,000, with the first payment due at closing, and the remaining payments issuable at the end of July, August and September, 2018. All of the payments were made and upon issuance of the final payment, we have the right to enter into an asset transfer agreement for the nominal cost of one euro (€1).

On or about October 22, 2018 we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Modevity, LLC (“Modevity”) to acquire certain assets collectively known as ARALOC™, a software-as-a service (“SaaS”) platform that provides cloud-based data storage, protection, and workflow automation. The acquired assets consisted of intellectual and related intangible property including applications and associated software code, and trademarks. While the Company did not acquire any of the customers or customer contracts of Modevity, the Company did acquire access to books and records related to the customers and revenues Modevity created on the ARALOC™ platform as part of the asset purchase agreement. These assets were substantially less than the total assets of Modevity, and revenues from the platform comprised a portion of the overall sales of Modevity. We are required to create the technical capabilities to support the ongoing operation of this SaaS platform. A substantial effort on the part of the Company is needed continue generating ARALOC™ revenues through development of a sales force, as well as billing and collection processes. We paid Modevity (i) $200,000 in cash; (ii) $750,000, in the form of our 10-month promissory note; and, (iii) 164,533,821 shares of our common stock.
 
Business Overview
 
The Company is in the data security business, seeking to operate as a cybersecurity software and services provider. As cybersecurity is a large market place, the Company is focused primarily on the data security sector of the market. Data security and privacy legislation, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), is driving significant investment by organizations to offset risks from data breaches and damaging information disclosures of various types. The Company will seek to provide solutions for the marketplace that are designed to protect data via cloud, hybrid, and on-premise architectures. Sensitive files and emails; confidential customer, patient, and employee data; financial records; strategic and product plans; intellectual property; and, all other data requiring security are the focus of the Company’s suite of security products and protocols, allowing our clients to create, share, and protect their data wherever it is stored.
 
Data443 delivers its solutions and capabilities via all technical architectures, and in formats designed for each client. Licensing and subscription models are available to conform to customer purchasing requirements. Our solutions are driven by several proprietary technologies and methodologies that we have developed and acquired, giving us our primary competitive advantage.
 
We intend to sell substantially all of our products and services directly to end-users, though some sales may also be effected through channel partners, including distributors and resellers which sell to end-user customers. We believe that our sales model, which combines the leverage of a channel sales model with our highly trained and professional sales force, will play a significant role in our ability to grow and to successfully deliver our value proposition for data security. While our products serve customers of all sizes, in all industries and all geographies, the marketing focus and majority of our sales focus is on targeting organizations with 100 users or more who can make larger purchases with us over time and have a greater potential lifetime value. We also intend to focus on the European Union as the GDPR has driven increased IT spending as companies seek to securely manage data and comply with the GDPR. Targeted industries include the financial services, healthcare, public, industrial, insurance, energy and utilities, consumer and retail, education, media and entertainment and technology sectors.
 
Size of Our Market Opportunity
 
Companies are expected to spend $124 billion worldwide on information security products and services in 2019, and a large portion of that spending is to ensure GDPR compliance. As cloud-based services increase in popularity, that market increases to an estimated $300 billion by 2021. The International Data Corporation’s Data Age 2025: The Evolution of Data to Life-Critical study estimates that the amount of data created in the world will grow to 163 Zettabytes (or 151 trillion gigabytes) in 2025, representing a nearly tenfold increase from the amount created in 2016. They estimate that nearly 20% of that data will be critical to our daily lives (and nearly 10% hypercritical). The study also suggests that by 2025, almost 90% of all data will require a meaningful level of security, but less than half will be secured. Every enterprise and governmental agency will almost certainly require new technologies to protect and manage data.

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our trade secrets or other confidential information. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, service providers, vendors and customers and generally limit internal and external access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information and proprietary technology through certain procedural safeguards. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property or technology. We cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or technology or infringement of our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.
 
Competition
 
The industry in which the Company competes is highly competitive. Many companies offer similar products and services for data security. We may be at a substantial disadvantage to our competitors who have more capital than we do to carry out operations and marketing efforts. We hope to maintain our competitive advantage by offering quality at a competitive price, and by utilizing the experience, knowledge, and expertise of our management team.
 
We will face competition from more established companies that have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, larger sales, marketing, research and acquisition resources, access to larger customer bases and channel partners, a longer operating history and lower labor and development costs, which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. Increased competition could result in us failing to attract customers or maintaining them. It could also lead to price cuts, alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products available for free or a nominal price, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles and loss of market share. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, our business and financial condition may be harmed.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 11 employees and independent contractors, of which 2 were considered to be part of our management team; 1 of those three is our sole director and sole officer, Jason Remillard. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
Government regulation
 
We are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may include business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.
 
Going Concern
 
We are dependent upon the receipt of capital investment and other financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our business plan. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our plan of operations. We may be required to obtain alternative or additional financing, from financial institutions or otherwise, in order to maintain and expand our existing operations. The failure by us to obtain such financing would have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in their report in our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to the effect that our losses from operations and our negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. We may be required to cease operations which could result in our stockholders losing all or almost all of their investment.
