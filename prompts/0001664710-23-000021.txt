ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel treatments for patients suffering from hematological, pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders with high unmet medical need. We are a leader in understanding the role of the transforming growth factor-beta, or TGF-ß, family of proteins, which are master regulators of red blood cell and platelet production as well as of the growth, repair and maintenance of a number of tissues, including blood vessels, skeletal muscle and heart tissue. We are leveraging this understanding to develop large and small molecules that have the potential to provide meaningful and potentially disease-modifying benefit to patients. Targeting TGF-ß signaling pathways has been clinically proven to elicit robust changes in blood cells, blood vessels, skeletal muscle and heart tissue, which we believe provides a precedent and strong rationale for our strategy. Our lead protein therapeutic product candidate, KER-050, is being developed for the treatment of low blood cell counts, or cytopenias, including anemia and thrombocytopenia, in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, and in patients with myelofibrosis. Our lead small molecule product candidate, KER-047, is being developed for the treatment of functional iron deficiency. Our third product candidate, KER-012, is being developed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, and for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. 
KER-050 is an engineered ligand trap comprised of a modified ligand-binding domain of the TGF-ß receptor known as activin receptor type IIA, or ActRIIA, that is fused to the portion of the human antibody known as the Fc domain. KER-050 is designed to increase red blood cell and platelet production by inhibiting the signaling of a subset of the TGF-ß family of proteins to promote hematopoiesis. We believe KER-050 has the potential to provide benefit to patients suffering from red blood cell and platelet differentiation and maturation defects occurring across the spectrum from early through terminal stages of hematopoiesis, and consequently may be effective for many patients that have limited treatment options or are refractory to available therapies. Based on data from our completed Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-050 in healthy volunteers and from multiple preclinical studies, we believe KER-050 has a differentiated pharmacologic effect on red blood cells and platelets and has the potential to treat multiple cytopenias in diseases of ineffective hematopoiesis while also improving bone health and altering the bone marrow microenvironment to slow down disease progression. In December 2022, we announced additional data from Part 2 of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating KER-050 for the treatment of anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients with very low-, low-, or intermediate-risk MDS. We expect to report additional data from Part 2 of this trial in each of the first and second half of 2023. Additionally, in December 2022, we announced initial data from our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating KER-050 for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias. We expect to report additional dose escalation data from this trial in the second half of 2023.
KER-047 is designed to selectively and potently inhibit activin receptor-like kinase-2, or ALK2, a TGF-ß receptor. Excessive ALK2 signaling causes elevated levels of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron absorption and recycling. We believe that KER-047 has the potential to ameliorate excessive ALK2 signaling, which would normalize hepcidin expression and mobilize iron out of tissues. We believe this effect will result in increased iron bioavailability, potentially leading to a restoration of erythropoiesis and reduction in iron overload in patients with functional iron deficiency. We are developing KER-047 for the treatment of functional iron deficiency which is a consequence of elevated ALK2 signaling, including our initial target, iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia, or IRIDA. In December 2022, we announced initial data from one patient enrolled in our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with IRIDA, and expect to report additional data from this trial in the second half of 2023. We also expect to commence an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial in MDS and myelofibrosis patients with functional iron deficiency in the first half of 2023, and expect to report initial data from this trial in the second half of 2023. 
KER-012 is designed to bind to and inhibit the signaling of TGF-ß ligands that stimulate smooth muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis, including activin A, activin B and myostatin (GDF8). We believe that KER-012 has the potential to increase the signaling of bone morphogenic protein, or BMP, pathways through this inhibition of activin A and activin B signaling, and consequently treat diseases such as PAH that are associated with reduced BMP signaling, including inactivating mutations in the BMP receptors. We are developing KER-012 for the treatment of PAH and for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-012 in healthy volunteers, and expect to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating KER-012 in patients with PAH in the first half of 2023. We also expect to commence an open-label Phase 2 biomarker clinical trial of KER-012 in the second half of 2023.
Our strategy focuses on the role of members of the TGF-ß family of proteins in the development of a number of tissues, including blood vessels, skeletal muscle and heart tissue. Aged and damaged cells are routinely replaced by new cells in normally functioning organs. These new cells are derived from stem cells that have the ability to differentiate into cells with specialized function when appropriate signals are provided to maintain the homeostatic state of the tissue. Members of the TGF-ß family of proteins, including activins and BMPs, provide the necessary signals for this process of self-renewal and repair.
We seek to address the limitations of current therapeutic approaches to treating diseases whose manifestations are linked to dysfunction of TGF-ß signaling pathways by:
▪Leveraging our comprehensive insights into the TGF-ß signaling pathways to discover therapeutics to treat hematological, pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders.
▪Expanding our library of proprietary molecules that are engineered to induce desired biological effects, such as increased blood cell production and increased muscle mass and strength.
▪Engineering proprietary molecules to selectively target specific proteins in the TGF-ß signaling pathways to provide therapeutic benefit while potentially minimizing safety risks.
▪Developing product candidates for the treatment of diseases where targeting the TGF-ß signaling pathways has clinical validation or biological rationale to improve our probability of success in the clinic.
▪Targeting the TGF-ß family of proteins, which are highly conserved throughout evolution, permitting the use of animal models to potentially predict with high confidence the therapeutic benefit in patients.
We are led by a highly experienced management team and scientific advisory board who have significant experience and expertise researching and developing therapeutics in the TGF-ß family of proteins. Our team has collectively worked on marketed therapeutics such as Reblozyl, Rituxan, Benlysta, Skyrizi, Kevzara, Rezurock, Cubicin, Tyzeka and Cosentyx, and led drug discovery and clinical development at companies including Acceleron Pharma Inc. (which was acquired by Merck & Co. Inc. in November 2021), Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc., F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (Roche), Novartis International AG, AbbVie Inc., Human Genome Sciences (with was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline plc in July 2012), Seres Therapeutics, Inc., Kadmon Holdings, Inc., Anokion SA and Sanofi S.A.

Our Pipeline
The following table sets forth our product candidates and their current development stages.



Our Strategy
Our mission is to deliver significant clinical benefit to patients suffering from hematological, pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders. With a focus on developing differentiated product candidates that are designed to alter TGF-β signaling, we aim to target the pathways critical for the growth, repair and maintenance of a number of tissue and organ systems. The key elements of our strategy include:
▪Rapidly advance the clinical development of KER-050 for the treatment of patients with MDS- and myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias. We are continuing to progress our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating KER-050 for the treatment of anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients with very low-, low-, or intermediate-risk MDS who either have or have not previously received treatment with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. We expect to report additional data from Part 2 of this trial in each of the first and second half of 2023. We also expect to announce additional data from our ongoing open-label Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias in the second half of 2023.
▪Advance the clinical development of KER-047 for the treatment of functional iron deficiency. We are continuing to progress our open-label Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with IRIDA and expect to report additional data from this trial in the second half of 2023. We also expect to commence an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial in MDS and myelofibrosis patients with functional iron deficiency in the first half of 2023, and expect to report initial data from this trial in the second half of 2023.
▪Rapidly advance the clinical development of KER-012 for the treatment of PAH and for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. We expect to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating KER-012 in patients with PAH in the first half of 2023. We also expect to commence an open-label Phase 2 biomarker clinical trial of KER-012 in the second half of 2023.
▪Pursue development and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates in indications and regions where we believe we can maximize their value independently or through strategic collaborations. We plan to independently advance our product candidates in indications and regions that we believe have clearly defined regulatory paths and commercialization strategies. We intend to opportunistically evaluate strategic collaborations to maximize the potential commercial value of our product candidates and discovery programs.
▪Leverage our proprietary discovery approach and knowledge base to develop new therapeutics. Our discovery efforts are focused on expanding our pipeline of wholly-owned assets for the treatment of hematological, pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders. Accordingly, we intend to identify and develop product candidates to treat diseases where targeting the TGF-ß signaling pathways has clinical validation or biological rationale.
Our Hematology Franchise
KER-050 and KER-047, which form the backbone of our hematology franchise, are designed to target TGF-ß signaling pathways to address diseases that arise from ineffective hematopoiesis and functional iron deficiency, respectively.
Hematopoiesis
The primary cellular components of blood are red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. The function of red blood cells is to distribute oxygen to tissues throughout the body and to carry waste carbon dioxide back to the lungs. White blood cells are responsible for the immune response through coordinated surveillance and targeting of pathogens, infected or aberrant cells and cell debris. Platelets are a key component of the coagulation system and are responsible for stopping bleeding by forming a blood clot.
Hematopoiesis is the production of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets from common progenitor stem cells, or progenitor cells, in the bone marrow. This process begins when a hematopoietic progenitor cell becomes committed to a specific cellular lineage. These cells progress through a series of intermediate stages before becoming a mature cell with a specialized function. At any given time, pools of each progenitor cell are maintained and primed to rapidly respond to a reduction of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. The graphic below depicts the stages of hematopoiesis for red blood cells and platelets.
Stages of Hematopoiesis
TGF-ß signaling pathways involving activins prevent differentiation in order to maintain progenitor cells in a quiescent state while others involving BMPs promote differentiation of progenitor cells. Homeostasis of this process is essential to ensure all cell types are properly replenished in the blood.
In many hematological disorders, there is abnormal proliferation and differentiation of the progenitor cells for red blood cells, platelets and neutrophils. This failure to produce fully mature cells is termed ineffective hematopoiesis, and may be due to single or multiple defects that can lead to a hyperproliferation or a shortage of progenitor cells.
These changes have clinical consequences: a lack of red blood cells leads to anemia, a lack of platelets hampers clotting, resulting in increased incidence of bleeding events, and a lack of neutrophils increases susceptibility to infection. The failure of progenitor cells to differentiate can also lead to a build-up of these cells, resulting in bone marrow failure and fibrotic disease. The graphic below provides an illustration of the difference in the number of progenitor cells and mature bloods cells that are produced in normal hematopoiesis and in ineffective hematopoiesis.
Another critical component in red blood cell development is the production of hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein that delivers oxygen to cells and removes carbon dioxide. The synthesis of hemoglobin requires that sufficient levels of iron are present in the bone marrow and if iron levels are too low, it can result in a failure to produce sufficient numbers of red blood cells. Anemia is a common consequence of diseases where normal iron mobilization is hindered.
KER-050: For the Treatment of Ineffective Hematopoiesis to Address Cytopenias
We are developing KER-050, our lead protein therapeutic product candidate, for the treatment of cytopenias that occur due to ineffective hematopoiesis, including anemia and thrombocytopenia, in patients with MDS and in patients with myelofibrosis. KER-050 is designed to benefit patients suffering from defects in red blood cell and platelet differentiation and maturation across the spectrum from early through terminal stages of hematopoiesis. Consequently, KER-050 may be effective for many patients that have limited treatment options or are refractory to available therapies.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
MDS is a collection of bone marrow disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, often with a dramatic expansion of progenitor cells that are unable to mature into functioning blood cells. In the United States, there are 60,000 to 170,000 patients with MDS and 15,000 to 20,000 new cases of MDS reported each year. MDS predominantly affects older adults, with approximately 75% of patients aged 60 years or older at diagnosis. Median survival ranges from approximately nine years for very low-risk patients to less than a year for high-risk patients.
Cytopenias in MDS are caused by defects occurring across the various stages of hematopoiesis, from the self-renewal of progenitor cells to differentiation in early through terminal stages. Anemia is the most frequent consequence of ineffective hematopoiesis in patients with MDS due to low red blood cell production, and impacts 90% of MDS patients, with approximately 40% becoming transfusion dependent. Another consequence is thrombocytopenia, a deficiency of platelets in the blood, which is impaired blood clotting that can cause bleeding. The prevalence of thrombocytopenia in patients with MDS has been reported at 40% to 65%. A deficiency of neutrophils in the blood, or neutropenia, also increases the risk of serious infections in patients with MDS and has been reported to affect approximately 20% of patients with MDS.
To guide decisions on risk stratification and the treatment of patients with MDS, clinicians typically use the International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised, or the IPSS-R. The IPSS-R incorporates information on bone marrow blast percentage, karyotype and presence and severity of cytopenias in order to classify patients with MDS into groups based on the risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia, ranging from very low-risk to high-risk. Patients are further classified into high transfusion burden and low transfusion burden categories based on the number of units of transfused red blood cells they receive.
A second classification system is the World Health Organization, or WHO, system, which is based on a combination of morphology, immunophenotype, genetics and clinical features. The WHO classification system includes a subgroup of patients with MDS that show the presence of iron deposits around the mitochondria, known as ring sideroblasts. These patients are commonly referred to as RS positive and comprise approximately 15% of incident patients with MDS, and splicing factor mutations, such as SF3B1, are highly correlated with these patients. Patients with splicing factor mutations often have been observed to have defects in the differentiation of red blood cells at the terminal stage. The majority of patients with MDS that develop cytopenias lack ring sideroblasts or a single, defining splicing factor mutation and are termed non-RS. These non-RS patients have differentiation and maturation defects occurring across the spectrum from early through terminal stages of hematopoiesis.
Limitations of Current Treatment Options for Cytopenias in Patients with MDS
Patients with MDS-associated anemia are generally treated with red blood cell transfusions and erythropoises-stimulating agents, or ESAs, which are not approved for such treatment. The current treatment of MDS-associated thrombocytopenia is platelet transfusions and platelet-stimulating agents.
Severe cytopenia and transfusion dependence are independent predictors of poor prognosis for patients with MDS and are inversely correlated with quality of life. Red blood cell and platelet transfusions provide temporary benefits to patients with MDS, but are associated with both acute and chronic health risks, including risk of bacterial infection and allergic reactions to the donor blood, and place a significant burden on both the patient and the healthcare system. Repeated red blood cell transfusions are also associated with iron overload, further exacerbating damage to the bone marrow and increasing the risk of acute myeloid leukemia progression and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the benefit from a platelet transfusion is typically short-lived and availability is limited. Platelet-stimulating agents for the treatment of thrombocytopenia, which are not currently indicated for MDS, carry the risk of thromboembolic events and bone marrow fibrosis.
ESAs are a class of drugs that work on the proliferation stage of red blood cell development by expanding the pool of early-stage progenitor cells. While ESAs have been shown to alleviate anemia in a subset of patients with MDS, patients that have elevated endogenous erythropoietin levels are unlikely to respond. In two controlled Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) and epoetin alpha (Epogen/Procrit) for the treatment of MDS-associated anemia, 15% to 31% of patients responded, respectively. However, this response was limited to patients with low endogenous erythropoietin levels at baseline and to patients who had a low transfusion burden at baseline. These treatment options also represent a significant burden to patients; epoetin alpha must be administered up to three times a week. Additionally, the effect of ESAs is limited to the red blood cell lineage and, therefore, ESAs only treat MDS-associated anemia and do not provide benefit to cytopenia of other cell lineages, including thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.
Reblozyl, a TGF-ß-based erythroid maturation agent, is designed to promote the terminal differentiation of red blood cells through inhibition of selected endogenous TGF-ß superfamily ligands. The characteristics of response were defined in a Phase 2 clinical trial of Reblozyl in patients with MDS. Consistent with the mechanism of Reblozyl on the terminal stages of erythropoiesis, the majority of responders were determined to have an SF3B1 splicing factor mutation. Additionally, the responders were characterized as having increased erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, while patients with fewer erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow did not achieve hematological improvement. We believe this indicates that Reblozyl is limited to its effect on terminal differentiation of erythropoiesis and does not affect the early stages of differentiation.
Reblozyl received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in April 2020 for the treatment of anemia in adult RS positive patients with very low- to intermediate-risk MDS that failed an erythropoiesis stimulating agent and required two or more units of red blood cells over eight weeks. The approval was based on a single Phase 3 clinical trial of Reblozyl that was conducted in RS positive, very low- to intermediate-risk patients with MDS. This trial included both patients with low transfusion dependence requiring fewer than four units of red blood cells over eight weeks and patients with high transfusion dependence requiring four or more units of red blood cells over eight weeks. In this trial, 37.9% of the RS positive patients treated with Reblozyl achieved the primary endpoint of transfusion independence, compared to 13.2% of patients that received placebo. The highest proportion of responders to Reblozyl were those with low transfusion dependence, while only a few high transfusion burden patients achieved transfusion independence despite being RS positive patients.
Accordingly, we believe that additional treatment options will be needed to address anemia in the heterogeneous non-ring sideroblast MDS population, to provide clinical benefit to the RS positive population regardless of transfusion burden and to address other cytopenias, such as thrombocytopenia.
KER-050 is designed to alter TGF-ß signaling pathways at multiple stages of hematopoietic differentiation in both red blood cells and platelets. Consequently, we believe KER-050 has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit in a broader subset of patients with MDS that have varying defects in commitment, differentiation and maturation of multiple cell types found in blood.
Myelofibrosis
Myelofibrosis is a group of rare cancers of the bone marrow in which the marrow is replaced by scar tissue and is not able to produce healthy blood cells. As a result, the spleen begins to produce cells to compensate for this ineffective hematopoiesis, which ultimately causes the spleen to enlarge. Myelofibrosis is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, an enlarged spleen, bone marrow fibrosis and shortened survival. Patients often experience multiple disease-associated and treatment-emergent cytopenias, including anemia and thrombocytopenia.
The ineffective hematopoiesis in myelofibrosis is driven by molecular abnormalities in the Janus kinase 2, or JAK2, -signal transducers and activators of transcription, or JAK-STAT, signaling pathway of transcriptional activators. Specifically, JAK2 activation leads to proliferation of red blood cell progenitors and platelet progenitors, or megakaryocytes, that fail to mature to platelets. Additionally, megakaryocyte dysplasia/hyperplasia has been implicated in inducing bone marrow fibrosis in patients with myelofibrosis. The inability of megakaryocytes to fully differentiate leads to the release of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors that results in scarring of the bone marrow, which further exacerbates the myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias.
Myelofibrosis is a relatively rare condition with an identified prevalence of 16,000 to 18,500 patients in the United States. Approximately 3,000 new patients are diagnosed with myelofibrosis each year, and the median age at diagnosis is approximately 60 years. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options to address the myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias. Within a year of diagnosis, 38% of patients with myelofibrosis are red blood cell transfusion dependent and eventually nearly all will develop transfusion dependence. Additionally, within a year of diagnosis, 26% of patients with myelofibrosis will develop thrombocytopenia and 51% will develop anemia.
Limitations of Current Treatment Options for Cytopenias in Patients with Myelofibrosis
There are no approved pharmacological treatments for myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network describes all therapeutic options to address myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias, including transfusions, as only minimally effective.
Currently approved products for the treatment of myelofibrosis, including JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib (Jakafi), fedratinib (Inrebic) and pacritinib (Vonjo), have been observed to exacerbate myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias. In a third-party Phase 3 clinical trial of Jakafi and a third-party Phase 3 clinical trial of Inrebic, treatment led to significant reductions in spleen volume and improvement in total symptom scores. However, JAK inhibitors interfere with normal hematopoiesis and treatment with Jakafi and Inrebic also resulted in clinically significant anemia and thrombocytopenia in these Phase 3 trials. Approximately 45% of patients in the Phase 3 clinical trial of Jakafi developed treatment-related grade 3 or 4 anemia. Grade 3 or higher adverse events of anemia and thrombocytopenia were observed in approximately 34% and 12%, respectively, of patients evaluated in the Phase 3 clinical trial of Inrebic. The treatment-related cytopenias led to severe complications, dose reductions and reduced compliance.
We believe KER-050 has the potential to ameliorate myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias.
Our Solution: KER-050
KER-050 is a ligand trap comprised of a modified ligand-binding domain of ActRIIA that is fused to the portion of the human antibody known as the Fc domain. KER-050 is designed to bind to and inhibit the signaling of TGF-ß ligands involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, including activin A, activin B and growth differentiation factor 11, that restrict blood cell progenitors from continuing through differentiation and developing into mature cells with specialized function. The KER-050-mediated inhibition of these regulators has been shown in preclinical studies to stimulate the progenitors to progress to maturation and, consequently, increase the number of mature cells in the blood. 
Specifically related to red blood cells, we have demonstrated in multiple preclinical studies that administration of a mouse version of KER-050, or RKER-050, elicited increases in red blood cell production in healthy mice by stimulating multiple stages in the maturation of erythroid precursors. The rapid and sustained increase in red blood cells observed in these preclinical studies suggests that RKER-050 potentially stimulated both terminal maturation of late-stage erythroid precursors to rapidly increase red blood cells and maturation of early-stage precursor populations to increase the pool of progenitors that can be mobilized for a sustained upregulation of erythropoiesis. Additionally, by increasing the pool of early erythroid precursor cells and serum erythropoietin, we believe KER-050 can potentially treat patients with MDS that have hypocellular bone marrow. We have also observed an increase in erythropoietin in healthy mice in preclinical studies of RKER-050, which we believe could contribute to the durability in red blood cell production and is supportive of the durability of the red blood cell increase we observed in our Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-050 in healthy post-menopausal women.
We have also demonstrated in preclinical studies that treatment with a single dose of RKER-050 resulted in rapid and sustained increases in platelets in healthy mice. We observed an increase in platelets 12 hours after administration of RKER-050, which we believe supports that KER-050 can potentially promote production of platelets by blocking inhibitory TGF-ß ligands so that megakaryocytes can fully differentiate. Additionally, bone marrow analysis performed 24 hours post-dose demonstrated that administration of RKER-050 increased the megakaryocyte precursor population, and that these cells had increased ploidy compared to vehicle-treated mice. These data suggest that RKER-050 promoted the maturation of early megakaryocyte populations and primed megakaryocytes for proplatelet production.
Separately, in a preclinical study in wild type mice, treatment with ruxolitinib resulted in reductions in red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit, recapitulating the anemia observed in myelofibrosis patients. Administration of RKER-050 reversed the observed ruxolitinib-associated reductions in the red blood cell parameters, which we believe supports the potential of KER-050 to mitigate the dose-limiting effects of ruxolitinib and enhance the duration of therapy in myelofibrosis patients.
Data from our Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and our two ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials, one in patients with MDS and one in patients with myelofibrosis, also demonstrate that treatment with KER-050 increased red blood cell and platelet production. These data indicate that KER-050 is differentiated from available therapies because it appears to have both sustained and rapid effects on multiple cellular lineages in the hematopoietic pathway. We believe KER-050’s promotion of differentiation of early- and terminal-stage progenitor cells contributes to these sustained and rapid effects, respectively, and consequently, KER-050 may be effective for many patients that are refractory to available therapies and may potentially provide benefit in multiple cytopenias simultaneously.
Mechanism of Action of KER-050
Consistent with our preclinical studies, which showed improvement in bone health, we observed an increase in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, a biomarker of bone remodeling, in our Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers following administration of KER-050. Based on these data, we believe KER-050 also has the potential to regenerate a healthy bone marrow and slow disease progression.
We intend to develop KER-050 for the treatment of both MDS- and myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias. We believe KER-050 has the potential to overcome limitations of current treatment options for MDS- and myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias. We believe the potential advantages of KER-050 compared to current treatment options include:
•Dual mechanism affecting both the early and terminal stages of erythropoiesis. Patients with MDS can have defects occurring anywhere along the differentiation and maturation spectrum of erythropoiesis, and often have multiple mutations that cause ineffective erythropoiesis. By acting on cell types throughout the erythropoiesis pathway, KER-050 may lead to robust responses in RS positive patients who have a characteristic defect in terminal maturation, and may also address anemia in the broader MDS population, including non-RS patients, that has defects in earlier-stage erythroid cell development.
•Increased platelet counts in blood. Ineffective hematopoiesis in patients with MDS and in patients with myelofibrosis can result in thrombocytopenia, which can lead to an increased risk of bleeding events. We believe treatment with KER-050 has the potential to address the MDS- and myelofibrosis-associated thrombocytopenia. Additionally, by promoting thrombopoiesis, we believe KER-050 has the potential to aid the differentiation of megakaryocytes to platelets in myelofibrosis patients and reactivate hematopoiesis in the bone marrow.
•Reduced accumulation of progenitor cells. Ineffective hematopoiesis in patients with MDS and in patients with myelofibrosis can be caused by excessive production of blood cell progenitors that are unable to complete differentiation and ultimately become mature blood cells. We believe treatment with KER-050 will stimulate these progenitors to progress to maturation, ameliorating the accumulation of these cells that lead to MDS- and myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias.
•Regeneration of the bone marrow microenvironment to potentially slow disease progression. The bone marrow microenvironment is composed of bone cells, stromal cells, immune cells, blood vessels and nerves. Crosstalk in this osteo-hematopoietic niche determines the maintenance, self-renewal and eventual differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells to blood cells. Accordingly, a disease-impacted bone marrow microenvironment contributes to ineffective hematopoiesis and bone loss. In a preclinical study, administration of RKER-050 in a mouse model of MDS prevented the anemia and bone loss observed in the vehicle-treated MDS mice. We believe these data support the potential of KER-050 to alter the bone marrow microenvironment that is supportive of self-renewal and maintenance of normal hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells in patients with MDS and other hematological diseases, including myelofibrosis.
▪Robust and sustained increase in red blood cells, hemoglobin and reticulocytes, supporting monthly or less frequent dosing. ESAs can require dosing up to three times a week. We believe that treatment with KER-050 has the potential to reduce the frequency of dosing to every four weeks or less frequently, thereby decreasing the burden on patients and potentially improving compliance. 
Ongoing Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes
We are conducting an open label, two-part, multiple ascending dose Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate KER-050 in patients with very low-, low-, or intermediate-risk MDS who either have or have not previously received treatment with an ESA. The 
primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of KER-050 in patients with MDS that either have ring sideroblasts, or RS positive, or do not have ring sideroblasts, or non-RS. The primary objective of Part 2 of this trial is confirmation of the safety and tolerability of the selected dose levels. The secondary objectives of this trial are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of KER-050. The trial design is summarized in the figure below. 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial Design
KER-050 is being administered to patients subcutaneously once every four weeks. In Part 2, the dose confirmation portion of the trial, an identical dosing schedule was followed, and patients initiated treatment at a starting dose of 3.75 mg/kg, the recommended Part 2 dose, or RP2D, with the opportunity to dose escalate to 5.0 mg/kg or to down-titrate based on individual titration rules. Following completion of Part 1, eligible patients were given the opportunity to escalate up to the RP2D and receive long-term treatment with KER-050 for up to an additional 20 cycles, which we refer to as the Part 1 Extension.
In December 2022, we presented additional data from this ongoing trial at the 64th American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting and Exposition. As of October 1, 2022, which was the data cut-off date, 25 patients from Part 1, including the Part 1 Extension, and 11 patients from Part 2 had received at least one dose of KER-050 at RP2D, which we refer to as the safety population. 29 of these patients had completed eight weeks of treatment and the applicable assessments as of the data cut-off date, which we refer to as the evaluable RP2D patients.
Of the 36 patients in the safety population, 63.9% (n=23/36) were RS positive while 36.1% (n=13/36) were non-RS. The safety population was comprised of ten non-transfused, or NT, six low transfusion burden, or LTB, and 20 high transfusion burden, or HTB, patients.
As of the data cut-off date, 51.7% (n=15/29) of the evaluable RP2D patients achieved an overall erythroid response, which is defined as meeting one of the following two endpoints:
•IWG 2006 Hematological improvement-erythroid, or HI-E, which is defined as either:
◦a ≥ 1.5 g/dL increase in hemoglobin for eight weeks in LTB and NT patients; or
◦a reduction by ≥ 4 red blood cell units transfused during any eight-week period during the trial, compared with the eight-week period prior to cycle 1, Day 1 in HTB patients. 
•Transfusion independence, or TI, for at least eight weeks in transfusion-dependent patients who required ≥ 2 red blood cell units transfused at baseline.
Additional data from the evaluable RP2D patients, as of the data cut-off date, include:
•51.7% (n=15/29) of the evaluable RP2D population achieved HI-E over an eight-week period.
•50.0% (n=9/18) of the transfused RP2D patients receiving ≥ two red blood cell units at baseline achieved TI for at least eight weeks. Of these 18 patients, 12 were RS positive and six were non-RS.

◦Of these transfused RP2D patients, 50.0% (n=7/14) of those who are HTB achieved TI for at least 12 weeks.
As of the data cut-off date, sustained increases in platelet counts were observed for patients achieving HI-E or TI over a 24-week treatment period, supporting a potentially differentiated mechanism of KER-050 to promote hematopoiesis across multiple cell lineages.
As of the data cut-off date, KER-050 was generally well tolerated by the 36 patients in the safety population. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported, and no patients progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. There was one case of a fatal treatment-emergent adverse event, or TEAE, in the trial that was determined to be unrelated to treatment. There were three additional TEAEs that led to discontinuation of treatment, one of which was deemed treatment related (injection site reaction) and two of which were determined to be unrelated to treatment (dyspnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The most commonly reported TEAEs were diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea and nausea.
The following data from one patient enrolled in this trial was also presented:
•A 72-year-old non-RS, HTB male patient with MDS with multi-lineage dysplasia and concomitant iron chelation therapy achieved an initial HI-E response, but not TI, when treated with four 1.5 mg/kg doses of KER-050 in Part 1 of the trial. The patient was re-screened and initiated Part 1 Extension following a 112-day gap between the last dose he received in Part 1 of the trial and the first dose he received in the Part 1 Extension. The patient achieved TI upon recommencement of treatment at a 2.5 mg/kg dose of KER-050 every four weeks. After 24 weeks, the patient dose escalated to 3.75 mg/kg every four weeks per the trial protocol, and remained TI for at least 44 weeks as of the data cut-off date.
•As of January 9, 2023, this patient had remained TI for 60 weeks.
We also presented an exploratory analysis of biomarkers of iron overload, or IO, with data from the 31 patients who received up to four cycles of treatment in the completed Part 1. 58.1% (n=18/31) of these patients were classified as HTB. At baseline, transfusion-dependent patients exhibited biomarkers suggestive of a greater degree of ineffective hematopoiesis than NT patients, including lower levels of hemoglobin, reticulocytes and soluble transferrin receptor. In addition, lower levels of transferrin and elevated levels of serum ferritin at baseline, especially among HTB patients, suggest more severe IO in transfusion-dependent patients as compared to NT patients. Key observations from this analysis, as of the data cut-off date, are as follows:
•Soluble transferrin receptor levels generally increased with KER-050 treatment, particularly in HTB patients, while ferritin levels decreased.
•On an individual level, most patients who achieved HI-E or TI also showed decreases in serum ferritin. Such decreases were generally greater in patients with baseline ferritin of >500 ng/mL, suggesting potential for KER-050 to reduce IO in the most impacted patients.
•Reductions in transfusion burden, based on transfused red blood cells over eight weeks, were generally associated with reductions in serum ferritin, especially for patients who achieved TI.
Taken together, the results from the trial and the exploratory analysis as of the data cut-off date suggest that KER-050 has the potential to improve hematopoiesis, reduce transfusion burden and reduce IO, particularly in patients receiving frequent red blood cell transfusions.
Ongoing Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Myelofibrosis-Associated Cytopenias
We are conducting an open label, two-part, multiple ascending dose Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate KER-050 as a monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of KER-050 in patients with myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias. The primary objective of Part 2 of this trial is confirmation of the safety and tolerability of the selected dose levels. The secondary objectives of this trial are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of KER-050 administered with or without ruxolitinib. The trial design is summarized in the figure below. 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial Design
In December 2022, we presented initial data from this ongoing trial at the 64th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition. As of October 1, 2022, which was the data cut-off date, 12 patients were enrolled in Part 1, with six patients in each arm receiving 0.75 mg/kg dose of KER-050. For the patients in the combination therapy arm, the median ruxolitinib dose was 12.5 mg twice daily at baseline. As of the data cut-off date, in each of the arms, at least half of the enrolled patients had received three or more doses of KER-050. At baseline, 41.7% (n=5/12) were transfusion-dependent, with an average transfusion burden of 9.8 red blood cell units in the 12 weeks preceding cycle 1, Day 1.
As of the data cut-off date, KER-050 was generally well tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities reported. No patients had a treatment-related dose reduction of KER-050 or ruxolitinib as of the data cut-off date. The most commonly reported TEAEs were diarrhea, COVID-19, dyspnea and fatigue. One patient withdrew from the trial due to an unrelated adverse event.
Although variability was observed, as of the data cut-off date, treatment with KER-050 at the lowest dose in the trial (0.75 mg/kg) resulted in increased reticulocytes and platelets on aggregate across cycles 1 and 2. These increases were observed in both monotherapy and combination arms, as well as in both non-transfusion-dependent and transfusion-dependent patients. These data support the potential of KER-050 to potentially promote differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors and treat anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients with myelofibrosis.
The following data from two patients enrolled in this trial were also presented:
•In a 60 year-old, non-transfusion-dependent female patient with primary myelofibrosis in the monotherapy arm, an increase in reticulocytes was observed after a single 0.75 mg/kg dose of KER-050, which was followed by a sustained increase in hemoglobin of >1.5 g/dL over baseline with continued dosing for >12 consecutive weeks in the first 24 weeks of the trial. The observed increases in erythropoietic markers corresponded with sustained decreases in ferritin and erythropoietin, which is consistent with upregulation of erythropoiesis. An overall increase in platelet count was also observed in this patient.
•In a 75 year-old, transfusion-dependent male patient with high-risk myelofibrosis and severe thrombocytopenia in the combination arm, increases in reticulocytes and soluble transferrin receptor levels were observed following the first cycle of treatment. Though platelet counts fluctuated over the treatment period, improvements were observed following the second and third cycles. The patient experienced a reduction in red blood cell transfusion burden from nine units per 12 weeks pre-treatment to six units per 12 weeks post-treatment.
Clinical Development Strategy
We expect to complete enrollment in the transfusion-dependent cohorts in the Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with MDS in the second half of 2023, and expect to report additional data from Part 2 of the trial in the first half and the second half of 2023. We also expect to expand this trial to MDS patients with iron overload in the second half of 2023.
Separately, we expect to announce dose escalation data from the Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias and initiate Part 2 of this trial in the second half of 2023.
Completed Phase 1 Clinical Trial
In January 2020, we completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-part, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-050 in 48 healthy post-menopausal women. The primary objectives of this trial were safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. We also investigated changes in hematology and bone biomarkers in this clinical trial.
In Part 1 of this trial, 30 subjects received a single dose of KER-050 and eight subjects received a single dose of placebo, each administered subcutaneously with a 12-week safety follow-up. The subjects were enrolled in sequential single-ascending dose escalation cohorts of up to ten subjects each. In Part 2 of this trial, eight subjects received KER-050 and two received placebo, administered subcutaneously, on two occasions 28 days apart, with a 12-week safety follow-up after the second dose. In Part 2 of this trial, only one dose level was evaluated, as it was deemed to provide the necessary data, in addition to that from Part 1 of the trial, to inform the design of the Phase 2 clinical trials of KER-050 in patients with MDS and in patients with myelofibrosis.
The trial design is summarized in the figure below.
Observed tolerability data
KER-050 was well tolerated in this Phase 1 clinical trial at dose levels up to 4.5 mg/kg, the highest dose level tested, and multiple doses of 0.75 mg/kg. While one subject in the placebo group withdrew consent, there were no discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events observed in subjects in this trial were nausea, gastroenteritis, injection site erythema and, consistent with the mechanism of action of KER-050, increased hemoglobin and hypertension. The reversible, mild hypertension events were observed in subjects with an approximately 3 g/dL increase in hemoglobin.
Long half-life observed, potentially supporting monthly or less frequent dosing
We observed that KER-050 drug levels were dose proportional in Part 1 of this trial, with a mean half-life of approximately ten to 12 days. The half-life coupled with the pharmacodynamic effect observed in the hematologic parameters support the potential for administration of monthly or less frequent dosing, which we believe will decrease the burden on patients and improve compliance.
Rapid and sustained increases in mean reticulocyte counts, hemoglobin, red blood cell counts and platelet counts observed
In Part 1 of this trial, we observed rapid and sustained increases in mean reticulocyte counts, hemoglobin, red blood cell counts and platelet counts. Consistent with the underlying biology, increases in reticulocytes were observed early with increases of hemoglobin following thereafter. Increases in reticulocytes were observed as early as Day 2 and reached a peak 
around Day 15. Increases in hemoglobin concentration were also observed as early as Day 2, reached a peak around Day 29 and remained elevated for several weeks.
We also observed a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of subjects with hemoglobin increases of at least 1.5 g/dL. We believe a 1.5 g/dL increase would be considered clinically meaningful in patients with low red blood cell counts.
In addition to the changes in erythroid parameters, robust, dose-dependent increases in platelet count were observed after a single dose of KER-050. All subjects who received a 4.5 mg/kg dose of KER-050, the highest dose evaluated, demonstrated an increase of 30 x 109 cells/L or greater at any one point in the trial, which we believe would be considered clinically meaningful in patients with low platelet counts.
We believe the rapid onset and durability of increased hemoglobin and platelet count observed in our Phase 1 clinical trial supports the potential for a dual effect of KER-050 on both early-stage differentiation and terminal maturation.
Additionally, we observed reductions in follicle-stimulating hormone, a biomarker of activin inhibition, following administration of KER-050, which we believe is indicative of target engagement and activin inhibition. We also observed an increase in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, a biomarker of bone remodeling, which we believe demonstrates that KER-050 has the potential to increase bone mass.
We believe that the findings from this Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrate the translation of biological action from rodents to humans. We also believe that data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials support that treatment with KER-050 has the potential to address ineffective hematopoiesis in diseases where multiple cytopenias arise from the blockage in progression of progenitor cells to mature blood cells, such as in MDS and myelofibrosis.
KER-047: For the Treatment of Functional Iron Deficiency
We are developing KER-047, our lead small molecule product candidate, for the treatment of functional iron deficiency. We believe KER-047 is a potent and selective inhibitor of ALK2, a receptor whose excessive signaling is the underlying cause of the elevated levels of hepcidin, the key regulator of iron absorption and recycling, that leads to low iron bioavailability and anemia in a broad range of diseases. 
Hepcidin and Iron Homeostasis
Iron supply in the bone marrow is critical for erythropoiesis, as iron is an essential component of hemoglobin. Although iron is required for many functions in the body, including erythropoiesis, high iron levels are toxic, so circulating levels are regulated to avoid iron overload. To maintain this balance, absorption of dietary iron is tightly controlled and recycled iron is held in the liver and macrophages, which we refer to as the storage tissues, to be mobilized quickly when circulating iron levels are too low. These storage tissues also act to sequester away iron when levels are too high. Hepcidin, a hormone produced by the liver, is the key regulator of iron absorption and recycling, and controls both the recirculation of iron from storage tissues as well as the absorption of dietary iron from the intestine.
Hepcidin levels are upregulated through activation of the ALK2 receptor, which is a BMP receptor belonging to the broader TGF-ß family of proteins. Hepcidin levels are tightly regulated by liver cells through BMP6 signaling via ALK2. High serum iron triggers the expression of BMP6, which then acts to increase hepcidin expression, resulting in iron sequestration, decreased iron absorption and reduced serum iron. Hepcidin is controlled by a feedback loop, and serum hepcidin levels are inversely related to serum iron levels. This feedback loop prevents this system from shifting out of balance. The system is down regulated through the activity of matriptase-2, or MT-2, a cell surface protease, which is encoded by the TMPRSS6 gene. This protein reduces the ability of BMP6 to signal through ALK2. The below graphic illustrates a normal functioning of the negative feedback loop.
Regulation of Iron in the Body
Functional Iron Deficiency
Failure to suppress ALK2 signaling can result in elevated hepcidin levels, which are associated with decreased dietary iron absorption, increased iron sequestration in storage tissues and low iron bioavailability in the bone marrow. These conditions of functional iron deficiency culminate in a shortage of serum iron, which leads to insufficient red blood cell production that manifests as mild to moderate anemia.
High hepcidin levels can also be the result of genetic disease. Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia, or IRIDA, is a rare, inherited form of iron deficiency anemia that results in loss of function of MT-2, resulting in elevated ALK2 signaling and high hepcidin levels. Patients with IRIDA have the typical symptoms of anemia, including fatigue, weakness and shortness of breath, in addition to other symptoms associated with low iron. These symptoms are most pronounced during childhood, although they tend to be mild.
The prevalence of IRIDA worldwide is estimated to be less than one person in 1,000,000. IRIDA was first described in 1981 with the observation that patients with anemia were refractory to treatment with oral iron. However, the association of mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene with IRIDA was not identified until 2008, and genetic testing for IRIDA is not widely available. Furthermore, affected individuals usually have normal growth and development, so IRIDA is poorly diagnosed. All these factors contribute to an inability to accurately determine the prevalence of IRIDA.
Hepcidin levels are also elevated due to chronic inflammation in MDS and myelofibrosis, which limits the availability of iron for hemoglobin production, resulting in anemia. Red blood cell transfusions, which are used to treat anemia, can lead to iron overload and toxicity in cardiovascular and other tissues.
Limitations of Current Treatment Options for Functional Iron Deficiency
There are no current treatments that address the underlying cause of functional iron deficiency, including in patients with IRIDA and in MDS and myelofibrosis patients with functional iron deficiency. 
Patients with functional iron deficiency anemia have elevated levels of hepcidin, potentially with accompanying iron overload in multiple organ systems. This chronic iron overload can lead to multiple organ dysfunction, including in the liver, heart and endocrine. Accordingly, iron chelation therapy is used to reduce iron deposits in those organs. Iron chelators can be administered by intravenous or subcutaneous twice daily injections (deferoxamine) or taken orally once (deferasirox) to three times daily (deferiprone). While orally available chelators, particularly Deferasirox (Exjade) are currently prescribed due to their ease of administration, some patients still need to receive deferoxamine infusions. Regardless of administration profile, chelator use carries a known risk of severe side effects with several restrictions of use and black box warnings regarding potential renal, ophthalmic, hepatic and gastrointestinal, or GI, toxicity/failure, with common acute GI side effects including abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The side effect profile as well as frequency of administration and perceived bad taste are reported as drivers of poor patient compliance with this existing treatment option.
We believe that a treatment option that reestablishes normal iron homeostasis has the potential to benefit a broad range of patients with functional iron deficiency.
Our Solution: KER-047
KER-047 is an orally-available small molecule ALK2 inhibitor designed to potently inhibit ALK2 signaling, with high selectivity for ALK2 relative to other structurally-similar TGF-ß receptors as well as other kinase families.
Mechanism of Action of KER-047
We believe that KER-047 has the potential to address the underlying cause of diseases arising from functional iron deficiency by suppressing ALK2 signaling to normalize hepcidin expression and mobilize iron out of tissues. We believe this effect will result in increased iron bioavailability, resulting in restoration of the production of red blood cells and a reversal of anemia in patients with functional iron deficiency anemia and patients with IRIDA. By ameliorating anemia arising from functional iron deficiency, we believe KER-047 can potentially eliminate the need for excessive supplementary iron or IV iron treatments and avoid the adverse events associated with those treatment options. In addition, we believe KER-047, if approved, has the potential to mobilize excess iron being stored in tissues into the serum. By ameliorating the excess iron in tissues, we believe KER-047 can potentially eliminate or reduce the need for phlebotomy and/or treatment with iron chelators, while allowing patients to avoid the adverse events associated with these treatments and providing benefit to patients where the current treatment options are largely ineffective. 
Ongoing Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with IRIDA
We are conducting an open label, two-part, dose-escalation and dose-expansion Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate KER-047 in patients with IRIDA. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety of KER-047. The secondary objectives of this trial are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of KER-047. We expect to use the data from Part 1 of this trial to select the dose level and duration to be evaluated in Part 2 of this trial. The trial design is summarized in the figure below. 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial Design
In December 2022, we presented data from one patient enrolled in Cohort 1 of Part 1 of this trial who completed the 14-day treatment and washout periods, at the 64th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition. Treatment with KER-047 was generally well tolerated by this patient, with no serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities reported during treatment. There was one TEAE reported, which was determined to be unrelated to the treatment.
In this patient, hepcidin and serum ferritin levels decreased following administration of KER-047. Serum ferritin returned to baseline levels in the washout period, indicating that the effect was potentially treatment-associated. Reticulocyte hemoglobin also increased in this patient during the treatment period. Taken together, these data are suggestive of iron redistribution consistent with the mechanism of action of KER-047.
Clinical Development Strategy
We expect to report additional data from Part 1 of the Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with IRIDA in the second half of 2023. We also expect to commence an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial in MDS and myelofibrosis patients with functional iron deficiency in the first half of 2023, and expect to report initial data from this trial in the second half of 2023.
Completed Phase 1 Clinical Trial 
In November 2020, we completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-part Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate single and multiple ascending doses of KER-047 in healthy volunteers. The primary objectives of this trial were to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of KER-047. The trial design is summarized in the figure below.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial Design
Observed tolerability data 
The majority of adverse events observed in this Phase 1 clinical trial were mild or moderate in severity, and only two were severe. There were no serious adverse events reported in this trial. The most common adverse events observed in healthy volunteers in this trial were abdominal discomfort, chills, decreased appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, gastroenteritis, headache, lymphopenia, myalgia, nausea, neutropenia, pyrexia, rhinorrhea, tonsilitis, upper abdominal pain and vomiting. In Part 2 of this trial, ten of 40 participants administered KER-047 and one of 11 participants administered placebo discontinued study drug due to adverse events. Adverse events that led to study drug discontinuation in three or more participants in the KER-047 groups included lymphopenia and chills. Lymphopenia, which we believe is consistent with KER-047’s mechanism of action, was observed after multiple doses and was reversible after discontinuation of study drug.
Rapid mobilization of iron stores resulted in increased reticulocyte hemoglobin content of newly-produced immature red blood cells
In this Phase 1 clinical trial, we observed rapid, robust and sustained dose-related increases in serum iron and transferrin saturation in the volunteers who received KER-047, which was associated with decreases in ferritin, an effect that is consistent with mobilization of iron stores. 
We also observed a reduction in serum hepcidin in Cohorts 1 through 3 of Part 2 of this trial (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg dose groups), which we believe is consistent with KER-047’s mechanism of action. These data were not collected in Part 1 of this trial or in Cohort 4 of Part 2 of this trial (350 mg dose group).
Part 2 of the Trial: Hepcidin Percent Change from Baseline at Day 7, 8 Hours Post-Dose
Additionally, we observed a decrease in hepcidin as early as four hours after administration of the first dose in Cohort 5 of Part 2 of this trial (100 mg dose group). 
We also observed an increase in reticulocyte hemoglobin in Cohorts 1 through 4 of Part 2 of this trial, starting on Day 4 of treatment.
Mean Reticulocyte Hemoglobin at Each Visit
We believe the observed decrease in ferritin and hepcidin coupled with the observed increases in reticulocyte hemoglobin content are indicative of increased iron mobilization. Importantly, we believe the mobilized iron is available for incorporation into hemoglobin as evidenced by the increase in reticulocyte hemoglobin, a measure of hemoglobin content from newly-produced immature red blood cells. These erythroid precursors potentially would continue maturation into hemoglobin-rich red blood cells. 
We also observed decreases in lymphocytes following peak increases in serum iron in this trial, which we believe is consistent with KER-047’s mechanism of action and suggestive of depletion of tissue iron. 
We believe the data from this Phase 1 clinical trial support the potential for KER-047 to be developed as a treatment for functional iron deficiency.
Observed reductions in total cholesterol 
Reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, or LDL, and high-density lipoproteins were observed in Part 2 of this trial. The reductions in total cholesterol and LDL were achieved rapidly with a mean reduction of greater than 20% at the highest dose, following seven days of dosing.
Preclinical Data
KER-047 was observed in preclinical studies to be a potent and highly selective ALK2 inhibitor and to change serum iron levels. Specifically, KER-047 demonstrated in these studies:
▪selectivity for ALK2 compared to other structurally-related TGF-ß and non-TGF-ß kinases;
▪increased serum iron levels in rat studies; and
▪reversal of high hepcidin levels and low hemoglobin levels in a mouse model of IRIDA.
KER-047 observed to be a potent and highly selective ALK2 receptor inhibitor in a biochemical assay
In standard biochemical kinase screenings, KER-047 exhibited low nanomolar potency for ALK2. Under the conditions of this assay, KER-047 exhibited at least an eight-fold selectivity over the other structurally-related TGF-ß kinases. In a 370-member 
kinase panel, only two non-TGF-ß kinases were inhibited less than 75% at a KER-047 concentration of 1 µM. We believe these preclinical data further support the potency and selectivity of KER-047 for the ALK2 domain.
Highly Selective ALK2 Receptor Inhibitor
The kinase selectivity of KER-047 is shown in the dendrogram above. Compounds were screened at 1 µM against a panel of over 370 kinases and disease-relevant mutants. Each branch of the dendogram represents an individual human kinase. Kinases bound by the compound are indicated by red circles on the kinome tree. The degree of binding corresponds to the size of the circle. As illustrated by the largest red circle in the above graphic, KER-047 was observed to be a potent ALK2 inhibitor and a weak inhibitor of other members of the TGF-ß family of receptors.
In cell-based assays that more directly tested the functional ability of KER-047 to suppress receptor signaling, KER-047 exhibited low nanomolar potency. In assays evaluating the effect of KER-047 on receptors with the highest structural homology to ALK2, KER-047 had at least 20-fold selectivity for ALK2, compared to ALK1 and ALK5, which have 77% and 65% homology to ALK2, respectively.
KER-047 inhibition of ALK2 signaling resulted in increased serum iron and transferrin saturation in multiple animal models
We believe that data from preclinical studies support a link between ALK2 signaling, hepcidin expression and serum iron across multiple preclinical species in both healthy and disease models. Serum iron is an indicator of whether there is adequate iron available in the body. Total iron binding capacity is the measure of the maximum amount of iron that can be bound by transferrin, an iron-binding protein, and is a surrogate measurement of serum transferrin levels. Transferrin saturation is calculated by dividing serum iron by total iron binding capacity and is an indicator of how well the body is transporting the iron in blood. Taken together, these values are an indication of the state of iron balance in the body.
We evaluated serum iron, total iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation in Sprague-Dawley rats that received daily, oral administration of either vehicle or doses of 1 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg of KER-047 for three months. Rats that were treated with KER-047 were observed to have a dose-dependent increase in serum iron levels and a concomitant increase in transferrin saturation, with no change in total iron binding capacity.
Increased Serum Iron, Total Iron Binding Capacity and Transferrin Saturation in Rats
These data demonstrate that ALK2 inhibition resulted in increased serum iron and that KER-047 acts by releasing iron into blood without altering the expression or functionality of iron binding proteins. We believe that these data demonstrate that treatment with KER-047 has the potential to alter ALK2 signaling and release iron from storage tissue for transport to other tissues, including in the bone marrow.
Treatment with an ALK2 inhibitor closely related to KER-047 was also observed to reverse anemia in a mouse model of IRIDA. To generate this mouse model, we used an siRNA directed against TMPRSS6, the same gene that is defective in patients with IRIDA, to render the mice TMPRSS6-deficient. We confirmed that mice receiving the TMPRSS6 siRNA had a greater than 85% reduction of target gene expression relative to the control siRNA cohort. This model recapitulated the increased hepcidin levels and reduced hemoglobin that are characteristic of patients with IRIDA. Treatment of the mice receiving the TMPRSS6 siRNA with an ALK2 inhibitor normalized levels of both hepcidin gene expression and hemoglobin levels compared to the control siRNA cohort receiving vehicle treatment, which we believe indicates that ALK2 inhibition can reverse anemia resulting from iron imbalance.
Serum Hepcidin and Hemoglobin Levels in Mice with siRNA-induced IRIDA
The sequence of the ALK2 receptor has been highly conserved through evolution, with greater than 98% amino acid sequence homology between mice and humans. Likewise, the finding that the mouse models with changes in ALK2 signaling recapitulate human disease also provides evidence that the function of the ALK2 receptor is conserved across species. For 
example, knockdown of the TMPRSS6 gene results in a phenocopy of the disease observed in patients with IRIDA. We believe that the conservation of biology provides confidence that treatments that are efficacious in preclinical models will have similar effects in humans.
We further explored the results we observed in a mouse model of IRIDA by using a mouse model of anemia of inflammation via induced chronic kidney disease. Inflammatory cytokines in chronic kidney diseases results in increased hepcidin, iron imbalance and anemia, and we believe a mouse model of chronic kidney disease is predictive of the broader indication of anemia of inflammation. To generate this mouse model, mice were dosed daily for six weeks with 50 mg/kg of adenine to induce kidney damage, and subsequently developed inflammation-mediated anemia, with corresponding elevated levels of hepcidin and decreased serum iron. Thereafter, mice continued to receive either vehicle or adenine daily, but also received daily treatment of either vehicle or 5 mg/kg of an ALK2 inhibitor closely related to KER-047 for ten days. 
At termination of the preclinical study, mice receiving adenine in combination with the ALK2 inhibitor had serum iron values 108.2% higher than the vehicle-treated mice receiving adenine and vehicle. Additionally, serum hepcidin was decreased by 85.4% over vehicle-treated mice. These data substantiate the role of ALK2 signaling in anemia arising from high hepcidin and illustrate the potential therapeutic benefit of specific ALK2 inhibition in these diseases, including anemia of inflammation.

Our Pulmonary and Cardiovascular Franchise
KER-012
KER-012 is a ligand trap comprised of a modified ligand-binding domain of ActRIIB that is fused to the portion of the human antibody known as the Fc domain. KER-012 is designed to normalize blood vessel thickness and heart function by binding to and inhibiting the signaling of select TGF-ß ligands, including activin A, activin B and myostatin (GDF8), that stimulate smooth muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis, without a dose-limiting increase in red blood cells. We believe that KER-012 has the potential to increase the signaling of BMP pathways through this inhibition of activin A and activin B signaling, and consequently treat diseases such as PAH that are associated with reduced BMP signaling due to inactivating mutations in the BMP receptors. We are developing KER-012 for the treatment of PAH and for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. In May 2022, we announced preliminary topline results from Part 1 of our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating single and multiple ascending doses of KER-012 in healthy volunteers and in September 2022, we announced preliminary clinical data from the Part 2 multiple ascending dose portion of this trial. We expect to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial of KER-012 in patients with PAH in the first half of 2023 and an open-label Phase 2 biomarker clinical trial of KER-012 in the second half of 2023.
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
PAH is a debilitating disorder characterized by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance due to severe constriction and progressive obliteration of the pulmonary vessels. PAH results in diminished oxygenation, impaired cardiac output and symptoms stemming from overload of the right ventricle, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, fainting, chest pain, palpitations and swelling of extremities and abdomen. We estimate that there are approximately 40,000 addressable patients in the United States living with this condition. Despite current treatment options, survival with PAH remains only slightly above 50% at five years, with mortality typically resulting from right ventricle failure.
Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the BMP type II receptor, or BMPR2, are present in over 70% of cases of heritable PAH, or HPAH, while loss-of-function mutations in certain BMPR2 co-receptors are present in other cases of HPAH and idiopathic PAH. Histology and gene expression studies from the lungs of human and experimental PAH showed diminished BMPR2 expression and BMP signaling even in the absence of loss-of-function mutations, as well as enhanced TGF-ß signaling. Consistent with an imbalance in the signaling of these families of ligands, it was recently found that PAH due to cirrhosis and portal hypertension is marked by a severe deficiency of circulating BMP9, while circulating TGF-ß, activin and growth differentiation factor, or GDF, ligands were found to be increased in PAH, even in the absence of causative mutations. Multiple experimental third-party models also demonstrated the efficacy of augmenting BMP signaling or suppressing TGF-ß, activin or GDF signaling, which we believe supports the notion that imbalanced homeostatic BMP and pathogenic TGF-ß, activin and GDF signaling drive the development and progression of pulmonary vascular disease.
Limitations of Current Treatment Options for PAH
All of the currently-approved therapies for PAH are vasodilators, which are medications that dilate blood vessels. These vasodilators fall into one of three categories: (i) prostanoids, which are agonists of the prostacyclin signaling pathway; (ii) endothelin receptor antagonists, or ERAs; or (iii) (a) phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, or PDE5i, which are agents that enhance nitric oxide metabolism, or (b) soluble guanylate cyclase activators, which cause downstream cGMP signaling.
One common approach to treating early-stage or mild PAH is an oral combination therapy using ERA and PDE5i medications. More severe PAH generally requires the addition of prostanoid, via oral or inhaled administration, while advanced PAH typically requires continuous parenteral administration. Each of these individual therapies may modestly improve a patient’s functional status and in some cases survival, but is limited by systemic hypotension, systemic side effects and tachyphylaxis, which is an acute, sudden decrease in response to a product after its administration. Additionally, combination therapy is 
limited by the combined side effect profiles. Although existing treatments may modestly slow the progression of PAH, none appear to halt or reverse the disease’s progression.
While the key physiologic and pathologic features of PAH include vasoconstriction, scar tissue and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and inflammation, the main pharmacological effect for all currently approved therapies is believed to be vasodilation. Accordingly, we believe there is a significant unmet need for a treatment that primarily targets the proliferative pathological processes and can be used alone or in combination with other PAH therapies. We believe that potent therapies that do not exhibit tachyphylaxis, are orally bioavailable or do not require continuous infusion therapy would have advantages over the currently available treatments for PAH.
Therapies that arrest pulmonary vascular remodeling could have a long-term clinical stabilizing effect in PAH, or reverse vascular obliteration. We believe that KER-012 has the potential to increase the signaling of BMP pathways through the inhibition of activin A and activin B signaling, and consequently treat diseases such as PAH that are associated with reduced BMP signaling due to inactivating mutations in the BMP receptors.
Completed Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Healthy Volunteers
In September 2022, we completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-part Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate single and multiple ascending doses of KER-012 in healthy volunteers. The primary objectives of this trial were safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. The trial design is summarized in the figure below.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial Design
Observed tolerability data 
KER-012 was generally well tolerated in Part 1 of this trial at dose levels up to 5 mg/kg, the highest dose level tested, when administered as a single dose, and multiple doses of 0.75 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg and 4.5 mg/kg. In Part 1 of this trial, one subject withdrew consent after receiving a single 1.5 mg/kg dose of KER-012 and did not complete the safety follow-up. In Part 2 of this trial, one subject discontinued after receiving two doses of placebo due to a serious adverse event unrelated to treatment and another subject withdrew consent after receiving two 1.5 mg/kg doses of KER-012. None of the discontinuations in this trial were due to treatment-related adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported in Part 1 of this trial. Additionally, the majority of the adverse events that were observed in this trial were mild in severity and resolved. 
Dose-dependent reductions in serum follicle-stimulating hormone observed
Suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH, was observed in both Part 1 and Part 2 of this trial. FSH, which is secreted by the pituitary, is controlled through signaling by the activin receptor and Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone, or GnRH. Approximately 50% of the FSH secretion is regulated via activin signaling and the other 50% by GnRH. Accordingly, complete inhibition of activin signaling would be expected to reduce FSH by approximately 50% in postmenopausal women, who have elevated FSH levels.
In Part 2, maximal target engagement was observed in the 4.5 mg/kg dose cohort, with five out of six volunteers who received a 4.5 mg/kg dose of KER-012 achieving a >40% reduction in serum FSH levels from baseline.
Part 2 of the Trial: FSH Percent Change from Baseline
The magnitude of FSH reduction in the highest doses tested suggest that KER-012 treatment maximally inhibited activin signaling.
Observed changes in pharmacodynamic markers were consistent with increased BMP signaling in the bone
We observed dose-dependent increases in serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase, or BSAP, a marker of osteoblast activity, with a maximal increase observed at the highest doses evaluated in this trial.
KER-012 is designed to inhibit activins and growth differentiation factor ligands in bone, which potentially results in reduced SMAD 2/3 signaling and increased signaling of the BMP pathway (SMAD 1/5/9). The increased BMP signaling potentially promotes bone formation through a dual mechanism of activation and recruitment of bone forming osteoblasts and repression of osteoclasts, as demonstrated in our preclinical studies.
In Part 2 of this trial, we observed increases in BSAP after each dose, which is supportive of activation of osteoblasts after each dose.
Part 2 of the Trial: BSAP Percent Change from Baseline
Multiple doses of KER-012 did not elicit changes in erythropoiesis
Administration of KER-012 did not elicit clinically meaningful changes in hemoglobin or red blood cells in this trial, and no changes in red blood cells were observed after the second or third dose.
Observed Mean Hemoglobin Change
Observed Mean Red Blood Cell Change
The observed lack of effect on erythropoiesis in this trial is consistent with the lack of effect observed in our multiple preclinical models.
Clinical Development Strategy
We expect to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating KER-012 in patients with PAH in the first half of 2023. We also expect to commence an open-label Phase 2 biomarker clinical trial of KER-012 in the second half of 2023.
Preclinical Data
We have generated preclinical data that we believe demonstrated proof-of-mechanism of KER-012 for the treatment of PAH and for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. Specifically, in preclinical studies, KER-012:
•Demonstrated effects on bone, including:
◦Exhibited high affinity for, and potent inhibition of, ligands involved in the regulation of bone homeostasis;
◦Increased bone mineral density and trabecular bone volume in wild-type mice and mice with established osteoporosis; and
◦Rats receiving a rodent version of KER-012, or RKER-012, were protected from hypoxia-associated bone loss.
•Demonstrated benefit in models of PAH and cardiovascular disease, including:
◦In a rat model of PAH, rats receiving RKER-012 were protected from the thickening of the right ventricular wall and had reductions in markers of inflammation and fibrosis; and
◦In a mouse model of pulmonary arterial banding, or PAB, RKER-012 was observed to protect against both the PAB-related cardiac dysfunction and remodeling.
KER-012 targeted ligands that signal through ActRIIA and ActRIIB in preclinical studies
KER-012 is a modified ActRIIB ligand trap that contains sequences from both wild-type ActRIIB and wild-type ActRIIA. In preclinical studies, KER-012 bound to and inhibited multiple ligands that signal through these cell surface receptors, including activin A, activin B and growth differentiation factor 11. These ligands are key regulators of bone remodeling that act to suppress bone growth. BMP9 is a ligand capable of signaling through the ActRIIB and bone morphogenetic receptor II. Inhibition of BMP9 results in disruption of vascular remodeling, which can lead to the development of epistaxis and telangiectasias. KER-012 did not bind BMP9 or inhibit BMP9 signaling in preclinical studies. Consequently, we believe KER-012 has the potential to avoid negative effects on vascular remodeling.
Treatment with KER-012 increased bone mineral density 
In preclinical studies conducted in wild-type mice, twice weekly intraperitoneal 20 mg/kg dosing of KER-012 increased bone mineral density compared to vehicle-treated mice 31 days post-treatment. Additionally, we observed that treatment with KER-012 statistically significantly increased trabecular bone formation and mineral apposition rate, which we believe is consistent with an anabolic effect on bone.

*** P value <0.001
In a separate preclinical study, we observed that treatment with KER-012 increased the ratio of osteoblasts, which are bone forming cells, to osteoclasts, which are bone resorbing cells, which further supports that KER-012 acts via an anabolic effect on bone. We also observed in preclinical studies conducted in mice with established osteoporosis that twice weekly intraperitoneal 20 mg/kg dosing of KER-012 increased bone mass compared to vehicle-treated mice 46 days post-treatment.

Treatment with RKER-012 prevented bone loss from hypoxia in the rat model of PAH
In the rat model of PAH, chronic hypoxia induced a catabolic state that resulted in wasting of tissue, including bone and muscle. Treatment with a subcutaneous 10 mg/kg dose of RKER-012 was observed to prevent bone loss in the rat model of PAH.

Treatment with RKER-012 prevented cardiac hypertrophy in a rat model of PAH 
We combined administration of SUGEN5416, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1/2, with exposure to chronic hypoxia to recapitulate the biology in PAH. RKER-012 was tested in this SUGEN/hypoxia, or SH, rat model of PAH. Adult male rats were subjected to SH and received either vehicle or 10 mg/kg RKER-012 twice weekly for three weeks. Rats maintained under normal oxygen conditions, or normoxic controls, received only vehicle.
Consistent with the development of cardiac and pulmonary impairment, vehicle-treated SH rats exhibited increases in Fulton index, which measures enlargement of the right ventricle (p<0.0001) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, or sPAP, (p<0.0001) relative to normoxic controls. Relative to the vehicle-treated SH rats, treatment of the SH rats with RKER-012 significantly attenuated increased Fulton index (p<0.01) and prevented an increase in sPAP (p<0.001).
Additionally, vehicle-treated SH rats exhibited increased lung inflammation/fibrosis (p<0.0001), smooth muscle hypertrophy (p<0.0001), and arteriole muscularization (p<0.0001) relative to normoxic controls, while treatment with RKER-012 reduced these pathologies (all p<0.0001, relative to vehicle). Vehicle-treated SH rats also exhibited increased expression of atrial natriuretic peptide, or ANP, and brain natriuretic peptide, or BNP (both p<0.05), relative to normoxic controls. Treatment with RKER-012 significantly reduced ANP expression (p<0.05) and trended to reduce BNP expression (p=0.11), which we believe indicates that RKER-012 could potentially reduce PAH-induced damage to the heart.
Vehicle-treated SH rats also exhibited elevated expression of genes associated with the development of PAH-associated pathology in the lung and right ventricle, both hallmarks of PAH pathology, which were reduced with RKER-012 treatment.
In a preclinical study evaluating the binding activity of KER-012, KER-012 was observed to inhibit ligands associated with endothelial dysfunction, including activins A and B, whereas KER-012 exhibited low affinity for BMP-9.
Treatment with RKER-012 prevented cardiac dysfunction and remodeling in a mouse PAB model 
We used mechanical restriction of the pulmonary artery in mice to increase pressure in the right ventricular of the heart. In this model, increased ventricular pressure resulted in cardiac dysfunction, as demonstrated by increased end systolic pressure-volume relationship, or ESPVR, and increased myocardial performance index, or MPI. The increased ventricular pressure also results in cardiac remodeling, as evidenced by an increase in the Fulton index, an increase in the right ventricular free wall thickness, or RVFWT, and increased fibrosis in the heart. Treatment with twice weekly subcutaneous 10 mg/kg dosing of RKER-012 was observed to protect against both the PAB-related cardiac dysfunction and remodeling, which we believe demonstrates that KER-012 has the potential to have a cardioprotective effect that could potentially provide benefit in diseases such as PAH and other cardiovascular diseases in patients.

Our Preclinical Pipeline
Our Proprietary Discovery Approach
We believe, based on our previous experience with ActRII ligand traps using the endogenous and wild-type sequences, that observations in preclinical rodent models have the potential to translate to humans in the clinic. Specifically:
▪Wild-type ActRIIA-Fc was associated with increased bone growth and red blood cell production in rodents and non-human primates. In a third-party clinical trial of ActRIIA-Fc, increased bone mineral density and red blood cell production was reported in healthy post-menopausal women. In this clinical trial, it was also reported that lower doses elicited the effect on red blood cells compared to bone, and thus, the dominant effect on red blood cell production prevented development in diseases with bone loss.
▪In third-party preclinical studies in rodents and non-human primates, ActRIIB-Fc was associated with increased bone mineral density and lean muscle mass, but was not associated with changes in red blood cells. However, ActRIIB-Fc was also observed to cause nose and gum bleeding, which we believe is due to its effect of disrupting normal vascular remodeling. BMP9 signaling is required for normal vascular remodeling, but is not involved in regulation of muscle or bone tissues. ActRIIB-Fc potently inhibits BMP9 signaling, which is the mechanism behind the bleeding events observed with ActRIIB-Fc treatment.
We have developed a proprietary library of ActRII ligand traps by combining sequences from ActRIIA and ActRIIB. We have engineered molecules that are designed to have the therapeutic properties of either or both parent molecules without the dose-limiting effect on red blood cells observed with ActRIIA-Fc or the negative effect on blood vessels observed with wild-type ActRIIB-Fc. Our ActRII program has produced a broader pipeline of engineered ligand traps and currently contains more than 20 unique variants in preclinical development. These include:
▪Molecules designed to increase bone mass without the dose-limiting effect on red blood cells observed with wild-type ActRIIA-Fc; and
▪Molecules designed to increase muscle and bone mass with reduced BMP9 binding without impacting vascular remodeling that leads to weak blood vessels observed with the wild-type ActRIIB-Fc.
Our discovery approach has built on these initial observations to generate product candidates designed to target ActRII receptors without the liabilities observed in third-party preclinical studies and clinical trials of ActRIIA-Fc and ActRIIB-Fc.
We nominated KER-065, a preclinical asset, out of this proprietary library of ActRII ligand traps for further investigation. KER-065 is a novel ligand trap comprised of a modified ligand-binding domain derived from ActRIIA and ActRIIB that is fused to the portion of the human antibody known as the Fc domain. KER-065 is designed to bind to and inhibit TGF-ß ligands, including myostatin (GDF8) and activin A, which are negative regulators of muscle mass and strength. Through inhibition of these TGF-ß ligands, we believe that KER-065 has the potential to induce a muscle anabolic effect. KER-065 is also designed to inhibit TGF-ß ligands involved in bone remodeling, fat metabolism and fibrosis.
We believe that we are well positioned to advance our product candidates and realize the commercial opportunities in diseases where muscle and bone loss result in a debilitating impact on survival and quality of life, if our product candidates are successfully developed and approved. Our deep knowledge and expertise of the TGF-ß family of proteins provides a streamlined approach to screen and develop novel product candidates for hematological, pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders.

Manufacturing 
We rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates.
We have engaged CMOs to manufacture supply for preclinical and clinical use. Additional CMOs are used to label, package and distribute drug product for preclinical and clinical use. We obtain our supplies from these CMOs on a purchase order basis and do not have any long-term supply arrangements in place. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. We have been and are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to procure sufficient supplies for the development of our product candidates, and are working with our CMOs to manage this process. However, we could be unable to find alternative suppliers of acceptable quality, in the appropriate volumes and at an acceptable cost, if needed. As our development programs expand and we build new process efficiencies, we expect to continually evaluate this strategy with the objective of satisfying demand for registration trials and, if approved, the manufacture, sale and distribution of commercial products.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary rights. While we believe that our product candidates, discovery programs, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we compete in the highly competitive markets and face significant competition from many sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies and private and public research institutions.
We compete in the segments of the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other related industries that develop and market therapies for the treatment of hematological, pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders. There are many other companies, including large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, that have commercialized and/or are developing therapies for the same therapeutic areas that our product candidates target. For example, FibroGen Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc. are developing product candidates for the treatment of anemia, and Acceleron Pharma Inc. (which was acquired by Merck & Co. Inc. in November 2021), or Acceleron, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Disc Medicine are developing product candidates targeting diseases associated with MDS and myelofibrosis, including chronic anemia. Additionally, in April 2020, Acceleron received FDA approval of its product, Reblozyl, for the treatment of anemia failing an erythropoiesis stimulating agent and requiring two or more red blood cell units over eight weeks in adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk MDS with ring sideroblasts or with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis. In June 2020, Acceleron further announced that the European Commission approved Reblozyl for the treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia in adult patients with MDS or beta thalassemia and in September 2020, Acceleron announced that Health Canada approved Reblozyl for the treatment of adult patients with red blood cell transfusion-dependent anemia associated with beta thalassemia. Geron Corporation is developing imetelstat as a treatment for MDS and for myelofibrosis. Sierra Oncology (which was acquired by GSK plc in July 2022) is developing momelotinib as a treatment for myelofibrosis. Additionally, Constellation Pharmaceutics, Inc. (which was acquired by MorphoSys AG in July 2021) is also developing a product candidate as a treatment for myelofibrosis, and Incyte Corporation is developing an ALK2 inhibitor product candidate for the treatment of myelofibrosis. In March 2022, CTI BioPharma Corp. received FDA accelerated approval of its product, pacritinib (Vonjo), for the treatment of adults with intermediate or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis with a platelet count below 50 × 109/L. 
Other companies that are developing product candidates that are designed to target the TGF-ß signaling pathways include Scholar Rock Holding Corporation, Biogen Inc. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
All of the currently-approved therapies for PAH are vasodilators, which are medications that dilate blood vessels. However, Acceleron is developing sotatercept, an activin receptor ligand trap, for the treatment of PAH. Aerovate Therapeutics, Inc. and Gossamer Bio, Inc. are also developing clinical-stage product candidates, AV-101 and seralutinib, respectively, for the treatment of PAH.
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future, either alone or with their strategic collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies or universities and research institutions. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling patients for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products, if approved. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

We also plan to rely, in part, on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions if and when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we own or may obtain in the future; and to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Intellectual property rights may not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage 
As of February 28, 2023, our patent portfolio consisted of nine issued U.S. patents, 27 pending U.S. patent applications, eight issued ex-U.S. patents and 88 pending ex-U.S. applications, with expected expiry dates not earlier than between March 13, 2029 and November 10, 2043. Of these, nine issued patents and 81 patent applications relate to KER-050, KER-047 and KER-012, and eight issued patents and 34 patent applications relate to other technologies, in each case as described in more detail below. Each of our pending international patent applications has been filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and has not yet entered any national jurisdictions. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that may be commercially important to the development of our business.
We seek U.S. and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, and own patent applications with claims directed to ActRIIA ligand traps, ActRIIB ligand traps, ActRII chimera ligand traps, GDNF fusion polypeptides, ALK2 antibodies, crystal forms of an ALK2 inhibitor, and uses thereof. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets, and that may be used to manufacture and develop novel products. We are a party to license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our product candidates and in manufacturing our product candidates. 
Patent applications directed to our most advanced programs are summarized below. 
KER-050 
KER-050 is a modified ActRIIA ligand trap that is designed to bind to different TGF-ß ligands that signal through a TGF-ß signaling pathway. We own three issued U.S. patents, three issued ex-U.S. patents, 11 pending U.S. patent applications and 39 pending ex-U.S. applications that contain claims or supporting disclosure directed to ActRIIA ligand traps and use thereof to treat muscle disease, bone disease, metabolic disease, anemia, fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia, among others.

Intellectual Property Protection 
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our product candidates or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future product candidates may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to March 16, 2013 in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO, to determine priority of invention. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
Government Regulation 
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drug and biological products such as those we are developing. 
Our product candidates are subject to regulation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. 
U.S. Drug and Biological Product Regulation 
Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a New Drug Application, or NDA, or a Biologics License Application, or BLA. The process required by the FDA before biopharmaceutical product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
▪completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements; 
▪submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
▪approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial may be initiated; 
▪performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product for each proposed indication and to establish the safety, purity and potency of the investigational biologic product candidate for each proposed indication; 
▪preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA for a small molecule product candidate or a BLA for a biologic after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
▪payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA or BLA; 
▪a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA or BLA to file the application for review; 
▪satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product will be produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s continued identity, strength, quality and purity; 
▪potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; 
▪satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
▪FDA review and approval of an NDA or licensure of a BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA Advisory Committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product for particular indications for use in the United States; and 
▪compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
Preclinical and Clinical Development 
Before testing any drug or biologic candidate in humans in the United States, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. 
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The IND submission contains the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as results of in vitro and animal studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. These investigators are generally physicians who are not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety and assessing efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the existing IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also 
approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries. 
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the United States. 
Human clinical trials in the United States are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
▪Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
▪Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in a limited population of disease-affected patients to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. 
▪Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites and are designed to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
When these phases overlap or are combined, the trials may be referred to as Phase 1/2 or Phase 2/3. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial is a human trial that investigates both safety and preliminary efficacy of an investigational therapy. A Phase 2/3 clinical trial is a human trial that investigates both preliminary and confirmatory efficacy and safety to potentially support submission of a marketing application with the applicable regulatory authorities. 
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies, are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition to FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. FDA requires diversity plans to ensure that clinical trials aim to include broad racial and ethnic exposure data. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. 
FDA Review Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA. The NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application must include all relevant data 
available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each submission of an NDA or BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product application also includes a non-orphan indication. 
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within sixty days of receipt. Such decision could include either issue a refusal to file letter or acceptance of the NDA or BLA for filing, indicating that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. 
Once an NDA or BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA aims to review standard applications within ten months from the filing date, during which it will complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, or within six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. In both standard and priority reviews, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective, or for a biologic, safe, pure and potent for its intended use, and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. 
The FDA generally accepts data from foreign clinical trials in support of an NDA or BLA if the trials were conducted under an IND, and the IND requirements, unless waived, were met. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA nevertheless may accept the data in support of an NDA or BLA if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCPs and the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if deemed necessary. Although the FDA generally requests that marketing applications be supported by some data from domestic clinical studies, the FDA may accept foreign data as the sole basis for marketing approval if (1) the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, (2) the trials were performed by clinical investigators with recognized competence, and (3) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection or, if the FDA considers the inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. 
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of the advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be manufactured, the FDA will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA or BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the application in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification, which may include the potential requirement for additional clinical studies, including the potential requirement to conduct additional clinical trial(s) and/or to complete other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, or to conduct additional preclinical studies or manufacturing activities. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies 
identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
Orphan Drug Designation 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application fee. 
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
Post-Approval Requirements 
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to monitoring and record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, compliance with advertising and promotion requirements, which include restrictions on promoting the product for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label use,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Further, after approval, if there are any changes or modifications to the approved product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA review and approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
▪restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
▪fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
▪refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
▪product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; 
▪consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
▪mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
▪the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
▪injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, only a handful of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, although numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the civil False Claims Act, U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and similar foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse, transparency and privacy laws. 
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including stock options. The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and others on the other hand. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration, such as consulting agreements, that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
Civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the civil False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. 
HIPAA created additional federal civil and criminal liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearing houses and health plans, and individuals and entities that provide services on their behalf that involve individually identifiable health information, known as business associates, as well as their covered subcontractors, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to certain payments and other transfers of value made in the prior year to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members.
We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor, state laws which require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state and local laws which require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws which require the reporting of information related to drug pricing, state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product, if approved, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product 
will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by third-party payors. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. 
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. No regulatory authority has granted approval for a personalized cancer immunotherapy based on a vaccine approach, and there is no model for reimbursement of this type of product. 
Healthcare Reform 
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded healthcare programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. 
The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, which started on January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is unclear how any such challenges and additional healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect through 2031, unless additional action is taken by Congress. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Another sequester, the PAYGO Sequester, effective with the passage of the American Rescue Plan, will add another 4% reduction in Medicare spending in 2023, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, Congress is considering additional health reform measures as part of the other reform measures.
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, and subject drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” for such drugs and biologics under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates with respect to certain drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Additional Regulation 
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations. 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations.
