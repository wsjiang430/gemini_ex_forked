ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging our proprietary methionine aminopeptidase 2, or MetAP2, biology platform to develop novel therapies for patients affected by complex metabolic diseases. We have pioneered the study of MetAP2 inhibitors in both common and rare metabolic disorders and we are currently advancing programs for type 2 diabetes, Prader-Willi syndrome, or PWS, and liver diseases. 
 Our lead product candidate is ZGN-1061, a novel fumagillin-class MetAP2 inhibitor administered by subcutaneous injection, which is currently being profiled for its utility in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a prevalent, chronic, progressive, multifactorial disease that leads to increased microvascular and macrovascular disease, and as such, increases risk of death from cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Type 2 diabetes is also a leading cause of lower-limb amputation and blindness. Existing treatments, while effective in reducing blood glucose levels, fail to reduce progression of the disease, which is driven by loss of function of insulin-producing beta cells and by loss of sensitivity to insulin action. It is estimated that approximately one-third of patients with type 2 diabetes progress to needing insulin (recently estimated to be a $20.0 billion market based on annual sales). New therapies are needed to improve glycemic control and reduce comorbidities of type 2 diabetes. 
 We conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial for ZGN-1061 in Australia and New Zealand, which was designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and glucose-lowering efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes otherwise poorly controlled with non-insulin agents. The clinical trial met all of its primary objectives at the 1.8 mg dose, which included glycemic control, or change in A1C, and safety and tolerability. The 12-week data demonstrated that treatment with the 1.8 mg dose of ZGN-1061 produced substantially more improvement in A1C than a placebo dose. Progressive and notable reduction in body weight also occurred in patients treated with the highest dose tested (1.8 mg) versus placebo. The data showed a favorable tolerability profile for ZGN-1061, with no treatment-related serious adverse events and no cardiovascular, or CV, safety signals observed.
 Adverse events were primarily mild or moderate in severity, with no noted trends by dose or type of adverse event reported. We expect to report full results of the Phase 2 clinical trial at an upcoming medical meeting in 2019. 
 We received a letter from the FDA placing a full clinical hold on the investigational new drug application, or IND, for the first U.S. clinical trial of ZGN-1061. The FDA cited the possibility of CV safety risk based on our prior compound and outlined multiple potential paths for moving forward, including nonclinical or clinical options, to address these concerns in the ongoing development of ZGN-1061. We are assessing these options and a possible path forward and plan to request a Type A meeting with the FDA. The ex-U.S. Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of ZGN-1061 have been completed with no CV safety signals.
 We have also initiated development of a second MetAP2 development candidate, ZGN-1258, which is administered by subcutaneous injection. We initiated IND enabling nonclinical activities in the first quarter of 2018, in preparation for filing an IND with the FDA. However, in March 2019, we announced our decision to suspend plans to file an IND for ZGN-1258 in order to evaluate an unexpected finding in muscle tissue in four- and six-month long-term rodent toxicology studies. Nonclinical data showed degeneration and other anomalies in rat muscle tissue to different degrees in both vehicle and dose arms of the studies. The effects were absent from other animal species in long term models, and importantly, this observed finding is specific to ZGN-1258 and is not related to effects seen with any prior compound. We are taking the necessary steps to assess the unexpected effects we observed. We will continue to evaluate ZGN-1258, as well as explore other potential options within our portfolio of MetAP2 inhibitors, to address the devastating hyperphagia experienced by those with PWS. We continue to have a commitment to people with PWS and their families and we will continue to evaluate ZGN-1258 as well as explore other potential options within our portfolio of MetAP2 inhibitors.
 PWS is a rare and complex genetic disorder characterized by physiologic, cognitive and behavioral symptoms including hyperphagia, uncontrollable hunger and its related behaviors, and obesity. Published population studies estimate that the prevalence of PWS in the United States and in the European Union, or EU, ranges from 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 50,000.

The physiological drive to eat in patients with PWS is so powerful that they will go to great lengths to eat large quantities of food, even if it is spoiled, indigestible or unpalatable to others. Unsupervised patients will often eat to the point that it causes serious physical harm or death. As a result, caregivers are often forced to place locks and alarms on refrigerators and pantries that contain food. Despite attempts to control the access to food, the typical adult patient with PWS is morbidly obese and, based on evaluation of published survival data, has an average life expectancy of 32 years of age. Unfortunately, neither dietary intervention nor currently available pharmaceutical therapies bring meaningful benefits to patients with PWS and, as a result, they experience severe and life-threatening consequences of their condition. Furthermore, existing surgical techniques such as bariatric surgery are contraindicated in PWS, as patients with PWS often overeat to a point whereby they can rupture their stomachs, which is frequently a cause of death in this patient population. 
 We have launched a co-sponsored four-year natural history study to advance understanding of the medical history of and medical events in people with PWS. PATH for PWS, is our natural history study conducted in collaboration with the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research, or FPWR, is independent of any specific development program and continues enrollment, with more than 400 of the 500-participant goal enrolled as of March 2019. The study is a non-interventional, observational study to evaluate occurrences of serious medical events in PWS, intended to inform development and clinical trial design for potential new treatments for PWS. The new ZGN-1258 findings do not impact the conduct of this study or our support of PATH for PWS. 
 Both ZGN-1061 and ZGN-1258 were discovered by our researchers as part of a multi-year campaign to identify highly potent and effective novel compounds with nonclinical safety profiles supportive of continued development. One core element of focus for optimization was to reduce or eliminate the potential for pro-thrombotic effects, a limiting factor that led to termination of development of our first-generation compound. To date, both new compounds have similar intrinsic potency against the MetAP2 enzyme and display appropriate activity in animal models of type 2 diabetes and obesity. We have observed degeneration and other anomalies in muscle tissue in rodent toxicology studies of ZGN-1258 as noted above. These effects were absent from other animal species in long term models and this finding has not been observed in any of our other MetAP2 inhibitors and appears to be specific to ZGN-1258.
 In 2017, we also initiated development of a third, highly optimized MetAP2 development candidate, ZGN-1345, which is administered via the oral route and is targeted to the liver. During the fourth quarter of 2018 we announced that ZGN-1345 has been formally advanced to development candidate stage as a differentiated third asset within our pipeline. Nonclinical models have shown positive preliminary results in multiple liver disease indications. Further nonclinical studies are ongoing.
 Populations of Interest 
 Type 2 Diabetes 
 According to the International Diabetes Federation, in 2017, 425 million adults (20 – 79 years old) worldwide were living with type 2 diabetes and that number is projected to increase to 693 million adults by 2045. In the United States alone, the Center for Disease Control estimated that there were 30 million adults living with diabetes and an estimated 84 million adults were pre-diabetic in 2017. Standard therapies for type 2 diabetes include physician recommended diet and exercise, oral hypoglycemic drugs such as biguanides, or metformin, through to a number of insulin options. Metformin is most often the first line pharmacotherapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes primarily due to the extensive experience, low cost and favorable benefit risk associated with it. While metformin is likely to remain the initial treatment choice for patients with type 2 diabetes, these patients often progress to using additional treatments with oral anti-diabetes medications, such as sulfonylureas, DPP4 inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors as second line agents; injectable therapeutics, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulin are often added as third and fourth line agents, along with various combination products. We expect that ZGN-1061, if approved, will compete within the type 2 diabetes injectable space with third line agents. It is estimated that 40-45% of patients with type 2 diabetes progress to needing insulin (estimated to be a $20.0 billion market) and that therapeutics have attained an 80% penetration rate into the diagnosed group of patients. The objective of each is to maintain a daily blood glucose level range recommended by the patient’s physician, and to reach a therapeutic target of 7%, which is the U.S. goal (6.5% in Europe) glycated hemoglobin A1C, or A1C. Each of the current therapies alone has its limitations including numerous side effects. These side effects and the availability of a high number of treatment options, combined with the difficulty in daily management of glucose levels despite these treatments, creates a number of opportunities for a new third line agent to positively impact the unmet medical need. 
 We believe the diabetes drug market is estimated to be $35.0 billion and is on pace to grow to more than $71.0 billion by 2024. Pharmaceutical companies have been investigating new approaches to treating diabetes and market value has been maintained in the industry due to the introduction of these new products. We believe that ZGN-1061 MetAP2 inhibition serves the purpose of re-establishing balance to the ways the body stores and metabolizes fat and glucose. MetAP2 inhibitors

reduce the production of new fatty acid molecules by the liver and help convert stored fats into useful energy, while reducing hunger. In the setting of type 2 diabetes, these processes lead to improvement of glycemic control.

 Prader-Willi Syndrome
 PWS is the most common known genetic cause of life-threatening obesity. PWS is a rare and complex non-inherited genetic disorder, which results from abnormalities of the fifteenth chromosome. Symptoms associated with PWS are believed to result, in part, from a defect in the hypothalamus, an important supervisory center in the brain that controls many important bodily functions, such as hunger, metabolism of fats and carbohydrates, regulation of the sleep-wake cycle and expression of emotions. 
 Beginning in childhood, the brain of a patient with PWS fails to regulate metabolism and appetite normally. As a result, the vast majority of patients with PWS suffer from hyperphagia and obesity. Patients with PWS are constantly preoccupied with food and suffer from an unrelenting and overriding physiological drive to eat. Hyperphagia, a leading symptom of PWS, has a significant negative impact on the patients’ quality of life and drives obesity and a range of associated co-morbidities. Normal satiety, or the feeling of fullness after eating, does not exist in a person with PWS. The physiological drive to eat is so powerful and overwhelming that most patients with PWS will go to great lengths to eat large quantities of food, even if it is spoiled, indigestible, or unpalatable to others. Furthermore, patients with PWS have a reduced propensity for nausea and vomiting. In addition to obesity, a variety of other symptoms can be associated with PWS, including cognitive challenges, intellectual disabilities, growth hormone deficiency/short stature, low sensitivity to pain, hypersomnolence, or excessive sleepiness, and infertility due to hypogonadism, or insufficient production of sex hormones. 
 Hyperphagia impairs a PWS patient’s ability to live independently, requiring costly and constant supervision to prevent overeating. Without supervision, patients are likely to die prematurely as a result of choking, stomach rupture or tissue necrosis, or from complications caused by morbid obesity, such as heart failure or respiratory failure; in addition, preliminary data suggests that patients with PWS may be at a higher risk of death from pulmonary embolism than the general population. 
 7

Based on our evaluation of published survival data, the average life expectancy of patients with PWS is approximately 32 years of age. While a small number of patients with PWS are cared for in costly group homes, the majority of patients with PWS live in environments where caregivers often place locks and alarms on cabinets and refrigerators that contain food to impede a PWS patient’s efforts to obtain food at all times. We estimate the typical annual cost of treating a patient with PWS is $100,000 to $200,000, excluding the often significant costs of drug therapies related to other medical and psychological conditions, and the costs of any lost time from work experienced by their families due to responsibilities related to the care of a patient with PWS. 
 Published population studies estimate that the prevalence of PWS in the United States and in the EU ranges from 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 50,000. PWS is diagnosed at an early age, typically in the first year of life. We believe that, due to the severity of the condition and its unique attributes, the vast majority of patients affected by PWS are therefore diagnosed. We believe that approximately 40-50% of patients with PWS are 12 years of age or older. 
 Although there are pharmacological treatments for various symptoms of PWS, such as replacement of human growth hormone in patients with PWS that are deficient in growth hormone, based on our discussions with physicians who treat patients with PWS, there are currently no effective pharmacological treatments for obesity and hyperphagia in PWS. For example, bariatric surgery, a type of weight-loss surgery, is contraindicated in patients with PWS due to poor outcomes related to an increased risk of rupture of the reduced stomach in the setting of sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass procedures, or rupture of the restricted esophagus in the setting of gastric banding procedures with the consequence of life-threatening gastric perforation. Apart from restricted access to food and constant supervision to prevent both life-threatening overeating and morbid obesity, there is currently no treatment for obesity and hyperphagia in patients with PWS. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our current strategy is to significantly improve the health and well-being of patients affected by both prevalent metabolic and rare diseases including type 2 diabetes, PWS and potentially other metabolically related disorders. Key elements of our strategy include: 

• | Advance the clinical development of MetAP2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We believe the patient population of type 2 diabetes would benefit from MetAP2 inhibitor treatment through concomitant improvements in glycemic control and body weight. These benefits were noted in our Phase 2 clinical trial of ZGN-1061, which studied the compound in patients with type 2 diabetes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the knowledge of our experienced team of drug developers that have deep expertise in the function of MetAP2 inhibitors and metabolic diseases. Our management team has deep expertise in type 2 diabetes, PWS, obesity and related metabolic diseases, the function of MetAP2 inhibitors, the strengths and weaknesses of current treatments for type 2 diabetes and obesity and the ability to recognize the potential of novel therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Our team is complemented by highly experienced external consultants and collaborators in the areas of drug discovery, development and regulatory approval. Based on our experience in MetAP2 inhibitor development, we are exploring new chemical approaches to identify new molecules targeting the liver for treatment of metabolic liver diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH.

• | Maintain flexibility in commercializing and maximizing the value of our research programs. While we intend to develop ZGN-1061 for indications such as type 2 diabetes and other metabolically related disorders, we may enter into strategic relationships with biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to realize the full value of ZGN-1061. Additionally, we are evaluating ZGN-1061 for development in other indications. We intend to develop and commercialize ZGN-1258 in the United States (if our further evaluation of ZGN-1258 warrants continued development and commercialization) and other major market countries for PWS.

About ZGN-1061 
 ZGN-1061 was discovered by our researchers as part of a multi-year campaign to identify novel compounds that avoided limiting nonclinical safety concerns observed with our first-generation compound. The compound has similar potency and range of desired pharmacological activities in animal models as other MetAP2 inhibitors, including beloranib. Additionally, ZGN-1061 displays significantly improved safety margins in nonclinical studies, supporting the value of the compound as a more highly optimized drug product candidate. 
 ZGN-1061 acts through potent inhibition of MetAP2, an enzyme that modulates the activity of key cellular processes that control metabolism. MetAP2 inhibitors work, at least in part, by directing MetAP2 binding to cellular stress and growth factor mediators, thereby reducing the tone of signals that drive lipid synthesis by the liver and fat storage throughout the 
 8

body. In this manner, MetAP2 inhibition serves the purpose of re-establishing balance to the ways the body stores and metabolizes fat and glucose. MetAP2 inhibitors reduce the production of new fatty acid molecules by the liver and help convert stored fats into useful energy, while stimulating use of glucose and fats as an energy source. In the setting of type 2 diabetes, these processes lead to improvement of glycemic control. 
 During nonclinical development of ZGN-1061, we conducted research to understand the imbalance of thrombotic events observed in the course of beloranib clinical development. This research identified biomarkers associated with activation of blood clotting that subsequently were confirmed to be impacted in the setting of beloranib treatment in animals and cultured human endothelial cells. Further, beloranib was found to be retained in cultured endothelial cells, even after wash out, an effect that is related to the chemical structure of the compound. Modifying the side chain, as was done with ZGN-1061, leads to altered endothelial cell residence time and greatly reduces the ability of the compounds to impact endothelial cell replication, the display of pro-and anti-coagulant factors and the acceleration of clot formation, particularly following short-term exposure. Before committing ZGN-1061 to clinical development, the compound was evaluated for its potential to augment blood clotting in these same models and was found to be inactive with respect to thrombosis at doses greater than 90 times the anticipated clinical exposure.
 About ZGN-1258
 ZGN-1258 was also discovered by our researchers as part of a multi-year campaign to identify novel compounds that avoided limiting nonclinical safety concerns observed with our first-generation compound. The compound has similar potency and range of desired pharmacological activities in animal models as other MetAP2 inhibitors, including beloranib. ZGN-1258 displays significantly improved safety margins in nonclinical studies, supporting the value of the compound as a highly optimized drug product candidate. We have suspended our plans to file an IND for ZGN-1258 in order to evaluate ZGN-1258 following an unexpected finding in muscle tissue in rodent toxicology studies.
About ZGN-1345
 ZGN-1345 is our newly advanced early development candidate as a novel oral, liver-focused, MetAP2 inhibitor. In nonclinical studies, the compound has been shown to have a high degree of specificity of MetAP2 inhibition in the liver. High MetAP2 levels strongly correlate with more severe outcomes in advanced liver disease such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, nonclinical models have shown positive preliminary results in multiple liver disease indications, including NASH. Further nonclinical studies and early development activities are ongoing. 
Mechanism of Action 
 First-generation MetAP2 inhibitors, such as beloranib, were evaluated for their potential for treating obesity following publication of studies in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2002 showing anti-obesity efficacy in animals treated with a prototype MetAP2 inhibitor. These studies showed that MetAP2 inhibitor treatment was associated with loss of fat tissue accompanied by an increase in fat oxidation, indicating a redirection of fuel usage toward utilization of stored fats as a source of energy. Reduced food intake was also observed in treated animals, suggesting either direct effects of the agent on central feeding regulation or activation of a feedback loop linking the release and oxidation of stored fat to appetite. 
 In 2004, the MetAP2 inhibitor fumagillin was shown to induce a novel protein-protein interaction involving MetAP2 and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1, or ERK1, a cell stress- and growth factor-stimulated kinase. This complex reduces the activation state of ERK1. A 2005 publication in Diabetes showed that animals lacking ERK1 resist both high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, supporting the hypothesis that attenuation of ERK activity could be an important component of the beneficial metabolic effects of MetAP2 inhibitor treatment. Additionally, several hormones well-documented to be involved in energy metabolism are affected by MetAP2 inhibitors, including leptin, adiponectin and fibroblast growth factor-21, or FGF-21. These hormones are thought to contribute to the weight-reducing effects of MetAP2 inhibitors like ZGN-1061, and also are known to be involved in control of body weight, fat metabolism and glucose metabolism. More recently, we have found that the MetAP2 may also interact with elongation initiation factor 2 alpha, or eIF2α, an important regulator of protein translation. Through this mechanism, we believe that MetAP2 inhibition may trigger a beneficial cell stress response that sequesters energy from fat stores, thus increasing tissue energy metabolism. This series of mechanistic effects leads to rapid and sustained reduction of excess body weight with ZGN-1061 treatment, such as has been observed in animal studies and our clinical trial experience to date.

 Clinical Trials 
 Below is a summary of the Phase 1 clinical trial that was completed with ZGN-1061, and the Phase 2 clinical trial for which positive topline results were reported in January 2019. 
Phase 1 Clinical Trial 
 The ZGN-1061 Phase 1 clinical trial, ZAF-1061-101, was a randomized, double-blind (subject, principal investigator and site staff), placebo-controlled trial consisting of a single ascending dose, or SAD, phase and a multiple ascending dose, or MAD, phase. The SAD phase was designed to assess effects of ZGN-1061 at six ascending dose levels relative to placebo in male or female healthy volunteers with a body mass index, or BMI, of 23 to <30 kg/m2 (normal weight or overweight individuals). The MAD phase assessed effects of twice-weekly subcutaneous injections (eight doses in total) of ZGN-1061 over four weeks at three ascending dose levels relative to placebo, in male or female healthy volunteers with BMI 27-40 kg/m2 (overweight or obese individuals). In addition to conventional safety and pharmacokinetic assessments, exploratory pharmacodynamic endpoints were also assessed. These measures were intended to provide a preliminary assessment of the potential of ZGN-1061 for weight management and inform the Phase 2 clinical trial design. 
 In this clinical trial, ZGN-1061 was rapidly absorbed and cleared with no evidence of pro-thrombotic effects. ZGN-1061 was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events, or SAEs, and no severe adverse events, or AEs. There were no AEs leading to early withdrawal from the clinical trial. Treatment with ZGN-1061 resulted in improvements across multiple metabolic measures. 
 Phase 2 Clinical Trial
 The ZGN-1061 Phase 2 clinical trial, ZAF-1061-201, is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled evaluation of ZGN-1061 at 0.05 mg, 0.3 mg, 0.9 mg, and 1.8 mg or placebo administered subcutaneously every three days for 12 weeks in overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoints assessed safety and glycemic efficacy (HbA1c) for ZGN-1061 relative to placebo, and an array of secondary endpoints were included that investigated effects on supportive measures of glycemic efficacy, body weight and associated metabolic measures, exploratory biomarkers, pharmacokinetics, and patient reported outcomes. The trial was conducted through two sequential cohorts of evaluation. The first cohort included 129 individuals who were administered 0.05 mg, 0.3 mg, or 0.9 mg ZGN-1061 or placebo (1:1:1:1) and the second cohort included 46 participants who were administered 0.9 mg or 1.8 mg of ZGN-1061 or placebo (1:2:1). The clinical trial was conducted at 23 study sites in Australia and New Zealand. 
 Overall, all doses of ZGN-1061 were generally safe and well-tolerated, with an adverse event profile generally comparable to placebo. Adverse events were
 primarily mild or moderate in severity, with no noted trends by dose or type of AE reported. The most frequent treatment emergent AEs were injection site bruising, upper respiratory tract infection, and diarrhea; each of these categories of events occurred with relatively similar incidences to placebo. Three patients withdrew early due to an adverse event (injection site urticaria, 1.8 mg; upper abdominal pain, 0.9 mg; sensory disturbance, 0.05 mg). 
 10

Three patients (all 0.9 mg) reported serious AEs (upper abdominal pain, skin ulcer, anaphylactic reaction to antibiotic) and there were no deaths. There were no meaningful elevations in mean D-dimer concentrations, a robust and validated biomarker of blood clotting, across the dosing groups as compared to baseline or placebo and no CV safety signals observed. There were no meaningful changes among other clinical laboratory measures, vital signs, electrocardiograms, or measures pertaining to sleep latency (a common observation with our first-generation MetAP2 inhibitor) with ZGN-1061.
Treatment with ZGN-1061 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in A1C for 0.9 mg and 1.8 mg versus placebo at Week 12 (p=0.0003 and p<0.0001, respectively), with a 1.1% reduction in A1C at the 1.8 mg dose relative to placebo. A1C levels continued to decline with no waning of effect for both doses through Week 12. Progressive weight reduction was also observed at the 1.8 mg dose (p=0.0002), with placebo-corrected weight loss of 2.3 kg (5.1 pounds) seen at Week 12 with no evidence of waning effect. Significant improvements were observed across multiple secondary efficacy endpoints and various relevant metabolic biomarkers, as well which will be presented at a later date as part of the full trial results.
 Next Steps
 We received a letter from the FDA in November 2018 placing a full clinical hold on the IND for the first U.S. clinical trial of ZGN-1061, our second-generation, investigational MetAP2 inhibitor currently in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The FDA cited the possibility of CV safety risk based on our prior compound and outlined multiple potential paths for moving forward, including nonclinical or clinical options, to address these concerns in the ongoing development of ZGN-1061. We are assessing these options and a possible path forward and plan to request a Type A meeting with the FDA. The ex-U.S. Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of ZGN-1061 have been completed with no CV safety signals.
Nonclinical 
 ZGN-1061
 We have conducted toxicology studies with ZGN-1061in support of clinical development. Based on the nonclinical assessment, ZGN-1061 is not genotoxic. Dose selection and precautions for our completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials have been informed by nonclinical toxicology studies. Toxicological studies of up to nine months using intermittent dosing have established no observed adverse effect levels at higher exposures relative to the anticipated human doses. Embryofetal toxicity studies in multiple species have also been completed and suggest that there is a potential risk for the developing embryo or fetus to patients who are pregnant at exposure above that anticipated in the clinic; therefore, appropriate birth control and avoidance of pregnant persons within the clinical trial is mandatory. 
 ZGN-1258
 We have initiated GLP toxicology studies to support filing an IND application with the FDA for ZGN-1258. However, in March 2019, we announced our decision to suspend plans to file an IND for ZGN-1258 in order to evaluate ZGN-1258 following an unexpected finding in muscle tissue in rodent toxicology studies.

 We have conducted nonclinical studies with positive preliminary results in multiple liver disease indications with high unmet medical need and in toxicological screening. Further nonclinical studies are ongoing. 
 For information regarding amounts spent during each of the last three fiscal years on company-sponsored research and development activities, see Part II “Item 6—Selected Financial Data” of this Annual Report. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 ZGN-1061 is a small molecule drug that is chemically synthesized. The current process to produce ZGN-1061 drug product for Phase 2 clinical trials involves sterile filtration and lyophilization that is reconstituted prior to administration. The Phase 2 drug product was manufactured and released at our drug product contract manufacturing organization, or CMO. The manufacturing processes for both drug substance and drug product are under active development and optimization and are not yet validated for commercialization. We control our clinical trial supply chain by periodically meeting to assess clinical trial material needs and status of supply. The clinical supply forecast is managed internally by a cross functional working group and is used to aid in decision making for production planning.

ZGN-1258 is a small molecule drug that is chemically synthesized. The current process to produce ZGN-1258 for Phase 1 clinical trials involves synthesis of drug substance and production of sterile liquid drug product which can be stored frozen. The Phase 2 drug product will be developed as a sterile, lyophilized product for reconstitution prior to administration, if further evaluation warrants continued development.
 We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We rely on contract manufacturers to produce both drug substance and drug product required for our clinical trials. Any delays encountered with manufacturing activities, CMO scheduling or raw material supply could delay the manufacturing of finished drug product. No long-term supply agreements are in place with our contractors, and each batch is individually contracted under a work order, which is governed by a quality agreement. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of ZGN-1061, ZGN-1258 and ZGN-1345, if approved, or if we elect to commercialize these product candidates on our own. Our current scale of manufacturing is adequate to support all of our current needs for clinical trial supplies. For commercial quantities for larger populations, we will need to identify contract manufacturers or partners to produce ZGN-1061 on a larger scale. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Based on our early stage of development, we have not yet established commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any partnership or co-promotion arrangements with an established pharmaceutical or biotechnology company. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure to launch our product candidates, we may either do so on our own or by establishing alliances with one or more pharmaceutical or other biotechnology company collaborators, depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the related development costs and our available resources. 
Licenses 
 CKD License 
 In July 2009, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corp. of South Korea, or CKD, pursuant to which we exclusively licensed beloranib from CKD on a worldwide basis, with the exception of South Korea. In consideration of such exclusive license, we paid an initial license fee to CKD, paid a one-time fee following initiation of a proof of concept trial, agreed to make milestone payments of up to $30.0 million (of which $7.5 million has been paid, including $3.3 million that was paid in the form of our common stock (valued at $3.6 million) as a result of an amendment to our license agreement and entry into a subscription agreement with CKD) to CKD upon the achievement of certain specified events, and agreed to pay a portion of sublicensing income to CKD. Furthermore, if we receive marketing approval for beloranib, we will pay single-digit royalties to CKD based on annual net sales of beloranib on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later to occur of (i) the expiration of the last to expire patent in such country within the CKD patent rights containing a valid claim covering beloranib or its use for which regulatory approval has been obtained in such country, or (ii) ten years from the first commercial sale of beloranib in such country. Pursuant to this agreement, we committed to using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize beloranib. This agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until royalties are no longer due in such country, subject to earlier termination by either party upon mutual consent, or in the event of uncured breach or insolvency on the part of the other party, or by us for any reason up to 60 days’ prior notice. 
Children’s License 
 In January 2007, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Children’s Medical Center Corporation, or Children’s, pursuant to which we exclusively licensed certain patent rights from Children’s on a worldwide basis. The licensed patent rights relate to decreasing the growth of fat tissue, and thereby cover the use of ZGN-1061 and related molecules as anti-obesity agents. In consideration of such exclusive license, we paid an initial license fee upon execution of the license to Children’s and annual maintenance fees through the fifth anniversary of the date of the license. We also agreed to make milestone payments to Children’s of up to $2.7 million (of which $0.4 million has been paid) with respect to the first licensed product and up to $1.3 million with respect to each subsequent licensed product, if any, that is a new chemical entity upon the achievement of certain specified events and to pay a portion of sublicensing income to Children’s. If we receive marketing approval for ZGN-1061, we will pay single-digit royalties to Children’s based on net sales of ZGN-1061 until the later to occur of (i) the expiration of the last to expire patent in such country within the licensed patents containing a valid claim covering ZGN-1061 or (ii) 15 years from the date of the agreement. This agreement will remain in effect for the longer of (i) 15 years or (ii) the life of the last expiring licensed patent, subject to earlier termination (x) by Children’s in the event 
 12

of our insolvency or our failure to cure a breach within 60 days (30 days in the case of non-payment) of receiving written notice thereof, or (y) by us for any reason upon 120 days’ prior written notice. 
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the proprietary position of ZGN-1061 and our other development programs. 
 As of March 1, 2019, we own two issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications and related pending foreign counterpart patent applications, as well as one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT patent application, and three pending U.S. provisional patent applications that relate to ZGN-1061.
 As of March 1, 2019, we own one issued U.S. patent, two pending U.S. patent applications, and one pending provisional patent application and related worldwide patent application, that relate to ZGN-1258.
 As of March 1, 2019, we own two pending U.S. patent applications, and related worldwide patent applications, and two pending PCT patent applications that relate to ZGN-1345.
 As of March 1, 2019, we own twenty-one issued U.S. patents, and three pending U.S. patent applications with pending foreign counterpart applications and three pending U.S. provisional patent applications, all of which relate to our internal efforts to discover novel MetAP2 inhibitors.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest effective filing date. Our issued patents will expire on dates ranging from 2020 to 2036. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim by claim and country to country basis for each applicable product and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 Furthermore, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we intend to develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions, and enforce our intellectual property rights and more generally, could affect the value of intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with 
 13

similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 
 As a result of the America Invents Act of 2011, the United States transitioned to a first-inventor-to-file system in March 2013, under which, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. This will require us to minimize the time from invention to the filing of a patent application. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and unpatented know-how to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our consultants, scientific advisors and contractors and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.” 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. PTO, to determine priority of invention. 
 In addition, substantial scientific and commercial research has been conducted for many years in the areas in which we have focused our development efforts, which has resulted in third parties having a number of issued patents and pending patent applications. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published only after 18 months from the priority date. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. Therefore, patent applications relating to drugs similar to ZGN-1061, ZGN-1258, ZGN-1345 and any future drugs, discoveries or technologies we might develop may have already been filed by others without our knowledge. 
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceuticals industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products will increase. Many of these and other existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. These competitors may develop and introduce products and processes comparable or superior to ours. 
Existing Type 2 Diabetes Drugs 
 Biguanides, or metformin, is first line pharmacotherapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes primarily due to the extensive experience, low cost and favorable benefit risk associated with it. While metformin is likely to remain the initial choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, ZGN-1061 will compete with sulfonylureas, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, thiazoladinediones, insulin, and various combination products. Although these pharmacotherapies are all effective to some extent in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, they each have notable limitations, and have not been found to halt the progression of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, additional effective and durable options are needed. 
 There are a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with type 2 diabetes drugs that are pursuing products with unique mechanisms of action for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
 14

PWS Drugs
 There are no current pharmacological treatments for regulating hunger and hyperphagia-related behaviors of patients with PWS, and bariatric surgery is contraindicated in patients with PWS. Multiple products are currently under investigation for treatment of hyperphagia and/or obesity in individuals with PWS including assessment of diazoxide choline controlled-release for treatment of hyperphagia by Soleno Therapeutics, Inc., intranasal carbetocin for treatment of hyperphagia by Levo Therapeutics Inc., livoletide for the treatment of hyperphagia by Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. and liraglutide for weight management by Novo Nordisk. These four investigational products are either under Phase 3 assessment or are preparing for Phase 3 assessment. Several products are being explored in various stages of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of development. No products under investigation by other companies are MetAP2 inhibitors and the safety and efficacy of their product candidates have not yet been established.
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products such as ZGN-1061, ZGN-1258 and ZGN-1345. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by such regulatory authority. 
U.S. Drug Development 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and applicable regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary product recalls, withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | Completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15

The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the nonclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans in the United States. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the clinical trial to be suspended or terminated. 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of clinical trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites, in multiple countries (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA, although additional Phase 3 clinical trials may be required for certain indications. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials conducted under an IND must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting, written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from animal or in vitro testing or other studies that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected 
 16

serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a clinical trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the clinical trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and manufacturers, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 NDA and FDA Review Process 
 Following clinical trial completion, clinical trial data are analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the drug, and other relevant information. The NDA is a request for approval to market the drug and must contain proof of safety and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive nonclinical and clinical testing. The application includes both negative or ambiguous results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the United States. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule for fiscal year 2019, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is $2,588,478. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for human drugs of $309,915. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard new molecular-entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for a priority new molecular-entity NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter 
 17

authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request an opportunity for a hearing. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
 There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, benefits. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 18

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
 Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. 
 Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug, such as: 
  
• | distribution restricted to certain facilities or physicians with special training or experience; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | distribution conditioned on the performance of specified medical procedures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The limitations imposed would be commensurate with the specific safety concerns presented by the drug. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Additionally, a drug or biological product may be eligible for designation as a Breakthrough Therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoint. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the same benefits as Fast Track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Pediatric Clinical Trials 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. 
 The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
 Post-Marketing Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on 
 19

promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. The FDA also imposes limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. 
 Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA. 
 In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific facilities, which are inspected as part of the FDA’s review of the NDA, and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, voluntary recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. 
 The FDA also may require post-approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and post-marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 Other Regulatory Matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. In the United States, sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 20

The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, voluntary recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the voluntary recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, minus any time the applicant did not act with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of pediatric trials in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such clinical trials.

European Union Drug Development 
 In the EU our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of nonclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the clinical trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation will apply in 2019. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. 
 European Union Drug Review and Approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: 
 The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e. in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 European Union New Chemical Entity Exclusivity 
 In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, 
 22

during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 In the EU, the European Commission, upon the recommendation of the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. 
 In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 Reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. 
 Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidate or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidate could reduce physician usage of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our 
 23

products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 The ACA, enacted in March 2010, has a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA is intended to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expands and increases industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and makes changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to annually report this information to The Center for Medicare and Medicaid services, or CMS, which posts the information on its website. 
 Since its enactment, there have been challenges to numerous aspects of the ACA, including efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, and the ACA has been modified in a number of respects. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation to date, the 2017 Tax Reform Act includes a provision repealing the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devises. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse the insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through these marketplaces. Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA. We cannot predict how the ACA, its possible repeal or replacement, any further action to modify the ACA, or the political uncertainty surrounding the ACA will affect our business. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, started in April 2013. On January 2, 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The ATRA, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower. 
 24

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which is part of the ACA, that requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs and biologics to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

ZAFGEN, INC. 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 1. Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation 
 Zafgen, Inc., or the Company, was incorporated on November 22, 2005 under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its proprietary knowledge of the methionine aminopeptidase 2 (“MetAP2”) pathway to develop novel therapies for patients affected by a range of complex metabolic diseases. Zafgen has pioneered the study of MetAP2 inhibitors in both common and rare metabolic disorders, and its current disease areas of focus are type 2 diabetes, Prader-Willi syndrome (“PWS”) and liver diseases. The Company’s lead product candidate is ZGN-1061, a MetAP2 inhibitor in Phase 2 clinical development with unique properties that maximize impact on metabolic parameters relevant to the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other related metabolic disorders. In January 2018, the Company announced advancement of its highly optimized MetAP2 development candidate ZGN-1258, and in the first quarter of 2018, initiated investigational new drug application (“IND”) enabling nonclinical efforts for evaluation in the treatment of people affected by PWS. In March 2019, we announced our decision to suspend plans to file an IND for ZGN-1258 in order to evaluate ZGN-1258 following an unexpected finding in muscle tissue in rodent toxicology studies. During the fourth quarter of 2018 the Company announced that ZGN-1345, an orally dosed MetAP2 inhibitor specifically targeting the liver, has been formally advanced to development candidate stage. The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key personnel, compliance with government regulations and the need to obtain additional financing. Product candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive nonclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval, prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel infrastructure, and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. 
 The Company’s product candidates are all in the research and development stage. There can be no assurance that the Company’s research and development will be successfully completed, that adequate protection for the Company’s intellectual property will be obtained, that any product candidates developed will obtain necessary government regulatory approval or that any approved products will be commercially viable. Even if the Company’s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate significant revenue from product sales. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and substantial competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, the Company is dependent upon the services of its employees and consultants. 
 The Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $350.9 million. From its inception through December 31, 2018, the Company received net proceeds of $397.9 million from the sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, the proceeds from its initial public offering (“IPO”) in June 2014 and its follow-on offerings in January 2015 and July 2018. On July 2, 2018, the Company completed a public offering of its common stock, which resulted in the sale of 9,200,000 shares at a price of $7.50 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $64.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, as well as offering costs. As disclosed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a term loan with an aggregate principal balance of $20.0 million as of December 31, 2018. The loan agreement requires that the Company maintain certain minimum liquidity at all times, which as of December 31, 2018, was approximately $21.0 million. If the minimum liquidity covenant is not met, the Company may be required to repay the loans prior to scheduled maturity dates. Until such time, if ever, as the Company can generate substantial product revenue, the Company expects to finance its cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other sources of funding.
 Based on its current operating plans, the Company believes its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $118.1 million as of December 31, 2018 will be sufficient to fund its anticipated level of operations, capital expenditures and satisfy debt repayments for a period of at least 12 months from the issuance date of this Annual Report. The Company expects to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings, the Company may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that the Company would otherwise prefer to develop and market itself.
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries Zafgen Securities Corporation, Zafgen Australia Pty Limited, and Zafgen Animal Health, LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
 79

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). 
 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the accrual of research and development expenses and the valuation of stock-based awards. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates. 
Cash Equivalents 
 The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less at acquisition date to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents, which consist of money market funds, U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, and commercial paper, are stated at fair value. 
Concentration of Credit Risk and of Significant Suppliers 
 Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The Company has all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances at three accredited financial institutions in amounts that exceed federally insured limits. The Company does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. 
 The Company is dependent on third-party manufacturers to supply products for research and development activities in its programs. In particular, the Company relies and expects to continue to rely on a small number of manufacturers to supply it with its requirements for the active pharmaceutical ingredients and formulated drugs related to these programs. These programs could be adversely affected by a significant interruption in the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients and formulated drugs. 
 Marketable Securities
 Marketable securities consist of investments with original maturities greater than ninety days. The Company has classified its investments with maturities beyond one year as short term, based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale. Accordingly, these investments are recorded at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are included as a component of other income (expense), net, based on the specific identification method. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, the Company considers various factors, including whether the Company has the intent to sell the security, and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. Fair value is determined based on quoted market prices. 
Deferred Offering Costs 
 The Company capitalizes certain legal, accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated with in-process equity financings as other assets until such financings are consummated. After consummation of the equity financing, these costs are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a reduction of additional paid-in capital generated as a result of the offering or as a reduction to the carrying value of preferred stock issued. 
Property and Equipment 
 Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method over a three or five-year estimated useful life for equipment, furniture and fixtures and office equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the asset life or the term of the lease agreement. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance of assets are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related 
 80

accumulated depreciation of assets disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in loss from operations. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows. To date, the Company has not recorded any impairment losses on long-lived assets. 
 Research and Development Costs 
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Included in research and development expenses are wages, stock-based compensation and benefits of employees, third-party license fees and milestones and other operational costs related to the Company’s research and development activities, including facility-related expenses and external costs of outside vendors engaged to conduct nonclinical studies, manufacturing activities, and clinical trials. The Company records research and development expenses net of any research and development tax incentives the Company is entitled to receive from government authorities. 
Research Contract Costs and Accruals 
 The Company has entered into various research and development contracts with research institutions and other companies both inside and outside of the United States. These agreements are generally cancelable, and related payments are recorded as research and development expenses as incurred. The Company records accruals for estimated ongoing research costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, the Company analyzes progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates. The Company’s historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from the actual costs. 
Patent Costs 
 All patent-related costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications are recorded as general and administrative expenses as incurred, as recoverability of such expenditures is uncertain. 
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
 The Company measures all stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Compensation expense of those awards is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Typically, the Company issues awards with only service-based and market-based vesting conditions and records the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
 For stock-based awards granted to non-employee consultants, compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is re-measured using the then-current fair value of the Company’s common shares and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. 
 The Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient’s payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified.
 81

Income Taxes 
 The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or in the Company’s tax returns. Deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. 
 The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. 
 Segment Data 
 The Company manages its operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to significantly improving the health and well-being of patients affected by both rare and prevalent metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes, PWS, liver diseases and potentially other metabolically related disorders. No revenue has been generated since inception, and all tangible assets are held in the United States. 
Comprehensive Loss 
 Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s only element of other comprehensive loss was unrealized gain or (loss) on marketable securities. 
Net Loss Per Share 
 Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted common shares, as determined using the treasury stock method. For periods in which the Company has reported net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is antidilutive. 
 82

Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements. The new leasing standards generally require lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the consolidated balance sheet and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2019 and will not restate comparative periods. Presentation of leases within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and consolidated statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance. The Company will elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance and as such, the adoption of this ASU will not change the classification of any of the Company’s leases. The Company will elect to combine lease and non-lease components, elect not to record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet and recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company is still assessing its existing lease contracts and the impact of the new leasing standards on its consolidated results of operations, financial position and disclosures. The Company currently expects the impact of adoption of the new leasing standards will have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet in recognizing additional lease liabilities and right-of-use assets as of January 1, 2019 related to the Company’s operating leases. The Company does not expect that the new standard will have a material impact on its consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This guidance addresses the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This standard was effective for the Company in 2018. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting. This guidance addresses which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. This standard was effective for the Company in 2018. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU is intended to simplify aspects of share-based compensation issued to non-employees by making the guidance consistent accounting for employee share-based compensation. ASU 2018-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair value determined by Level 2 inputs utilize observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted market prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets.

6. Notes Payable 
 On December 29, 2017, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan provided for borrowings of $20.0 million. On December 29, 2017, the Company received proceeds of $20.0 million from the issuance of a promissory note. The promissory note issued under the Term Loan is collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s personal property, other than its intellectual property. 
 Upon entering into this Term Loan, the Company is obligated to make monthly, interest-only payments until March 29, 2019 and, thereafter, to pay 33 consecutive, equal monthly installments of principal and interest from April 1, 2019 through December 1, 2021. The outstanding Term Loan bears a variable annual interest rate of 1.25% above the prime rate, which at December 31, 2018 was 5.5%. In addition, a final payment equal to 8.0% of the Term Loan is due upon the earlier of the maturity date, acceleration of the Term Loan or prepayment of all or part of the Term Loan. The Company accrues the final payment amount of $1.6 million, to outstanding debt by charges to interest expense using the effective-interest method from the date of issuance through the maturity date. The effective annual interest rate of the outstanding debt under the Term Loan is approximately 9.9% as of December 31, 2018. 
 Additionally, the Company, as the borrower, is required to maintain a minimum cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at Silicon Valley Bank of no less than 105% of the total outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan, which as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $21.0 million.
 Further, as of 45 days after the Term Loan was entered in, the Company must maintain a balance of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at Silicon Valley Bank in an amount not less than the greater of (i) $55.0 million and (ii) sixty-five percent (65%) of all the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. If the Company does not meet this requirement it will not be considered an event of default provided it immediately secures 87.5% of the principal balance in a restricted cash account. 
 86

There are negative covenants restricting the Company’s activities, including limitations on dispositions, mergers or acquisitions; encumbering or granting a security interest in its intellectual property; incurring indebtedness or liens; paying dividends; making certain investments; permit the aggregate value of cash maintained by its Australian subsidiary not to exceed $4.0 million and certain other business transactions. 
 The Term Loan also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of any of which provides the lenders the right to exercise remedies against the Company and the collateral securing the loans under the Term Loan, including cash in the amount of the outstanding balance. These events of default include, among other things, failure to pay any amounts due under the Term Loan, insolvency, the occurrence of a material adverse event, the occurrence of any default under certain other indebtedness and a final judgment against the Company in an amount greater than $0.3 million.
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company had fully repaid all outstanding amounts due under a loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Midcap Financial (the “2014 Credit Facility”) entered into in March 2014.

The Company has no obligation to sell any shares under the Sales Agreement, and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the Sales Agreement. The shares will be issued pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed on August 9, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

 8. Stock-Based Awards 
 Stock Option Plan 
 The Company’s 2014 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, unrestricted stock awards, performance-share awards, cash-based awards and dividend equivalent rights to employees, members of the board of directors and consultants of the Company. The number of shares initially reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan was 2,168,221 shares of common stock. The number of shares reserved for issuance may be increased by the number of shares under the previously authorized 2006 Stock Option Plan that are not needed to fulfill the Company’s obligations for awards issued under the 2006 Stock Option Plan as a result of forfeiture, expiration, cancellation, termination or net issuances of awards thereunder. The number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2014 Plan is also subject to increase on the first day of each fiscal year by the lesser of (i) 4% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock as of that date, or (ii) an amount determined by the board of directors. As of December 31, 2018, 2,499,951 shares are available for grant under the 2014 Plan, including 1,099,578 shares automatically added to the 2014 Stock Option Plan on January 1, 2018. 
Stock Option Grants
 Option Grants with time-based vesting conditions
 During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company granted 1,823,386, 1,214,874 and 1,527,559 stock options, respectively, under the 2014 Plan. The vesting of these awards is time-based and the restrictions typically lapse over periods of three to four years. Stock options were granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company bases fair value of common stock on the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 the Company granted 225,000 and 550,000 options, respectively, with time-based vesting as inducement grants outside of the 2014 Plan in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). These stock options have a ten-year term and an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The options vest as to 25% of the shares on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remainder in equal monthly installments thereafter over a 3-year period.
 The fair value of each service-based stock option grant to employees and directors is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company estimates its expected volatility using a weighted average of the historical volatility of publicly-traded peer companies and its own common stock since its IPO in June 2014, and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price for the duration of the expected term. The expected term of the Company’s stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The assumptions that the Company used to determine the fair value of the stock options granted to employees and directors are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis: 
 
 
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
-------------------------+------+------+---+------+------+-----
Risk-free interest rate | | 2.77 | % | | 2.10 | % | 1.40 | %
Expected term (in years) | | 6.17 | | | 6.17 | | 6.18 | 
Expected volatility | | 100 | % | | 93 | % | 87 | %
Expected dividend yield | | 0 | % | | 0 | % | 0 | %

 
88

The following table summarizes the Company’s stock option activity described above, since December 31, 2017: 
 
 
 | Shares | | | Weighted | | | Average | | 
--------------------------------------------+----------+-----------+---+----------+---+-------+-------------+------------+---------------
 | Issuable | | | Average | | | Remaining | Aggregate

Outstanding as of December 31, 2018 | | 5,024,371 | | | $ | 8.85 | | 7.6 | $ | 3,143
Options exercisable as of December 31, 2018 | | 2,421,674 | | | $ | 11.22 | | 6.1 | $ | 2,240

 
The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated based on the positive differences between the market value of the Company’s common stock and the exercise prices of the options. The aggregate intrinsic value of service-based stock options exercised was $1.6 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 The Company received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $2.2 million, $0.1 million, and less than $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 The weighted average grant-date fair value of service-based stock options granted to employees and directors during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $6.08, $2.91 and $4.86, per share, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were outstanding unvested service-based stock options held by nonemployees for the purchase of 45,209 and 77,567 shares of common stock, respectively.
 Option Grants with market-based vesting conditions
 In October 2017, the Company granted 687,500 common stock options that vest on the third anniversary of the grant date upon achievement by the Company of minimum common stock prices for 20 consecutive days during the Earning Period, the (“Price Target Options”). The Earning Period is defined as the period between the first anniversary of the grant date and the third anniversary of the grant date. Of the 687,500 Price Target Options granted in 2017, 137,500 were granted under the 2014 Stock Plan and 550,000 were granted to the newly-hired Chief Executive Officer as an inducement grant outside of the 2014 Plan in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). These stock options have a ten-year term and an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. In August 2018, the 137,500 shares granted under the 2014 Stock Plan were forfeited.
 The number of Price Target Options that will vest upon achievement of the target will vary based on the level of achievement from a maximum of 200% of the target shares to a threshold of 50% of the target shares, with no vesting, absent certain circumstances, if the threshold requirement is not achieved or the employee is no longer with the Company at the end of the three-year period. The Price Target Options are valued using Monte Carlo simulation models. The number of options expected to vest, based on achievement of the specified market condition, is factored into the grant date Monte Carlo valuations for the Price Target Options. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the attribution period. 
 The assumptions that the Company used to determine the fair value of the Price Target Options granted to employees were as follows, presented on a weighted average basis: 
 
 
 | 2017 | 
-------------------------+------+-----
Risk-free interest rate | | 2.24 | %
Expected term (in years) | | 6.30 | 
Expected volatility | | 95 | %
Expected dividend yield | | 0 | %

 
89

The Price Target Options had a grant date total fair value of $3.1 million and a weighted average fair value of $4.56 per share. As of December 31, 2018, the 550,000 Price Target Options had an aggregate intrinsic value of $0.9 million and a remaining contractual term of 8.77 years.
 Restricted Stock Units 
 The Company has granted restricted stock units with time-based vesting conditions. The Company values restricted stock units on the grant-date using the market price of the Company’s common stock. The aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $0.2 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million respectively, calculated as the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date it vests. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company granted 17,856, 22,128 and 13,273 restricted stock units, respectively, all of which vested during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $5.18, $4.18 and $7.91, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no unvested restricted stock units outstanding. 
2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 The Company has a 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) under which a total of 265,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. During both 2018 and 2017 there were two offering periods, January 1 through June 30 and July 1 through December 31. The per share purchase price for offerings is equal to the lesser of 85% of the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the first day or last day of the offering period. The Company issued 46,181 and 43,781 shares during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

In October 2015, the Company entered into an operating lease for office space in San Diego, California, effective as of October 1, 2015, with a term expiring on September 30, 2019, and an option to extend this lease for five additional years. 
 Future minimum lease payments for its operating leases as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:

Intellectual Property Licenses 
 The Company has acquired exclusive rights to develop patented compounds and related know-how for beloranib under two licensing agreements with two third parties in the course of its research and development activities. The licensing rights obligate the Company to make payments to the licensors for license fees, milestones, license maintenance fees and royalties. The Company is also responsible for patent prosecution costs.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company is obligated to make additional milestone payments of up to $12.3 million upon reaching certain pre-commercialization milestones, such as clinical trials and government approvals (including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or “FDA”, approval of a New Drug application, or “NDA”), and up to $12.5 million upon reaching certain product commercialization milestones related to the development of beloranib. Under one of the license agreements, the Company is also obligated to pay up to $1.3 million with respect to each subsequent licensed product, if any, that is a new chemical entity. In addition, the Company will owe single-digit royalties on sales of commercial products developed using these licensed technologies, if any. 
 There were no milestones achieved during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. The Company is also obligated to pay to the licensors a percentage of fees received if and when the Company sublicenses the technology. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not yet developed a commercial product using the licensed technologies and it has not entered into any sublicense agreements for the technologies. 
 Indemnification Agreements 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of management team and the board of directors of the Company that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any claims under indemnification arrangements will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and it has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018. 
Legal Proceedings 
 The Company accrues a liability for legal contingencies when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. The Company reviews these accruals and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and the views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations or legal proceedings change, changes in the Company’s accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. In addition, in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance, for any matters in which the likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible, the Company will provide disclosure of the possible loss or range of loss. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made, however, the Company will provide disclosure to that effect. The Company expenses legal costs as they are incurred. 
 The Company may periodically become subject to other legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with ongoing business activities, including claims or disputes related to patents that have been issued or that are pending in the field of research on which the Company is focused. Other than the above action, the Company is not aware of any other material claims as of December 31, 2018.

11. Income Taxes 
 During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded no income tax benefits for the net operating losses incurred in each year due to its uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. 
 The domestic and foreign components of loss before income taxes are as follows:

Changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 related primarily to changes in net operating loss carryforwards, capitalized research and development expenses and tax credit carryforwards and were as follows: 
 
 
 | Year Ended December 31, |

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards that expire for federal and state income tax purposes of $55.7 million and $48.0 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2030, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards that were generated after December 31, 2017 of $9.5 million that do not expire. As of December 31, 2018, the Company also had available tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $16.6 million and $3.4 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2022, respectively. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. 
 In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. The Company has not conducted a study to assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since inception due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such a study. If the Company has experienced a change of control, as defined by Section 382, at any time since inception, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, which is determined by first multiplying the value of the Company’s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed and any limitation is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position. 
 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s gross deferred tax asset balance of $101.7 million and $87.7 million, respectively, was comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards, capitalized research and development expenses and tax credit carryforwards. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, gross deferred tax assets increased (decreased) due to additional net operating loss carryforwards, research and development tax credits generated and additional research and development expenses capitalized for tax purposes and the effects of tax reform. 
 The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon its ability to realize the deferred tax assets. Management has considered the Company’s history of cumulative net losses incurred since inception and its lack of commercialization of any products or generation of any revenue from product sales since inception and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Management reevaluates the positive and negative evidence at each reporting period. 
 The Company has not recorded any amounts for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
 The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and state jurisdictions, where applicable. There are currently no pending income tax examinations. The Company’s tax years are still open under statute from 2014 to the present. Earlier years may be examined to the extent that tax credit or net operating loss carryforwards are used in future periods. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income taxes as part of its income tax provision. 
 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was signed into U.S. law. The TCJA includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% down to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each 
 94

case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely).
 As a result of the TCJA, the Company was required to revalue deferred tax assets and liabilities at 21%. This revaluation in 2017 resulted in a provision of $33.8 million to income tax expense in continuing operations and a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance. There was no impact to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a result of the reduction in rates. The other provisions of the TCJA did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the SEC, the income tax effect of the TCJA represents provisional amounts for which the Company’s accounting is incomplete but for which reasonable estimates were determined and recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. The guidance provides for a measurement period, up to one year from the enactment date, in which provisional amounts may be adjusted when additional information is obtained, prepared and analyzed. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no changes made to the provisional amounts recognized in 2017 in connection with the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. The accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act is complete as of December 31, 2018.
 12. Retirement Plan 
 Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted a 401(k) plan for its employees. Under the terms of the plan, the Company contributes 3% of an employee’s annual base salary, up to a maximum of the annual Internal Revenue Service compensation limits, for all employees. The Company terminated its Savings Incentive Match Plan, or SIMPLE IRA as of December 31, 2017.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized $0.3 million of expense related to its contributions to the 401(k) plan.
 During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of expense related to its contributions to the SIMPLE IRA.
 13. Australia Research and Development Tax Incentive 
 The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Zafgen Australia Pty Limited, which conducts core research and development activities on behalf of the Company, is eligible to receive a 43.5% refundable tax incentive for qualified research and development activities. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, $1.6 million, $0.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively, were recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. These amounts represented 43.5% for 2018 and 2017 and 45% for 2016, of the Company’s qualified research and development spending in Australia. The refund is denominated in Australian dollars and, therefore, the related receivable is re-measured into U.S. dollars as of each reporting date. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded in its consolidated statements of operations unrealized foreign currency exchange (losses) gains of $(0.2) million, $0.1 million, and less than $(0.1) million, respectively, related to this tax incentive receivable. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s tax incentive receivable from the Australian government was $1.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. 
14. Restructuring 
 On July 19, 2016, the Company announced that following a comprehensive review of its assets and clinical programs, as well as feedback from regulatory authorities, the Company refocused its resources on development of a differentiated second-generation MetAP2 inhibitor, ZGN-1061. As part of the strategic restructuring, the Company reorganized its operations to align with its new priorities focused on ZGN-1061 development. The Company’s workforce was reduced by approximately 31% as of December 2016.
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $1.4 million of restructuring-related costs in operating expenses, including employee severance, benefits and related costs, as well as a stock option modification. The stock option modification was a one-time, non-cash expense of $0.2 million and is included in the stock-based compensation expense line items of both the consolidated statements of cash flows and the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2016. The Company does not expect to incur any additional significant costs associated with this restructuring.
