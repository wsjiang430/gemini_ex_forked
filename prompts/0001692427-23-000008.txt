Item 1. Business 
Overview

NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. (“NCS,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well construction, well completions and field development strategies. We provide our products and services primarily to E&P companies for use in onshore and offshore wells, predominantly wells that have been drilled with horizontal laterals in both unconventional and conventional oil and natural gas formations. Our products and services are utilized in oil and natural gas basins throughout North America and in selected international markets, including Argentina, China, the Middle East and the North Sea. Our extensive research and development efforts are influenced and driven by the needs of our customers, allowing us to introduce innovative and commercial solutions that improve customer efficiency and profitability. We provided our products and services to over 245 customers in 2022, including leading large independent oil and natural gas companies and major oil companies.

Our primary offering is our fracturing systems products and services, which enable efficient pinpoint stimulation: the process of individually stimulating each entry point into a formation targeted by an oil or natural gas well. We began providing pinpoint stimulation products and services in 2006 and our fracturing systems products and services are typically utilized in cemented wellbores and enable our customers to precisely place stimulation treatments in a more controlled and repeatable manner as compared with traditional completion techniques. Fracturing systems products and services include our casing-installed sliding sleeves and downhole frac isolation assembly. Customers typically purchase our casing-installed sliding sleeves, a consumable product that is cemented at intervals into the casing of the wellbore and can also utilize our services, in which our personnel supervise the use of our downhole frac isolation assembly during completion operations. Our fracturing systems products and services are utilized in conjunction with third-party providers of pressure pumping, coiled tubing and other services.

We offer enhanced recovery systems, which enable our customers to inject water, other fluids, or gases in a controlled manner with the objective of increasing the amount of hydrocarbons produced from their assets.

We own a 50% controlling interest in Repeat Precision, LLC (“Repeat Precision”), which we consolidate. Repeat Precision sells composite frac plugs, perforating guns and related products directly to customers and provides high-quality machining services for NCS products.

We provide tracer diagnostics services for well completion and reservoir characterization that utilize downhole chemical and radioactive tracers. Our customers utilize these services to better characterize their assets and to optimize completion designs. Chemical and radioactive tracer studies may provide a cost-effective and reliable means to determine the production profile along a lateral, assess fluid and proppant communication between wells during completions and determine the efficiency of completion designs at the stage and cluster level.

We sell products for well construction, including our casing buoyancy systems, liner hanger systems and toe initiation sleeves. Our customers utilize these products to safely and efficiently install casing and production liners, facilitate cementing operations and initiate a flow path into the formation at the commencement of stimulation operations.

Our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled $155.6 million and $118.5 million, respectively. Our net loss attributable to NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled $(1.1) million and $(4.7) million, respectively. Our total assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled $138.6 million and $142.3 million, respectively. For additional financial information by geographic area, see “Note 17. Segment and Geographic Information” of our consolidated financial statements. 

Business Strategy 

Our business strategy is to increase the adoption of our products and services in all geographies, to continue to be an innovator of technology and to create value for our stockholders. We intend to achieve these objectives by (i) pursuing disciplined organic growth and increasing our market share through adoption of our products and services in the United States, Canada and in select international markets, (ii) developing and introducing innovative technologies that are aligned with customer needs, (iii) maintaining financial strength and flexibility and (iv) selectively pursuing complementary mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures.

We have diversified our revenue base through this strategy, including the investment in Repeat Precision and the acquisition of Spectrum Tracer Services, LLC in 2017. In 2022, approximately 65% of our revenue was derived from fracturing systems products and services and enhanced oil recovery systems, approximately 15% was derived from Repeat Precision and approximately 10% was derived from each of our well construction products and tracer diagnostics services. This represents a more balanced portfolio, serving 

 

a larger addressable market than in 2016, when over 90% of our revenue was derived from fracturing systems products and services, with the remainder from well construction products.

Products and Services 

We provide highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well construction, well completions and field development strategies. Our key products and services include:

Fracturing Systems. Our fracturing systems products and services encompass our technology developed to enable efficient pinpoint stimulation, selective stage isolation and re-stimulation strategies. Pinpoint stimulation is the process of individually stimulating each entry point into an oil or natural gas formation. We believe that pinpoint stimulation provides benefits compared to traditional completion techniques. Our pinpoint stimulation solutions and refined field processes are designed to enable efficient, controlled, verifiable, and repeatable completions. Some of our products can also be utilized later in a well’s life to allow for selective stage isolation or to enhance injection efficiencies if the well is converted from a production well to an injection well.
Our fracturing systems products and services are comprised of our casing-installed sliding sleeves and our downhole frac isolation assemblies, which are typically deployed using coiled tubing and can also be deployed on threaded pipe. Our services include operating the downhole frac isolation assemblies and advising customers on optimizing completion designs and field efficiencies.
oCasing-installed sliding sleeves. Our casing-installed sliding sleeves are a consumable product, sold to our customers and integral to a well’s casing. These sliding sleeves can be used in both cemented and open-hole wellbores in vertical, deviated or horizontal wells. There is no practical limitation on the number of sleeves that can be installed in a well, and all sleeves have an inner diameter that is similar to the casing in the wellbore. Our primary model of sliding sleeves can be opened and closed multiple times throughout the life of a well. These closable sleeves provide our customers the benefit of additional completion or production options and the ability to better optimize a well’s overall performance. 
During completion operations, the downhole frac isolation assembly is located in the sleeve and the inner barrel of the sleeve is shifted down, exposing the frac ports to the formation, allowing the stimulation of that stage to begin. Regarding our closable sleeves, the inner barrel can be shifted up to re-isolate the frac ports. These sleeves can often be re-opened or re-closed at any time, allowing our customers to selectively access or isolate segments of the wellbore. Several generations of sliding sleeves have been developed over the years, each providing improvements in functionality and reliability.
Innovus. The Innovus line of sliding sleeves is the current generation of our fracturing sleeves designed primarily for the onshore market. This line of sleeves comes in standard duty and heavy duty (high pressure and high rate) models.
Ratek. The Ratek line of sliding sleeves has been commercialized for more stringent environments, including high torque, high burst and collapse, and high compression environments, features that are required for many offshore applications. We offer Ratek sleeves with ISO V0 and V3 ratings.
oDownhole frac isolation assembly. Our proprietary downhole frac isolation assembly is comprised of several components, including a resettable bridge plug for stage isolation, a sleeve locator to efficiently locate our sliding sleeves in the wellbore, an optional abrasive perforating sub that can create additional perforations in the casing, and gauge packages that can measure and record downhole data. The assembly tool, which is attached to a third-party threaded pipe, is primarily used to locate and shift our sliding sleeves open or closed. The systems provide real time-downhole pressure measurements as well as recorded pressure temperature and force measurements. We typically utilize the assemblies in our service to our customers and do not sell them. Our personnel operate the assemblies in coordination with other on-site service providers.
oSand jet perforating. Our sand jet perforating technology was part of the first NCS frac isolation assembly used for pinpoint stimulation. To cut access points into the formation, sand-laden fluid is pumped down the coiled tubing and through tungsten-carbide nozzles in the frac isolation assembly. The high-velocity slurry cuts a tunnel through the casing and cement and into the formation. The tunnels serve as access points for stimulation. Stimulation treatments are pumped down the annulus between the coiled tubing and the casing. This technology provides a practical option for pinpoint stimulation in wells that are already cased, such as for drilled, but uncompleted (“DUC”) wells.
Enhanced Recovery. Our Enhanced Recovery product line evolved as an extension of our experience with fracturing systems, featuring a series of injection control devices to deliver fluid at a predetermined rate to selected stages along the wellbore. This product line includes valve systems to extend the life of a well by conversion from primary hydrocarbon production operations to enhanced recovery operations such as waterflood or gas injection. 





oInnovus Convertible. This sliding sleeve is a dual barrel version of our Innovus sleeve. Following the initial fracturing and production phase, a second inner barrel can be shifted to convert the frac ports to flow paths utilized to control injection. Water or gas can then be selectively injected into the reservoir at a predetermined rate suitable for enhanced recovery operations, extending the useful life of the original completion.
oTerrus System. This system includes injection control devices with customizable flow rates that can be assembled into various configurations and deployed between isolation devices to create a customized water or gas injection string for installation in existing wells. 
Repeat Precision. Repeat Precision sells its high-performance Purple Seal line of composite frac plugs and bridge plugs, RP single-use disposable setting tools, Purple Seal Express systems that combine a Purple Seal Frac Plug with a single-use disposable setting tool, and related products directly to E&P companies. Repeat Precision began selling PurpleFire perforating guns, devices utilized to perforate a well’s casing, in late 2021. The entry into perforating guns expands Repeat Precision’s addressable market and compliments its existing completion tool technologies. Repeat Precision sells perforating guns to other oilfield services companies that act as distributors and convey the tools downhole for E&P companies. Repeat Precision also provides high-quality machining services for certain NCS products.
Tracer Diagnostics. We provide chemical and radioactive tracer diagnostics services used by our customers to assess wellbore clearance, completion performance, well production and well-to-well communication. Our technology includes fracture fluid identifier tracers (“FFIs”), particulate water-soluble tracers (“WSTs”), particulate oil-soluble tracers (“OSTs”) and reservoir natural gas tracers (“RGTs”), which enable efficient, cost-effective downhole diagnostics, providing E&P companies with critical data to better optimize field and reservoir development and production/injection performance.
Well Construction. Our well construction products are designed to allow our customers to safely and efficiently install casing and production liners, facilitate cementing operations and initiate a flow path into the formation at the commencement of stimulation operations.
oAirLock casing buoyancy system. Our AirLock casing buoyancy system facilitates landing casing strings in horizontal wells to the desired depth, while minimizing running time and surface hook-load. The AirLock assembly is installed in the casing string, allowing the vertical casing section to be filled with fluid, while the lateral section remains more air-filled. The air-filled segment significantly reduces sliding friction, while the weight of the vertical section provides the force to push the casing to depth. After the casing is landed, surface pressure is increased to release and shatter the glass or ceramic seal at a predetermined pressure, leaving an unrestricted casing bore.
oVecturon and Vectraset liner hanger systems. Our proprietary and robust liner hanger systems are specifically designed to hang and seal the production liner in complex horizontal wells. Our liner hanger systems are fully compatible with our fracturing systems products. The liner hanger is used to distribute the weight of the liner to the supporting casing. The system can be set in the absence of a wiper plug bump.
oToe initiation sleeves. Our toe initiation sleeves are designed to provide initial formation access for multistage completions. After shifting open the toe initiation sleeve, a customer can perform a casing integrity test, a pre-frac injection fall-off test, flush the wellbore to facilitate the pumping of completion tools to the toe of the well or execute the first fracturing stage for the well.

Business History

We were incorporated in Delaware on November 28, 2012, under the name “Pioneer Super Holdings, Inc.” On December 13, 2016, we changed our name to “NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc.” On May 3, 2017, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock.
Intellectual Property and Patent Protection 

We have dedicated resources to the development and acquisition of new technology and products designed to optimize well construction, well completions and field development strategies, primarily for use in onshore and offshore wells drilled with horizontal laterals in both unconventional and conventional oil and natural gas formations. Our sales and earnings are influenced by our ability to successfully introduce new or improved products to the North American and international markets. Our equipment and services involve proprietary technologies, some of which are protected by patents.

We hold 59 U.S. utility patents and 50 related international utility patents, which relate to various products and services from each of our product lines, such as our casing buoyancy systems, OSTs, casing installed sliding sleeves, frac isolation assemblies, frac plug setting tools and other equipment and methods utilized in the provision of our services. Our U.S. utility patents expire between 2030 and 2040. Our international utility patents expire between 2028 and 2037.

 



We also have a number of U.S. and international patent applications pending. Some of these patent applications cover equipment and methods which are currently in development. The applications are in various stages of the patent prosecution process and patents may not be issued on such applications in any jurisdiction for some time, if they are issued at all.

We believe that our patents have historically been important in enabling us to compete in the market to supply our customers with our products and services. We intend to enforce, and have in the past vigorously enforced, our intellectual property rights. We are currently and may from time to time in the future be involved in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our patent rights. In addition to patent rights, we use a significant amount of trade secrets, or “know-how,” and other proprietary information and technology as well as intellectual property licensed from third parties.

Customers 

Our customer base primarily consists of oil and natural gas producers in North America and certain international markets as well as oilfield service companies. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had over 245 and 225 customers, respectively. Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 24% and 30% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No single customer represented more than 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Although we believe we have a broad customer base and wide geographic coverage of operations, the loss of one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For additional information relating to risks regarding the loss of any of our significant customers, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Sales and Marketing 

Our sales and marketing activities are performed through a technically-trained sales force. We recognize the importance of a technical marketing program in demonstrating the advantages of new technologies that offer benefits relative to established industry methodologies. Our technical sales force advises customers on the benefits of pinpoint stimulation, Innovus and Ratek sliding sleeves, enhanced recovery systems, well construction products and tracer diagnostics services.

In the United States and Canada, sales of our fracturing systems products and services, enhanced recovery systems, liner hangers, toe initiation sleeves and tracer diagnostics services are made directly to E&P companies. Our customers also hire coiled tubing companies and pressure pumping services companies that work alongside us during the completion of a well. We provide our casing buoyancy systems directly to E&P companies as well as to oilfield services companies that act as distributors for this product. Although we do not typically maintain supply or service contracts with our customers, a significant portion of our sales represents recurring business. Repeat Precision, which maintains a sales force separate from NCS in the United States, sells its products directly to E&P companies as well as to oilfield services companies that act as distributors. 

International sales are made through local NCS entities or to our local operating partners on a free on board or free carrier basis with a point of sale in the United States. Some of the locations in which we have operating partners or sales representatives include China and the Middle East. Our operating partners and representatives do not have authority to contractually bind our company, but market our products in their respective territories as part of their product or services offering.

We provide extensive support services and have developed proprietary methodologies for assessing and reporting the information that is collected on our downhole gauges and through tracer diagnostics evaluations. 

In addition to the technical marketing effort, we occasionally engage in field trials to demonstrate the economic benefits of our products and services. 

Seasonality

A substantial portion of our business is subject to quarterly variability. In Canada, we typically experience higher activity levels in the first quarter of each year, as our customers take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In the past, our revenue in Canada has declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions that result in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing well sites and road bans that curtail drilling and completion activity. Access to well sites typically improves throughout the third and fourth quarters in Canada, leading to activity levels that are higher than in the second quarter, but usually lower than activity in the first quarter. As we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2022, our business can be impacted by a reduction in customer activity during the winter holidays in late December and early January. In recent years, many customers in the United States and Canada exhausted their capital budgets prior to the end of the year, leading to reductions in drilling and completion activity during the fourth quarter.
Suppliers and Raw Materials

We acquire components, raw materials and parts from suppliers, including machine shops. The prices we pay for our raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, steel and other commodity prices, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency exchange rates. Most of the components, raw materials and parts that we use in our operations, such as steel in various forms, electronic components, chemicals and elastomers are available from many sources. 

We generally try to purchase our components, raw materials and parts from multiple suppliers, so we are not dependent on any one supplier. We will generally utilize multiple machine shops for the manufacturing of our component parts so that we are not dependent on any one machine shop. In recent years, we have reduced our internal manufacturing capacity in an effort to reduce fixed costs and have relied more heavily on certain machine shops. Our suppliers are also active in multiple regions which allows us to react to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and tariffs and duties. For example, we have made changes to the suppliers of certain raw materials based on tariff rates. In addition, sourcing certain product categories from Repeat Precision allows us to reduce our costs.

The continuing impacts of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic are contributing to occasional supply chain disruptions, particularly in China, and to cost inflation, including labor cost inflation. To address this, we have qualified additional vendors or materials in instances where availability has been impacted or for which delivery times have increased. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information.

Operating Risks and Insurance

We currently carry a variety of insurance for our operations. Although we believe we currently maintain insurance coverage adequate for the risks involved, there is a risk our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or that our insurance may not cover all losses.
Competition

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, we must provide services and products that meet the specific needs of E&P companies at competitive prices. We compete in all areas of our operations with a number of companies, some of which have financial and other resources greater than or comparable to ours.

We believe that we compete not only against other providers of pinpoint stimulation equipment and services, but also with companies that support the other primary means of hydraulically fracturing a horizontal well, including plug and perf and ball drop completions. We also compete with other suppliers of well construction products, enhanced recovery systems, tracer diagnostics services, composite frac plugs and perforating guns.

Our major competitors for our completion products and services include Baker Hughes Company (“Baker Hughes”), Core Laboratories N.V., DMC Global Inc., Forum Energy Technologies, Inc., Halliburton Company, Innovex Downhole Solutions, Nine Energy Service, Inc., NOV Inc., Oil States International, Inc., Packers Plus Energy Services Inc., SLB, Schoeller-Bleckmann Oilfield Equipment AG and Weatherford International public limited company as well as a number of smaller or regional competitors.

We believe that the most significant factors influencing a customer’s decision to utilize our equipment and services are technology, service quality, safety track record and price. While we must be competitive in our pricing, we believe our customers select our products and services based on the technical attributes of our products and equipment, the level of technical and operational service we provide before, during and after the job, and the know-how derived from our extensive operational track record.

Government Regulations 

We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of worker health, safety and the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, capital expenditures to prevent, limit or address emissions and discharges, and stringent practices to handle, recycle and dispose of certain wastes and materials. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective obligations, and the issuance of injunctive relief.

We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Further, we do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, laws and regulations protecting the environment, health and safety generally have become more stringent in recent years and are expected to continue to do so. It is possible that we could incur substantial costs for compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the future. Moreover, it is possible that other 

 

developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify.

While we do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations, we and/or our customers are subject to a wide range of such laws and regulations, which could materially and adversely affect their businesses and indirectly, through reduced demand for our products and services, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including with respect to the following:
Air Emissions. The Federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other emission control requirements. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting non-compliant operations.
Water Discharges. The Federal Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into state waters or waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
Climate Change. Governmental and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions is giving rise to an increased likelihood of regulatory actions to address climate change in the United States and abroad. As a result, our customers are or may become subject to statutes or regulations aiming to reduce emissions of GHGs. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has proposed regulations restricting emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA, including establishing New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”), a set of uniform technology-based standards for new and modified sources of air pollution, that govern emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds from new and modified oil and natural gas development and production operations. EPA is also expected to issue NSPS for new gas-fired power plants and existing coal and gas power plants in March 2023. In addition, in November 2021, EPA issued a proposed rule and a corresponding supplemental proposal in November 2022, that would sharply reduce the emission of methane and other air pollutants from both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry. The proposal would expand current emissions reduction requirements for new, modified and reconstructed oil and natural gas sources, and would require states to reduce methane emissions from hundreds of thousands of existing sources nationwide for the first time. Most recently, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 became law in August 2022, and aims to reduce GHGs, including carbon dioxide, by 40 percent by 2030. The Inflation Reduction Act provides billions of dollars in grants and loans designed to facilitate financing and deployment of renewable energy projects in the United States. While the scope and future implementation of any final rules regarding such proposed NSPS, emissions requirements and financial incentives, remain uncertain, these rules could have an adverse effect on our customers and result in an indirect material adverse effect on our business.
Various U.S. states or groups of states have adopted or considered adopting legislation, regulations or other governmental actions focused on reducing GHG emissions, including cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking initiatives and renewable portfolio standards. At the international level, the United States is a party to the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement, a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how any legal requirements imposed following the implementation of the Paris Agreement or otherwise that may be adopted or issued to address GHG emissions would impact our business or that of our customers, any such future laws, regulations or legal requirements imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, oil and natural gas exploration activities could require our customers to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with their operations. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce.

 



Non-Hazardous and Hazardous Wastes. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws control the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of wastes that our customers generate. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. It is possible, however, that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our customers’ costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes and a corresponding decrease in their drilling operations, which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Contamination. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and comparable state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. 
Occupational Health and Safety. We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, establishing requirements to protect the health and safety of workers. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
Radioactive Materials. Part of our business involves the use of radioactive tracers, typically consisting of three standard isotopes (Iridium 192, Scandium 46 and Antimony 124), to help determine the existence of fractures within a well formation. The use of these materials requires us to obtain and comply with radioactive materials licenses issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) or its counterparts in the states where we perform these services if they are among the states to which the NRC has delegated its regulatory authority pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act (so-called “Agreement States”). Under the terms of these licenses, we are required to train designated personnel, maintain records, submit periodic reports, ensure the safety and reliability of related equipment and storage facilities, conduct radiation safety monitoring, and ensure the proper disposal of materials and equipment at the end of their useful lives. In the event we fail to adequately comply with these requirements, we could be subject to enforcement action, which could include fines, injunctive relief, or the revocation of our licenses.

In addition, the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities, including with respect to permitting for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and operations reporting. Legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is frequently under review for amendment or expansion, which can increase the regulatory burden. Failure to comply with laws and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties. In addition, the effect of these regulations may be to limit or increase the cost of oil and natural gas E&P companies, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and indirectly materially and adversely affect our business. Although changes to the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry could affect the demand for our services, we would not expect to be affected any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry with similar operations.

We supply equipment and services to customers in the oil and natural gas industry conducting hydraulic fracturing operations. Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our customers purchase our products and services for use in their hydraulic fracturing activities. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. In fact, California is taking steps to ban fracking on state-permitted lands in 2024. Aside from state laws, local land use restrictions may restrict drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Municipalities may adopt local ordinances attempting to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether or, at a minimum, allow such fracturing processes within their jurisdictions to proceed but regulating the time, place and manner of those processes. In addition, the federal government can limit hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands through permitting, including by limiting the amount of lands available to lease or increasing royalty rates. The current administration cancelled the construction permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would have transported Canadian oil to the Gulf Coast. We do not currently expect that the recent executive branch actions regarding leases on public land or the cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline will have a material impact on our business in the short term. Various studies also have been conducted or are currently underway by the EPA, and other federal agencies concerning the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities. State and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and natural gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute 

 

to seismic activity. At the same time, certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly limit or otherwise regulate the hydraulic fracturing process, and legislation has been proposed by some members of Congress to provide for such regulation.

The adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal or state levels prohibiting, limiting or otherwise regulating the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult, or even impossible, to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our customers’ costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our products and services. In addition, heightened political, regulatory, and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly, or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. We could be directly affected by adverse litigation involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate. Such costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our products and services, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2022, we had 262 employees of which 228 are full-time employees. As of such date, 145 of our employees were based in the United States, 107 were based in Canada and ten were based outside of North America. Our international operations, with the exception of our Argentinean and certain North Sea operations, are currently serviced by employees operating out of the United States and Canada. In addition, our consolidated joint venture, Repeat Precision, has 208 employees, 23 of which are based in the United States and 185 of which are based in Mexico. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements in North America, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
