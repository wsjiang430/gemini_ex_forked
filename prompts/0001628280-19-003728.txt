ITEM 1. BUSINESS
We are Capital Bancorp, Inc., a bank holding company and a Maryland corporation, operating primarily through our wholly owned subsidiary, Capital Bank, N.A., a commercial-focused community bank based in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas. We serve businesses, not-for-profit associations and entrepreneurs throughout the region. Capital Bank is headquartered in Rockville, Maryland and operates a branch-lite model through five commercial bank branches, four mortgage offices, one loan production office, a limited service branch, corporate offices and operations facilities located in key markets throughout our operating area. As of December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $1.1 billion, total loans held for investment of $1.0 billion, total deposits of $955 million, and total stockholders’ equity of $115 million.
Capital Bank currently operates three divisions: Commercial Banking, Church Street Mortgage, or CSM, and OpenSky®. Our Commercial Banking division operates in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas and focuses on providing personalized service to commercial clients throughout our area of operations. Church Street Mortgage and OpenSky® both leverage Capital Bank’s national banking charter to operate as national consumer business lines; Church Street Mortgage acts as our residential mortgage origination platform and OpenSky® provides nationwide, digitally-based, secured credit cards to under-banked populations and those looking to rebuild their credit scores.
In addition to the three divisions of Capital Bank, Church Street Capital, or CSC, also operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Capital Bancorp, Inc. CSC originates and services a portfolio of mezzanine loans with certain characteristics that do not meet Capital Bank’s general underwriting standards and thereby command a higher rate of return. CSC typically retains 10% to 20% of the exposure related to these loans and continues to service them, thereby maintaining a close relationship with the customer. CSC sells participations for the remainder of the balance to other real estate investors (including certain of the Company’s and the Bank’s directors) and high net worth individuals. All participations sold to directors were sold on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to unaffiliated third parties. For additional information on participations sold to our directors, please see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Loan Participations with the Bank.” At December 31, 2018, the net portfolio of retained loans for CSC amounted to approximately $2.6 million. All of these loans were originated in our operating markets in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas. 
In addition to its subsidiaries discussed above, Capital Bank, N.A. and Church Street Capital, Capital Bancorp, Inc. owns all of the stock of Capital Bancorp (MD) Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”). The Trust is a special purpose non-consolidated entity organized for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. 
Commercial Banking Division
As of December 31, 2018, our Commercial Banking division accounted for approximately 94%, or $1.0 billion, of Capital Bank’s total assets. The Commercial Banking division operates out of three full service 

5

banking locations in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”) and its full service banking location of Columbia, Maryland in the Baltimore, Maryland MSA. Additionally, we have two loan production offices located throughout the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas. Our Commercial Banking division’s nine commercial loan officers and three commercial real estate loan officers provide commercial and industrial, or C&I, commercial real estate and construction lending solutions to business clients in Capital Bank’s operating markets. 
Construction lending is a core competency of our Commercial Banking division. Construction loans have increased from $100.8 million as of December 31, 2013 to $157.6 million as of December 31, 2018. However, as a percent of total gross loans, construction loans have decreased from 25% as of December 31, 2013 to 16% as of December 31, 2018. Our construction loan portfolio provides Capital Bank with short duration and higher yield loans. Our construction lending is focused on commercial and residential construction projects within the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, Maryland metropolitan operating areas and not suburban subdivision tract development. Our construction lending team consists of long-term employees of Capital Bank who are responsible for sourcing and structuring all construction loans that are originated. Our team’s strong underwriting capabilities are demonstrated by the fact that we have had no charge-offs on our construction portfolio since 2013.
In addition to its loan officers, our Commercial Banking division currently has a team of ten business development officers concentrating on continuing to diversify Capital Bank’s funding sources away from wholesale funding and towards core deposit funding by focusing on core deposits and treasury management. These business development officers, in conjunction with our recently introduced incentive program based upon core deposit capture from lending customers, have successfully reduced Capital Bank’s net non-core funding dependence ratio from 24.1% at December 31, 2014 to 17.4% at December 31, 2018. We expect that our deposit gathering teams will continue to help decrease our wholesale funding dependence through improved low-cost core funding.
Church Street Mortgage Division
Church Street Mortgage originates conventional and government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans on a national basis, for sale into the secondary market and in certain, limited circumstances for our loan portfolio. Loans sold into the secondary market are sold servicing released. Loans retained for our portfolio are generally adjustable rate mortgage loans on primary residences within Capital Bank’s operating markets to individuals who own businesses where Capital Bank may also pursue a commercial lending relationship and has a vested interest in maintaining full control of the lending relationship. 
The following table presents, for the periods indicated, certain loan origination data for Church Street Mortgage.

Historically, Church Street Mortgage has relied heavily on refinance origination volume as opposed to purchase origination volume. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, purchase origination volume accounted for approximately 23% and 19%, respectively, of Church Street Mortgage’s origination volume. However, anticipating the potential end of the refinance trends based on the expected interest rate 

6

environment as the Federal Reserve began increasing short-term interest rates, Church Street Mortgage initiated an effort to broaden its mortgage product suite (including starting its Community Lending Group focused on supporting first time home buyers and a group focused on originating loans conforming to the specifications of Fannie Mae’s HomeStyle® Renovation Mortgage program) and to focus on hiring mortgage loan officers concentrated on purchase origination volume. These efforts resulted in our successfully hiring 8 new mortgage loan officers during calendar year 2017 and transitioning from 19% purchase origination volume for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 79% purchase origination volume for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Approximately 70% of Church Street Mortgage’s originations by volume occur within Capital Bank’s operating markets in Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. The remainder of originations are national in scope and occur primarily through a consumer direct channel utilizing consumer marketing, including through social media applications. 
OpenSky® Secured Credit Card Division
The OpenSky® division provides secured credit cards (with a minimum initial deposit of $200 and maximum initial deposits of $3,000 per card and $5,000 per individual) on a nationwide basis to under-banked populations and those looking to rebuild their credit scores. In order to obtain a credit card from us, the customer must select a credit line amount that they are willing to secure with a matching deposit amount. A deposit equal to the full credit limit of the card is made, using a debit card, check, wire or Western Union transfer, into a noninterest-bearing demand account with the Bank when the account is opened and the deposit is required to be maintained throughout the life of the card. The customer’s funding of the deposit account as collateral is not a consideration in the credit card approval process, but is a prerequisite to activating the credit line. Credit card eligibility is based on identity and income verification. Once the customer’s deposit account has been funded, the credit line is activated and the collateral funds are generally available to absorb any losses on the account that may occur. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 11% of our credit card portfolio was delinquent by 30 days or more. Based on our prior experience, approximately 20% of our new secured credit cards will experience a charge-off within the first year of issuance primarily due to the relative inexperience of this under-banked population in effectively managing credit card debt.
Additionally, using our proprietary scoring model, which considers credit score and repayment history (typically a minimum of six months of on-time repayments, but ultimately determined on a case-by-case basis), the Bank has recently begun to offer certain customers an unsecured line in excess of their secured line of credit. OpenSky® secured credit cards have floating interest rates, which are beneficial in a rising rate environment, and we believe the OpenSky® secured credit card product provides a counter-cyclical benefit as more people enter its target segment of credit rebuilders during an economic downturn. At December 31, 2018, we had $2.1 million of unsecured unused lines of credit and $1.8 million of outstanding unsecured credit card advances.

Credit Card Loans and Deposits ($ in millions) | Open Credit Card Accounts and Average Monthly Account Openings


Capital Bank evaluates its OpenSky® customers using analytics that track consumer behaviors and score each customer on risk and behavior metrics. These real-time monitoring capabilities give our management insight into the credit trends of our portfolio on a consumer by consumer basis, allowing them to identify potential fraud situations and mitigate any associated losses quickly and efficiently, as well as to obtain insights into how to optimize the profitability and life cycle of each account. The model utilizes data proprietary to Capital Bank. We have invested heavily in technology and systems to prevent and detect fraudulent behavior and mitigate losses but such investments may not be adequate, and our systems may not adequately monitor or mitigate potential losses arising from these risks. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Delinquencies and credit losses from our OpenSky® credit card division could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
OpenSky®’s cards operate on a fully digital and mobile platform with all marketing and application procedures conducted through its website or mobile application. Given the secured nature of the cards, credit checks are not required at the time of application, however, as each customer’s account ages, we obtain credit scores to baseline their improvement as an input into any decision to extend unsecured credit in the future.

Our Business Strategy
Regulations, technology and competition have fundamentally impacted the economics of the banking sector. We believe that by using technology-enabled strategies and advice-based solutions, we can deliver attractive shareholder returns in excess of our cost of capital.

Summary Demographic and Other Market Data
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland MSAs include the four wealthiest counties in the United States, as well as five of the 10 wealthiest counties. Overall, the Washington, D.C. MSA ranks first out of the largest 20 MSAs (ranked by population) in income levels with a current median household income of approximately $99,400, which is approximately 63% higher than the national average. Additionally, the Washington, D.C. MSA is currently the sixth largest MSA in the United States with a total population of more than 6.2 million people (and when combined with the Baltimore, Maryland MSA, the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas are home to a population of more than 9.0 million).

The Washington, D.C. MSA has a large and diversified economy, with an annual gross domestic product of nearly $510 billion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. When combined with the Baltimore, Maryland MSA, the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas in which we operate has a combined gross domestic product of more than $696 billion, and this combined GDP has grown approximately 19% between 2010 and 2016. The Washington, D.C. MSA is a desirable market for a broad range of companies in a variety of industries, including 15 companies from the 2017 Fortune 500 list, and four of the United States’ largest 100 private companies, according to the 2017 Forbes list of largest private companies by revenue. The following table provides an in-depth view of the distribution of employment within the Washington, D.C. MSA.

Washington, D.C. MSA Employment By Sector
_______________
Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; Data as of February 2018
Note: Data not seasonally adjusted
As the home of the federal government, the broader Washington, D.C. region benefits from consistent population growth and remains well positioned to capitalize on any increase in government spending and infrastructure. Further, as banks in our market have experienced continued consolidation over the last few years, our opportunities to attract talented employees and capitalize on customer dislocation have increased. 
With its strong demographic characteristics, scale and robust economic activity we believe that the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas represent a strong geographic market for us to realize our continued growth strategies within our Commercial Banking division. The Washington, D.C. area serves as a regional, national and global center for several industries, including:
Government Contracting

• | The Washington, D.C. metro area received $70 billion in government contracting awards from October 2015 to September 2016, according to data from USASpending.gov. We expect the region to benefit from anticipated increases in government contract spending under the Trump administration.


11


• | According to the Annual Review of Government Contracting of the National Contract Management Association, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia represent three of the top five markets in the United States for annual government contracts awarded in 2015.


• | The Washington, D.C. MSA is home to some of the largest defense contracting companies in the world, including Lockheed Martin (Bethesda, Maryland) and General Dynamics (Falls Church, Virginia).

Hospitality and Tourism

• | The Washington, D.C. MSA is home to three of the world’s largest hotel and resort chains, Marriott International, Inc. (Bethesda, Maryland), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (McLean, Virginia) and Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (Bethesda, Maryland).


• | Worldwide interest in Washington, D.C.’s monuments, museums, diverse neighborhoods drives a strong interest in tourism in the area. According to the Associated Press, the area was visited by more than 22 million domestic and international tourists in 2016. The high volume of tourists contributed to $7.3 billion of spending in the area in 2016, an increase of 2.8% from 2015. The tourism industry supports 74,000 jobs in Washington, D.C., according to Destination DC.

In addition to their diverse economies, we believe the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan areas provide a favorable environment for economic strength going forward. As the home of the federal government, the broader Washington, D.C. region benefits from consistent population growth and remains well positioned to capitalize on any increase in government spending and infrastructure. Further, as banks in our market have experienced continued consolidation over the last few years, our opportunities to attract talented employees and capitalize on customer dislocation have increased. Thirteen bank mergers in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland MSAs have been announced or completed since the start of 2016. With the shrinking number of locally headquartered community banks (seven of the top 10 banks in Washington, D.C. MSA by market share are not headquartered in the region), we believe that we have the ability to continue our historical growth by serving the middle market businesses and their owners in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland MSAs who prefer high quality service and local decision making that is unavailable at larger, out-of-market banking institutions. 
With its unique demographic characteristics, scale and robust economic activity, we believe that the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas are a strong geographic market in which we can realize our continued growth strategies for our Commercial Banking division.
Lending Activities
Overview. We maintain a diversified loan portfolio of types of loan products and customer characteristics with a focus on variable rate, shorter term and higher yielding products. Our lending services cover residential and commercial real estate loans, both on an owner and non-owner-occupied basis, construction loans, commercial business loans and credit card lines (substantially all of which are secured by a deposit at the Bank in an amount equal to the full credit limit of the credit card). Lending activities originate from the efforts of our bankers, with an emphasis on lending to individuals, professionals, small- to medium-sized businesses and commercial companies located in our market areas.

The following table presents the composition of our total loan portfolio, by category, as of December 31, 2018.
LOAN PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION

Loan Composition | | | 
(Dollars in thousands) | Amount | | Percentage of Total Loans
Real estate: | | | 
Residential | $ | 407,844 | | | 41 | %
Commercial | 278,691 | | | 28 | 
Construction | 157,586 | | | 16 | 
Subtotal real estate | 844,121 | | | 85 |

Credit card | 34,673 | | | 3 | 
Other consumer | 1,202 | | | — | 
Total | $ | 1,002,260 | | | 100.0 | %

Residential Real Estate Loans. We offer one-to-four family mortgage loans primarily on owner-occupied primary residences and, to a lesser extent, investor owned residences. We also offer home equity lines of credit. Our residential real estate lending products are offered primarily to customers within our geographic markets. Our owner-occupied residential real estate loans usually have fixed rates for five or seven years and adjust on an annual basis after the initial term based on a typical maturity of 30 years. Our investor residential real estate loans are based on 25-year amortization terms with a balloon payment due after five years. The required minimum debt service coverage ratio is 1.15. 
Commercial Real Estate Loans. We offer real estate loans for commercial property that is owner-occupied as well as commercial property owned by real estate investors. Commercial loans that are secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate and primarily collateralized by operating cash flows are also included in this category of loans. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $128.9 million of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, representing approximately 46% of our commercial real estate portfolio. Commercial real estate loan terms are generally extended for 10 years or less and amortize generally over 25 years or less. The interest rates on our commercial real estate loans have initial fixed rate terms that adjust typically at 5 years and we routinely charge an origination fee for our services. We generally require personal guarantees from the principal owners of the business supported by a review of the principal owners’ personal financial statements and global debt service obligations. The real estate securing our existing commercial real estate loans includes a wide variety of property types, such as owner-occupied offices, warehouses, production facilities, office buildings, mixed-use residential/commercial property, retail centers and multifamily properties. 
Construction Loans. Our construction loan portfolio primarily includes loans to builders for the construction of single-family homes and condominium and townhouse conversions or renovations and, to a lesser extent, loans to individual clients for construction of owner-occupied single-family homes in our market areas. Construction loans are generally made with a term of 12 to 18 months. According to our underwriting standards, the ratio of loan principal to collateral value, as established by an independent appraisal, cannot exceed 75% for investor-owned and 80% for owner-occupied properties. Loan proceeds are disbursed based on the completion of certain milestones and only after the project has been inspected by an experienced construction lender or third-party inspector.
Commercial Business Loans. In addition to our other loan products, we provide general commercial loans, including commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, term loans, equipment financing, letters of credit and other loan products, primarily in our target markets, that are underwritten based on each borrower’s ability to service debt from income. We typically take as collateral a lien on general business 

13

assets including, among other things, available real estate, accounts receivable, promissory notes, inventory and equipment and we generally obtain a personal guaranty from the borrower or other principal. Other than lines of credit, our commercial loans generally have fixed interest rates and five or seven year terms depending on factors such as the type and size of the loan, the financial strength of the borrower/guarantor and the age, type and value of the collateral. 
Credit Cards. Through our OpenSky® credit card division, we provide credit cards on a nationwide basis to under-banked populations and those looking to rebuild their credit scores through a fully digital and mobile platform. Substantially all of the lines of credit are secured by a noninterest bearing demand account at the Bank in an amount equal to the full credit limit of the credit card. In addition, using our proprietary scoring model, which considers credit score and repayment history (typically a minimum of six months of on-time repayments, but ultimately determined on a case-by-case basis) the Bank has recently begun to offer certain customers an unsecured line in excess of their secured line of credit.
Other Consumer Loans. To a very limited extent, we also make loans to individuals, including secured and unsecured installment and term loans, car loans and boat loans. We offer consumer loans as an accommodation to our existing customers and do not market consumer loans to persons who do not have a pre-existing relationship with us. 
Credit Policies and Procedures
General. We maintain asset quality through an emphasis on local market knowledge, long-term customer relationships, consistent and thorough underwriting for all loans and a conservative credit culture. Our lending policies do not provide for any loans that are highly speculative, subprime or that have high loan-to-value ratios. These components, together with active credit management, are the foundation of our credit culture.
We have a service-driven, relationship-based, business-focused credit culture, rather than a price-driven, transaction-based culture. Substantially all of our commercial loans are made to borrowers located or operating in our primary market areas with whom we have ongoing relationships across various product lines. We only have a limited number of loans secured by properties located in out-of-market areas.
Credit Concentrations. We actively manage the composition of our loan portfolio, including credit concentrations. Our loan approval policies establish concentrations limits with respect to loan product types to enhance portfolio diversification. The Bank’s concentration management program couples quantitative data with a qualitative approach to provide an in-depth understanding of its loan portfolio concentrations. The Bank’s routine commercial real estate portfolio analysis includes concentration trends by portfolio product type, overall commercial real estate growth trends, pool correlations, risk rating trends, policy and/or underwriting exceptions, non-performing trends, stress testing, market and submarket analysis and changing economic conditions. The portfolio concentration limits set forth in Bank’s Credit Underwriting Guidelines are reviewed and approved by the Loan Committee of the Bank’s board of directors at least annually and are based on risk profile, strategic portfolio diversification goals, quality of the portfolio segment, overall budgeted growth goals and comparisons to peers of the Bank. Concentration levels are monitored by management and reported to the Bank’s board of directors monthly. 
Loan Approval Process. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had a legal lending limit of approximately $16.1 million for loans secured without readily marketable collateral, and its “in-house” lending limit was $12.5 million as of such date. The Bank’s lending activities are governed by written underwriting policies and procedures that have been approved by the Loan Committee of the Bank’s board of directors. The policies provide several levels of delegated lending authority to the Management Loan Committee, the Credit Loan Committee and senior management and loan officers of the Bank. The lending authority hierarchy varies depending on loan amount, collateral type and total borrower exposure. A multi-tiered group level approach based on experience, capability and management position dictates lending authorities for senior management and loan officers. 

14

We conduct weekly loan meetings, attended by substantially all of our loan officers, related loan production staff and credit administration staff at which asset quality and delinquencies are reviewed. Our evaluation and compensation program for our loan officers includes significant goals, such as the percentages of past due loans and charge-offs to total loans in the loan officer’s portfolio, that we believe motivate loan officers to focus on the origination and maintenance of high quality credits consistent with our strategic focus on asset quality.
It is our policy to discuss each loan that has one or more past due payment at our weekly meetings with all lending personnel. Our policies require rapid notification of delinquency and prompt initiation of collection actions. Loan officers, credit administration personnel and senior management proactively support collection activities.
In accordance with our procedures, we perform annual asset reviews of our loan exposures in excess of $100,000. As part of these asset review procedures, we analyze recent financial statements of the property, borrower and any guarantor to determine the current level of occupancy, revenues and expenses and to investigate any deterioration in the value of the real estate collateral or in the borrower’s and any guarantor’s financial condition. Upon completion, we update the grade assigned to each loan. Loan officers are encouraged to bring potential credit issues to the attention of credit administration personnel. We maintain a list of loans that receive additional attention if we believe there may be a potential credit risk.
Loans in excess of $250,000 that are downgraded or classified undergo a detailed quarterly review by the Special Asset Committee of the Bank’s board of directors. This review includes an evaluation of market conditions, the property’s trends, the borrower and guarantor status, the level of reserves required and loan accrual status. Additionally, we periodically have an independent, third-party review performed on our loan grades and our credit administration functions. Finally, we perform an annual stress test of our loan portfolio during which we evaluate the impact of declining economic conditions on the portfolio based on previous recessionary periods. Management reviews these reports and presents them to the Loan Committee of the Bank’s board of directors. These asset review procedures provide management with additional information for assessing our asset quality. In addition, we perform frequent evaluations and regular monitoring of business and personal loans that are not secured by real estate.
Deposits
Our deposits serve as the primary funding source for lending, investing and other general banking purposes. We provide a full range of deposit products and services, including a variety of checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, debit cards, remote deposit capture, online banking, mobile banking, e-Statements, bank-by-mail and direct deposit services. We also offer business accounts and cash management services, including business checking and savings accounts and treasury management services. We solicit deposits through our relationship-driven team of dedicated and accessible bankers and through community-focused marketing. We also selectively seek to cross-sell deposit products at loan origination. We supplement our retail deposits with wholesale funding sources such as deposit listing services, CDARS and brokered deposits. We actively market our certificate of deposit products and rely primarily on competitive pricing policies to attract and retain these deposits. Our credit card customers are also a signification source of deposits.
Residential Mortgage Origination
We originate residential mortgages for sale on the secondary market through Church Street Mortgage, the mortgage division of our Bank. We have developed a scalable platform for mortgage originations within this division and believe that we have significant opportunities to grow the business. We sell substantially all mortgage loans we originate with servicing released to various investors in the secondary market. As a result of recent changes in the interest rate environment, our mortgage division is currently undergoing a transition from being heavily weighted toward refinance volume to being more weighted toward purchase volume and niche products with relatively higher margins. As part of this effort, we have recently established 

15

our Community Lending Group, which focuses on first-time home buyers, and our Renovation Group, which focuses on originating renovation focused loans, within the division, as well as hiring several new originators focused primarily on purchase originations. At December 31, 2018, we had a dedicated team of 33 mortgage loan officers to service this line of business.
Investments
We manage our securities portfolio and cash to maintain adequate liquidity and to ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal, with a secondary focus on yield and returns. Specific goals of our investment portfolio are as follows:

• | to provide a ready source of balance sheet liquidity, ensuring adequate availability of funds to meet fluctuations in loan demand, deposit balances and other changes in balance sheet volumes and composition;


• | to serve as a means for diversification of our assets with respect to credit quality, maturity and other attributes; and


• | to serve as a tool for modifying our interest rate risk profile pursuant to our established policies.

Our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of U.S. government agency securities, high quality corporate debt, mortgage-backed securities backed by government-sponsored entities and equity securities.
Our investment policy is reviewed annually by our Asset/Liability Management Committee, or ALCO, and subsequently ratified by our board of directors. Overall investment goals are established by our board, CEO, CFO and members of our ALCO. Our board of directors has delegated the responsibility of monitoring our investment activities to our ALCO. Day-to-day activities pertaining to the securities portfolio are conducted under the supervision of our CFO. We actively monitor our investments on an ongoing basis to identify any material changes in our mix of securities. We also review our securities for potential impairment (other than temporary impairments) at least quarterly.
Competition
The banking and financial services industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a wide range of financial institutions within our markets, including local, regional and national commercial banks and credit unions. We also compete with mortgage companies, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, mutual funds, securities firms, insurance companies, credit card companies, third-party payment processors, financial technology, or fintech, companies and other financial intermediaries for certain of our products and services. Some of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions and level of regulatory supervision applicable to us.
Interest rates on loans and deposits, as well as prices on fee-based services, are typically significant competitive factors within banking and financial services industry. Many of our competitors are much larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources than we do and compete aggressively for market share. These competitors attempt to gain market share through their financial product mix, pricing strategies and banking center locations. Other important competitive factors in our industry and markets include office locations and hours, quality of customer service, community reputation, continuity of personnel and services, capacity and willingness to extend credit, and ability to offer sophisticated banking products and services. While we seek to remain competitive with respect to fees charged, interest rates and pricing, we believe that our broad and sophisticated commercial banking product suite, our high quality customer service culture, our positive reputation and long-standing community relationships will enable us to compete successfully within our markets and enhance our ability to attract and retain customers.

Our Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 204 full-time equivalent persons. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
General
We are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. These laws restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with various consumer protection provisions applicable to lending, deposit, brokerage, and fiduciary activities. They also impose capital adequacy requirements and conditions on a bank holding company’s, or BHC, ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from its subsidiary banks. We are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve, and the Bank is subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or the OCC. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve quarterly and annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve may conduct examinations of BHCs and their subsidiaries. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, through the Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF. As a result of this deposit insurance function, the FDIC also has certain supervisory authority and powers over the Bank as well as all other FDIC insured institutions. The Company’s and the Bank’s regulators generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations. Bank regulation is intended to protect depositors and consumers and not shareholders. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct and profitability of our activities.
To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on us, are difficult to ascertain. A change in applicable laws and regulations, or in the manner such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material effect on our business, operations, and earnings.
Regulation of Capital Bancorp, Inc.
We are registered as a BHC under the BHC Act and are subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. The BHC Act requires us to secure the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before we own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank or thrift, or merge or consolidate with another bank or thrift holding company. Further, under the BHC Act, our activities and those of any nonbank subsidiary are limited to: (i) those activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, and (ii) investments in companies not engaged in activities closely related to banking, subject to quantitative limitations on the value of such investments. Prior approval of the Federal Reserve may be required before engaging in certain activities. In making such determinations, the Federal Reserve is required to weigh the expected benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, and gains in efficiency, against the possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound banking practices.
Subject to various exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a BHC. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the BHC, and a rebuttable presumption arises if a person or company acquires 10% or 

17

more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities and either: (i) the BHC has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act; or (ii) no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. As a policy matter, the Federal Reserve expects a company that proposes to acquire more than 7.5% but less than 25% of a class of voting securities to consult with the agency. The Federal Reserve Board may require the company to enter into passivity and, if other companies are making similar investments, anti-association commitments.
The BHC Act was substantially amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or the GLBA, which, among other things, permits a “financial holding company” to engage in a broader range of non-banking activities, and to engage on less restrictive terms in certain activities than were previously permitted. These expanded activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and sales, and merchant banking activities. To become a financial holding company, a BHC must certify that it and all depository institutions that it controls are both “well capitalized” and “well managed” (as defined by federal law), and that all subsidiary depository institutions have at least a “satisfactory” CRA rating. At this time, we have not elected to become a financial holding company, nor do we expect to make such an election in the foreseeable future.
There are a number of restrictions imposed on us by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to depositors and to the DIF in the event that a subsidiary depository institution should become insolvent. For example, federal law requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so in the absence of the rule. The Federal Reserve also has the authority under the BHC Act to require a BHC to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary upon the Federal Reserve’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the BHC.
Any capital loan by a BHC to a subsidiary depository institution is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the institution. In addition, in the event of the BHC’s bankruptcy, any commitment made by the BHC to a federal banking regulatory agency to maintain the capital of its subsidiary depository institution(s) will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDIA, provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as a subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the institution’s holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
Regulation of Capital Bank
The operations and investments of our Bank are subject to the supervision, examination, and reporting requirements of the National Bank Act and the regulations of the OCC as well as other federal banking statutes and regulations, including with respect to the level of reserves that our Bank must maintain against deposits, restrictions on the types, amount, and terms and conditions of loans it may originate, and limits on the types of other activities in which our Bank may engage and the investments that it may make. The OCC also has the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Because our Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law, it is also subject to certain FDIC regulations, and the FDIC has backup examination authority and some enforcement powers over our Bank. If, as a result of an examination of our Bank, the regulators should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of the Bank’s operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or our management is 

18

violating or has violated any law or regulation, various remedies are available to the regulators. Such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices, require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, direct an increase in capital, to restrict growth, assess civil monetary penalties and remove officers and directors. The regulators also may request the FDIC to terminate the Bank’s deposit insurance.
Regulatory Relief Act
On May 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Regulatory Relief Act, which amends parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act, as well as other laws that involve regulation of the financial industry. While the Regulatory Relief Act keeps in place fundamental aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act’s regulatory framework, it does change the regulatory framework for depository institutions with assets under $10 billion, such as the Bank, and for large depository institutions with assets over $50 billion. The legislation includes a number of provisions which are favorable to BHCs with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Company, and also makes changes to consumer mortgage and credit reporting regulations and to the authorities of the agencies that regulate the financial industry. A number of the provisions included in the Regulatory Relief Act require the federal banking agencies to either promulgate regulations or amend existing regulations, and it will likely take some time for these agencies to implement the necessary changes.
The following is a brief summary of select provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act which are not otherwise covered in other sections below.
Modified Process for Designating Systemically Important Financial Institutions. The Regulatory Relief Act changes which BHCs will be designated as “Systemically Important Financial Institutions” or SIFIs. Prior to passage of the Regulatory Relief Act, all BHCs with assets exceeding $50 billion were automatically designated as SIFIs and were subject to the enhanced prudential standards, or EPS of the Dodd-Frank Act, which required these BHCs to undergo special stress tests, develop resolution plans, and maintain certain levels of liquidity and financial capacity to absorb losses. The Regulatory Relief Act raised the $50 billion “SIFI threshold” to $250 billion, but staggered the application of this change for certain institutions, based on the size of the BHC. Upon enactment, BHCs with total consolidated assets of less than $100 billion are no longer subject to the EPS of the Dodd-Frank Act. BHCs with total consolidated assets of more than $100 billion but less than $250 billion will no longer be subject to such requirements, beginning 18 months after the date of enactment. During the 18-month transition period, the Federal Reserve may exempt a BHC from any EPS requirement, and the Federal Reserve is also provided with discretionary authority to apply any EPS to a BHC within this asset category, subject to it following specified procedural requirements. BHCs with more than $250 billion in consolidated assets, as well as any domestic BHC that has been identified as a “global systemically important” BHC, remain fully subject to EPS. Because the Regulatory Relief Act does not amend the regulations that the federal banking agencies have promulgated to implement the EPS, it will likely take some time for these agencies to amend their regulations to account for the new thresholds included in the Regulatory Relief Act.
Many of the changes in the Regulatory Relief Act amend provisions of Dodd-Frank Act that apply at the BHC level, but not to subsidiary national banks or other insured depository institutions. The OCC and the FDIC have adopted their own counterparts to some EPS for the bank subsidiaries that they regulate, including recovery and resolution planning. The OCC and the FDIC will need to address whether they intend to take similar measures under their regulations and guidance to align asset thresholds with what is reflected in the Regulatory Relief Act.
Provisions that are Favorable to Community Banks. There are a number of provisions in the Regulatory Relief Act that will have a favorable impact on community banks such as the Bank. These are briefly referenced below.

19

Elimination of Company-Run Stress Tests. The Regulatory Relief Act exempts all banking organizations-including not only BHCs, but also depository institutions and savings and loan holding companies, or SLHCs, with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets from the current requirement to conduct company-run stress tests. Banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets are still required to conduct company-run stress tests on a periodic basis but are no longer be required to do so on a semi-annual or annual basis.
Increase in Small BHC Policy Threshold. The threshold for qualifying for the Federal Reserve’s “Small BHC Policy Statement”, or the Policy, is increased by the Regulatory Relief Act from $1 billion to $3 billion, provided the small BHC or SLHC is not engaged in significant non-banking activities, is not engaged in significant off-balance sheet activities and does not have a material amount of debt or equity registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The Federal Reserve retains the authority to exclude any BHC or SLHC from the Policy if such action is warranted for supervisory purposes. The Policy allows covered holding companies to operate with higher levels of debt than would normally be permitted. Also, holding companies that are subject to the Policy are exempt from the Federal Reserve’s consolidated risk-based and leverage capital rules and have less extensive regulatory reporting requirements than larger organizations. Specifically, they file semi-annual rather than quarterly reports. Companies that are subject to the Policy are not to pay dividends if their debt-to-equity ratio exceeds 1:1. In addition, the Federal Reserve expects that holding companies will retire all debt within 25 years and reduce debt to 30 percent or less of equity within 12 years of incurring the debt. The foregoing requirements are intended to ensure that the higher leverage the Policy allows does not pose an undue burden on subsidiary depository institutions. Finally, the Policy directs that each depository institution subsidiary of a covered holding company remain well-capitalized.
Increase in Asset Threshold for Requirement to Establish a Risk Committee. The Regulatory Relief Act raises the asset threshold for the requirement that a publicly-traded BHC establish a risk committee from $10 billion to $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets.
Increase in Asset Threshold for Qualifying for an 18-Month Examination Cycle. The Regulatory Relief Act increases the asset threshold for institutions qualifying for an 18-month on-site examination cycle from $1 billion to $3 billion in total consolidated assets.
Short Form Call Reports. The Regulatory Relief Act requires the federal banking agencies to promulgate regulations allowing an insured depository institution with less than $5 billion in total consolidated assets (and that satisfies such other criteria as determined to be appropriate by the agencies) to submit a short-form call report for its first and third quarters of a calendar year.
Consumer Protection Enhancements. The Regulatory Relief Act includes various provisions to address consumer protection challenges facing the credit reporting industry and borrowers in certain credit markets, specifically markets including active duty service members, veterans, and student loan borrowers. The Regulatory Relief Act subjects credit reporting agencies to additional requirements, including requirements to generally provide fraud alerts for consumer files for at least one year and to allow consumers to place security freezes on their credit reports.
The Regulatory Relief Act also allows consumers to request that information related to a default on a qualified private student loan be removed from a credit report if the borrower satisfies the requirements of a loan rehabilitation program offered by a private lender. The Regulatory Relief Act prohibits lenders from declaring automatic default in the case of death or bankruptcy of the co-signer of a student loan and requires lenders to release cosigners from obligations related to a student loan in the event of the death of the student borrower. In addition, credit reporting agencies will be required to exclude certain medical debt from veterans’ credit reports.

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
We are subject to federal laws, such as Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, or FRA, that limit the size and number of the transactions that depository institutions may engage in with their affiliates. Under these provisions, transactions (such as loans or investments) by a bank with nonbank affiliates are generally limited to 10% of the bank’s capital and surplus for all covered transactions with any one affiliate, and 20% of capital and surplus for all covered transactions with all affiliates. Any extensions of credit to affiliates, with limited exceptions, must be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Banks are also prohibited from purchasing any “low quality” assets from an affiliate. The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the FRA, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of restrictions on loans to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivatives transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. The Federal Reserve has promulgated Regulation W, which codifies prior interpretations under Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA and provides interpretive guidance with respect to affiliate transactions. Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, a bank’s BHC and companies that are under common control with the bank. We are considered to be an affiliate of the Bank.
We are also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to our executive officers, directors, stockholders who own more than 10% of our common stock, and their related interests. These extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Loans to such persons and certain affiliated entities of any of the foregoing may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated entities, the institution’s loans-to-one-borrower limit. Federal regulations also prohibit loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency to directors, executive officers, stockholders who own more than 10% of an institution, and their respective affiliates, unless such loans are approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the institution. Any “interested” director may not participate in the vote. The proscribed loan amount, which includes all other outstanding loans to such person, as to which such prior board of director approval is required, is the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus up to $500,000. Furthermore, we are prohibited from engaging in asset purchases or sales transactions with our officers, directors, or principal stockholders unless the transaction is on market terms and, if the transaction represents greater than 10% of the capital and surplus of the Bank, a majority of the Bank’s disinterested directors has approved the transaction.
Indemnification payments to any director, officer or employee of either a bank or a BHC are subject to certain constraints imposed by the FDIC.
Incentive Compensation
Federal banking agencies have issued guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions (generally institutions that have over $1 billion in assets) and are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses.

21

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of its standard, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations (such as the Company) that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on executive compensation may continue to evolve in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the Company’s ability to hire, retain and motivate its key employees.
Deposit Insurance 
Our deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC. The DIF is the successor to the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund, which were merged in 2006. Deposit insurance is mandatory. We are required to pay assessments to the FDIC on a quarterly basis. The assessment amount is the product of multiplying the assessment base by the assessment amount.
The assessment base against which the assessment rate is applied to determine the total assessment due for a given period is the depository institution’s average total consolidated assets during the assessment period less average tangible equity during that assessment period. Tangible equity is defined in the assessment rule as Tier 1 Capital and is calculated monthly, unless the insured depository institution has less than $1 billion in assets, in which case the insured depository institution calculates Tier 1 Capital on an end-of-quarter basis. Parents or holding companies of other insured depository institutions are required to report separately from their subsidiary depository institutions.
The FDIC’s methodology for setting assessments for individual banks has changed over time, although the broad policy is that lower-risk institutions should pay lower assessments than higher-risk institutions. The FDIC now uses a methodology, known as the “financial ratios method,” that began to apply on July 1, 2016, in order to meet requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The statute established a minimum designated reserve ratio, or the DRR, for the DIF of 1.35% of the estimated insured deposits and required the FDIC to adopt a restoration plan should the reserve ratio fall below 1.35%. The financial ratios took effect when the DRR exceeded 1.15%. The FDIC declared that the DIF reserve ratio exceeded 1.15% by the end of the second quarter of 2016. Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2016, the FDIC began to use the financial ratios method. This methodology assigns a specific assessment rate to each institution based on the institution’s leverage capital, supervisory ratings, and information from the institution’s call report. Under this methodology, the assessment rate schedules used to determine assessments due from insured depository institutions become progressively lower when the reserve ratio in the DIF exceeds 2% and 2.5%.
In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, insured depository institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. This payment is established quarterly and, for the fourth quarter in calendar year 2018, equaled .32 basis points on assessable deposits. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also raised the limit for federal deposit insurance to $250,000 for most deposit accounts and increased the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100,000 to $250,000.
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance assessments would likely have an adverse effect on our operating expenses and results of operations. We 

22

cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. Furthermore, deposit insurance may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC.
Dividends
Capital Bancorp, Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from Capital Bank. Our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions depends in part upon the receipt of dividends from the Bank and is limited by federal and state law. The specific limits depend upon a number of factors, including the bank’s recent earnings, recent dividends, level of capital, and regulatory status. The regulators are authorized, and under certain circumstances are required, to determine that the payment of dividends or other distributions by a bank would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit that payment. For example, the FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Failure to satisfy the capital conservation buffer requirement may also result in limits on our ability to pay dividends. See “—Capital Adequacy Guidelines.”
A national bank generally may not withdraw, either in the form of a dividend or otherwise, any portion of its permanent capital and may not declare a dividend in excess of its retained net profits. Further, dividends that may be paid by a national bank without the express approval of the OCC are limited to an amount equal to the bank’s retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus retained net profits up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net income, less dividends declared during the period. Dividend payments by the Bank in the future will require the generation of net income and could require regulatory approval if any proposed dividends are in excess of prescribed guidelines.
 Capital Adequacy Guidelines 
In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, or Basel III. Basel III requires banks to maintain a higher level of capital than previously required, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed generally applicable capital requirements with respect to BHCs and their bank subsidiaries and mandated that the federal banking regulatory agencies adopt rules and regulations to implement the Basel III requirements.
Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to apply consolidated capital requirements to a BHC that are no less stringent than those currently applied to depository institutions. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule, or the Basel III Final Rule, implementing these standards. Under the Basel III Final Rule, trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier I capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a BHC with less than $15 billion in assets, subject to certain limits. The Dodd-Frank Act additionally provides for countercyclical capital requirements so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness. Under the Basel III Final Rule, which implements this concept, banks must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional common equity Tier 1 capital equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above each of the required minimum capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying certain discretionary bonuses. This new capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by this amount each year until fully implemented at 2.5% in January 2019. As of January 1, 2018, the capital conservation buffer had phased in to 1.875%.
For purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets, the federal banking agencies have promulgated risk-based capital guidelines designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposures, and to minimize disincentives for 

23

holding liquid assets. Under these guidelines, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items.
In addition, certain off-balance sheet items are assigned certain credit conversion factors to convert them to asset-equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk-weighting will apply. Those computations result in the total risk-weighted assets. Most loans are assigned to the 100% risk category, except for performing first mortgage loans fully secured by residential property, which carry a 50% risk weighting. Most investment securities (including, primarily, general obligation claims of states or other political subdivisions of the United States) are assigned to the 20% category. Exceptions include municipal or state revenue bonds, which have a 50% risk weighting, and direct obligations of the United States Treasury or obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which have a 0% risk weighting. In converting off-balance sheet items, direct credit substitutes, including general guarantees and standby letters of credit backing financial obligations, are given a 100% risk weighting. Transaction-related contingencies such as bid bonds, standby letters of credit backing non-financial obligations, and undrawn commitments (including commercial credit lines with an initial maturity of more than one year) have a 50% risk weighting. Short-term commercial letters of credit have a 20% risk weighting, and certain short-term unconditionally cancelable commitments have a 0% risk weighting.
Revised minimum capital standards for banks of our size took effect on January 1, 2015 with a phase-in period that generally extended through January 1, 2019 for certain of the changes.
Under the Basel III Final Rule, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. The required ratio of “Tier 1 Capital” (consisting generally of stockholders’ equity and qualifying preferred stock, less certain goodwill items and other intangible assets) to risk-weighted assets rose to 6% from the earlier 4%. While there was previously no required ratio of “Common Equity Tier 1 Capital,” or CET1 (which generally consists of common stock, retained earnings, certain qualifying capital instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries, and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, subject to certain adjustments) to risk-weighted assets, a required minimum ratio of 4.5% became effective on January 1, 2015 as well. The remainder of total capital, or Tier 2 Capital, may consist of (a) the allowance for loan losses of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, (b) preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 Capital, (c) hybrid capital instruments, (d) perpetual debt, (e) mandatory convertible securities, and (f) certain subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock up to 50% of Tier 1 Capital. Total Capital is the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital (which is included only to the extent of Tier 1 Capital), less reciprocal holdings of other banking organizations’ capital instruments, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and any other deductions as determined by the appropriate regulator.
During 2018, banking organizations, including the Bank, were required to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.375%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 7.875%, and a total capital ratio of at least 9.875% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments. The requirements were fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, including the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, and the Bank is now required to meet a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%, a minimum CET1 to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% and a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5%. In August of 2018 the Regulatory Relief Act directed the Federal Reserve Board to revise the Small BHC Policy Statement to raise the total consolidated asset limit in the Small BHC Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion. The Company was previously required to comply with the minimum capital requirements on a consolidated basis; however, the Company continues to meet the conditions of the revised Small BHC Policy Statement and was, therefore, exempt from the consolidated capital requirements at December 31, 2018.
The Basel III Final Rule also established minimum leverage ratio requirements for banking organizations, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average consolidated assets. Prior to the effective date of the Basel III Final Rule, banks and BHCs meeting certain specified criteria, including having the highest 

24

regulatory rating and not experiencing significant growth or expansion, were permitted to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average quarterly assets equal to 3%. Other banks and BHCs generally were required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio between 4% and 5%. Under the Basel III Final Rule, as of January 1, 2015, the required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4%. As discussed under “—Prompt Corrective Action,” depository institutions and depository holding companies with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company and the Bank, will be deemed to satisfy both the leverage and risk-based capital requirements, provided they satisfy a new “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” required to be promulgated by the federal banking agencies.
As an additional means of identifying problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the federal banking regulatory agencies have established certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure, and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.
The requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act are still in the process of being implemented over time and most will be subject to regulations implemented over the course of several years. In addition, the Regulatory Relief Act modifies a number of provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, but are subject to implementing regulations. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Regulatory Relief Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear. On August 25, 2017, the federal banking agencies proposed an extension of the transition period for application of the Basel III-based capital rules to certain investments. If the proposed extension of the transition period is finalized substantially as proposed in August 2017, the capital treatment proposed therein would remain effective until such time as the changes proposed in the new rule proposal would be finalized and effective. On September 27, 2017, the federal banking agencies proposed a rule intended to reduce the regulatory compliance burden, particularly on community banking organizations, by simplifying several requirements in the Basel III-based capital rules. Specifically, the proposed rule simplifies the capital treatment for certain acquisition, development, and construction loans, mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interest. The Regulatory Relief Act addressed the capital treatment of certain acquisition, development and construction loans. See “—Commercial Real Estate Concentration Guidelines.”
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms, which standards are commonly referred to as Basel IV. Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including the recalibration of the risk weights and the introduction of new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Bank. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators.
Commercial Real Estate Concentration Guidelines
In December 2006, the federal banking regulators issued guidance entitled “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices” to address increased concentrations in commercial real estate, or CRE, loans. In addition, in December 2015, the federal bank agencies issued additional guidance entitled “Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending.” Together, these guidelines describe the criteria the agencies will use as indicators to identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. An institution that has (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land representing 100% or more of the institution’s capital, or (iv) total non-owner-

25

occupied CRE (including construction) loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s capital, and the outstanding balance of the institutions CRE portfolio has increased by 50% or more in the prior 36 months, may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its CRE concentration risk. 
Currently, loans categorized as “high-volatility commercial real estate,” or HVCRE, loans are required to be assigned a 150% risk weight, and require additional capital support. HVCRE loans are defined to include any credit facility that finances or has financed the acquisition, development or construction of real property, unless it finances: 1-4 family residential properties; certain community development investments; agricultural land used or usable for, and whose value is based on, agricultural use; or commercial real estate projects in which (i) the loan to value is less than the applicable maximum supervisory loan to value ratio established by the bank regulatory agencies, (ii) the borrower has contributed cash or unencumbered readily marketable assets, or has paid development expenses out of pocket, equal to at least 15% of the appraised “as completed” value, (iii) the borrower contributes its 15% before the bank advances any funds and (iv) the capital contributed by the borrower, and any funds internally generated by the project, are contractually required to remain in the project until the facility is converted to permanent financing, sold or paid in full.
The Regulatory Relief Act prohibits federal banking agencies from assigning heightened risk weights to HVCRE exposures, unless the exposures are classified as HVCRE acquisition, development and construction loans. The Federal banking agencies issued a proposal in September 2017 to simplify the treatment of HVCRE and to create a new category of commercial real estate loans called “high-volatility acquisition, development or construction,” or HVADC, loans, with a lower risk weight of 130%. A significant difference between the Regulatory Relief Act and the agencies’ HVADC proposal arises from the Regulatory Relief Act’s preservation of the exemption for projects where the borrower has contributed at least 15% of the real property’s appraised “as completed” value.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s construction to total capital ratio was 143.4%, its total non-owner occupied commercial real estate (including construction) to total capital ratio was 339.5% and therefore exceeded the 100% and 300% regulatory guideline thresholds set forth in clauses (iii) and (iv) above. As a result, we are deemed to have a concentration in commercial real estate lending under applicable regulatory guidelines.
Prompt Corrective Action 
In addition to the required minimum capital levels described above, federal law establishes a system of “prompt corrective actions” that federal banking agencies are required to take, and certain actions that they have discretion to take, based upon the capital category into which a federally regulated depository institution falls. Regulations set forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution which is not adequately capitalized. Under the prompt corrective action rules, an institution is deemed “well capitalized” if its leverage ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 Capital ratio, and Total Capital ratio meet or exceed 5%, 6.5%, 8%, and 10%, respectively. An institution is deemed to be “adequately capitalized” or better if its leverage, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios meet or exceed the minimum federal regulatory capital requirements set forth in the Basel III Final Rule. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it fails to meet the minimum capital requirements. An institution is “significantly undercapitalized” if any one of its leverage, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios falls below 3%, 3%, 4%, and 6%, respectively, and “critically undercapitalized” if the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.
The Regulatory Relief Act requires the federal banking agencies to promulgate a rule establishing a new “Community Bank Leverage Ratio,” or CBLR, of 8% to 10% for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies, including banks and BHCs, with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company and the Bank. If such a depository institution or holding company maintains tangible equity in excess of this leverage ratio, it would be deemed in compliance with (1) the leverage and risk-based capital requirements promulgated by the federal banking agencies; (2) in the case of a depository institution, the capital ratio requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under the federal banking 

26

agencies’ “prompt corrective action” regime; and (3) any other capital or leverage requirements to which the depository institution or holding company is subject, in each case, unless the appropriate federal banking agency determines otherwise based on the particular institution’s risk profile. The Regulatory Relief Act defines the CBLR differently from the leverage ratio used in determining a bank’s prompt corrective action status.
The prompt corrective action rules require an undercapitalized institution to file a written capital restoration plan, along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party. In addition, an undercapitalized institution becomes subject to certain automatic restrictions, including a prohibition on payment of dividends and a limitation on asset growth and expansion in certain cases, a limitation on the payment of bonuses or raises to senior executive officers, and a prohibition on the payment of certain “management fees” to any “controlling person.” Institutions that are classified as undercapitalized are also subject to certain additional supervisory actions, including increased reporting burdens and regulatory monitoring; limitations on the institution’s ability to make acquisitions, open new branch offices or engage in new lines of business; obligations to raise additional capital; restrictions on transactions with affiliates; and restrictions on interest rates paid by the institution on deposits. In certain cases, banking regulatory agencies may require replacement of senior executive officers or directors, or sale of the institution to a willing purchaser. If an institution is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized” and continues in that category for 90 days, the statute requires, with certain narrowly limited exceptions, that the institution be placed in receivership.
An insured depository institution’s capital levels may have consequences outside the prompt corrective action regime. For example, only well-capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits without restrictions on rates, while adequately capitalized institutions must seek a waiver from the FDIC to accept such deposits and are subject to rate restrictions. Well-capitalized institutions may be eligible for expedited treatment of certain applications, an advantage not available to other institutions.
As noted above, Basel III integrates the new capital requirements into the prompt corrective action category definitions. The following capital requirements have applied to the Bank since January 1, 2015.

CapitalCategory | Total Risk-BasedCapital Ratio | Tier 1 Risk-BasedCapital Ratio | Common EquityTier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio | Leverage Ratio | Tangible Equityto Assets | SupplementalLeverage Ratio
Well Capitalized | 10% or greater | 8% or greater | 6.5% or greater | 5% or greater | n/a | n/a 
Adequately Capitalized | 8% or greater | 6% or greater | 4.5% or greater | 4% or greater | n/a | 3% or greater 
Undercapitalized | Less than 8% | Less than 6% | Less than 4.5% | Less than 4% | n/a | Less than 3% 
Significantly Undercapitalized | Less than 6% | Less than 4% | Less than 3% | Less than 3% | n/a | n/a 
Critically Undercapitalized | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | Less than 2% | n/a 

As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was well capitalized according to the guidelines generally discussed above. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a consolidated ratio of 14.2% of total capital to risk-weighted assets, a consolidated ratio of 13.0% of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, a consolidated ratio of 12.7% of common equity Tier 1 capital, and a leverage ratio of 10.8%, and the Bank had a ratio of 12.3% of total capital to risk-weighted assets, a ratio of 11.0% of common equity Tier 1 capital, a ratio of 11.0% of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and a leverage ratio of 9.1%.
Safety and Soundness Standards
The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, (ii) loan documentation, (iii) credit underwriting, (iv) asset growth, (v) earnings and (vi) compensation, fees and benefits.

27

In addition, the federal banking agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. These guidelines provide six standards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating. Under these standards, an insured depository institution should (i) conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets, (ii) estimate the inherent losses in problem assets and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses, (iii) compare problem asset totals to capital, (iv) take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets, (v) consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations and (vi) provide periodic asset quality reports with adequate information for management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk.
Community Reinvestment Act 
The CRA requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to assess all financial institutions that they regulate to determine whether these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the communities they serve, including their assessment area(s) (as established for these purposes in accordance with applicable regulations based principally on the location of branch offices). In addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be required for a violation of certain fair lending laws, the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and the CRA into account when regulating and supervising other activities and when reviewing applications for various purposes, including bank mergers and the establishment of new branch offices. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “unsatisfactory.” An institution’s record in meeting the requirements of the CRA is based on a performance-based evaluation system, and is made publicly available and is taken into consideration in connection with any applications it files with federal regulators to engage in certain activities, including approval of a branch or other deposit facility, mergers and acquisitions, office relocations, or expansions into non-banking activities. Our Bank received a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent CRA evaluation.
Anti-Terrorism, Money Laundering Legislation and OFAC
The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA Patriot Act. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and accounts and other relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. The principal requirements for an insured depository institution include (i) establishment of an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components, (ii) establishment of a “know your customer” program involving due diligence to confirm the identities of persons seeking to open accounts and to deny accounts to those persons unable to demonstrate their identities, (iii) the filing of currency transaction reports for deposits and withdrawals of large amounts of cash, (iv) additional precautions for accounts sought and managed for non-U.S. persons and (v) verification and certification of money laundering risk with respect to private banking and foreign correspondent banking relationships. For many of these tasks a bank must keep records to be made available to its primary federal regulator. Anti-money laundering rules and policies are developed by a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or the Treasury Department , the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, but compliance by individual institutions is overseen by its primary federal regulator.
The Bank has established appropriate anti-money laundering and customer identification programs. The Bank also maintains records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, files reports of certain cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and reports suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank otherwise has implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements.
The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various 

28

Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If the Company or the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, the Company or the Bank must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report, and notify the appropriate authorities.
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity
The GLBA and the implementing regulations issued by federal regulatory agencies require financial institutions (including banks, insurance agencies, and broker/dealers) to adopt policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about their customers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, financial institutions are required to explain to customers their policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, unless otherwise required or permitted by law, financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing such information except as provided in their policies and procedures. Specifically, the GLBA established certain information security guidelines that require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.
Recent cyber-attacks against banks and other financial institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information have prompted the federal banking regulators to issue extensive guidance on cybersecurity. Among other things, financial institutions are expected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes address the risks posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to authenticate customers accessing internet-based services. A financial institution also should have a robust business continuity program to recover from a cyberattack and procedures for monitoring the security of third-party service providers that may have access to nonpublic data at the institution.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, which is an independent bureau with broad authority to regulate the consumer finance industry, including regulated financial institutions, non-banks and others involved in extending credit to consumers. The CFPB has authority through rulemaking, orders, policy statements, guidance, and enforcement actions to administer and enforce federal consumer financial laws, to oversee several entities and market segments not previously under the supervision of a federal regulator, and to impose its own regulations and pursue enforcement actions when it determines that a practice is unfair, deceptive, or abusive. The federal consumer financial laws and all of the functions and responsibilities associated with them, many of which were previously enforced by other federal regulatory agencies, were transferred to the CFPB on July 21, 2011. While the CFPB has the power to interpret, administer, and enforce federal consumer financial laws, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the federal banking regulatory agencies continue to have examination and enforcement powers over the financial institutions that they supervise relating to the matters within the jurisdiction of the CFPB if such institutions have less than $10 billion in assets. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws. 
Mortgage Loan Origination 
The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing final rule adopted by the CFPB, or the ATR/QM Rule, which became effective on January 10, 2014, a financial institution may not make a residential mortgage loan to a consumer unless it 

29

first makes a “reasonable and good faith determination” that the consumer has a “reasonable ability” to repay the loan. In addition, the ATR/QM Rule limits prepayment penalties and permits borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a “qualified mortgage,” as defined by the CFPB. For this purpose, the ATR/QM Rule defines a “qualified mortgage” to include a loan with a borrower debt-to-income ratio of less than or equal to 43% or, alternatively, a loan eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while they operate under federal conservatorship or receivership, and loans eligible for insurance or guarantee by the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Administration or the United States Department of Agriculture. Additionally, a qualified mortgage may not (i) contain excess upfront points and fees, (ii) have a term greater than 30 years or (iii) include interest only or negative amortization payments. The ATR/QM Rule specifies the types of income and assets that may be considered in the ability-to-repay determination, the permissible sources for verification, and the required methods of calculating the loan’s monthly payments.
The Regulatory Relief Act provides that for certain insured depository institutions and insured credit unions with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, mortgage loans that are originated and retained in portfolio will automatically be deemed to satisfy the “ability to repay” requirement. In order to qualify, the insured depository institutions and credit unions must meet conditions relating to prepayment penalties, points and fees, negative amortization, interest-only features and documentation.
The Regulatory Relief Act directs federal banking agencies to issue regulations exempting certain insured depository institutions and insured credit unions with assets of $10 billion or less from the requirement to establish escrow accounts in connection with certain residential mortgage loans.
Insured depository institutions and insured credit unions that originated fewer than 500 closed-end mortgage loans or 500 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding years are exempt from a subset of disclosure requirements (recently imposed by the CFPB) under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA, provided they have received certain minimum CRA ratings in their most recent examinations.
The Regulatory Relief Act also directs the Comptroller of the Currency to conduct a study assessing the effect of the exemption described above on the amount of HMDA data available at the national and local level.
In addition, Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, to require sponsors of asset-backed securities, or ABS, to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the assets underlying the securities and generally prohibits sponsors from transferring or hedging that credit risk. In October 2014, the federal banking regulatory agencies adopted a final rule to implement this requirement, or the Risk Retention Rule. Among other things, the Risk Retention Rule requires a securitizer to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of any asset that the securitizer, through the issuance of an ABS, transfers, sells, or conveys to a third party; and prohibits a securitizer from directly or indirectly hedging or otherwise transferring the credit risk that the securitizer is required to retain. In certain situations, the final rule allows securitizers to allocate a portion of the risk retention requirement to the originator(s) of the securitized assets, if an originator contributes at least 20% of the assets in the securitization. The Risk Retention Rule also provides an exemption to the risk retention requirements for an ABS collateralized exclusively by Qualified Residential Mortgages, or QRMs, and ties the definition of a QRM to the definition of a “qualified mortgage” established by the CFPB for purposes of evaluating a consumer’s ability to repay a mortgage loan. The federal banking agencies have agreed to review the definition of QRMs in 2019, following the CFPB’s own review of its “qualified mortgage” regulation. For purposes of residential mortgage securitizations, the Risk Retention Rule took effect on December 24, 2015. For all other securitizations, the rule took effect on December 24, 2016. 
The Volcker Rule 
In December 2013, five federal financial regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, adopted final rules implementing the so-called “Volcker Rule” embodied in Section 13 of the BHC Act, which was 

30

added by the Dodd-Frank Act. In general, the Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (2) having certain ownership interests in, and relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds, or covered funds. The Volcker Rule is intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and the related exemptions and exclusions. 
The Regulatory Relief Act creates an exemption from prohibitions on propriety trading, and relationships with certain investment funds for banking entities with (i) less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, and (ii) trading assets and trading liabilities of less than 5% of its total consolidated assets. Currently, all banks are subject to these prohibitions pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. Any insured depository institution that is controlled by a company that itself exceeds these $10 billion and 5% thresholds would not qualify for the exemption. While the Company would be exempt from the prohibition on proprietary trading pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the Company currently does not have any ownership interest in, or relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds, or covered funds, or engage in any activities that would have previously subjected it to the Volcker Rule.
Other Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act 
The Dodd-Frank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape. In addition to the reforms previously mentioned, the Dodd-Frank Act also:

• | requires BHCs and banks to be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state and requires any BHC electing to be treated as a financial holding company to be both well managed and well capitalized;


• | eliminates all remaining restrictions on interstate banking by authorizing national and state banks to establish de novo branches in any state that would permit a bank chartered in that state to open a branch at that location; and


• | repeals Regulation Q, the federal prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.

A significant number of the rules and regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized. Given the uncertainty associated with both the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented and the changes required by the Regulatory Relief Act, the full impact of new regulations and guidance on financial institutions’ operations is unclear.
Federal Home Loan Bank Membership 
The Bank is a member of the FHLB. Each member of the FHLB is required to maintain a minimum investment in the Class B stock of the FHLB. The Board of Directors of the FHLB can increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Because the extent of any obligation to increase the level of investment in the FHLB depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, we are unable to determine the extent of future required potential payments to the FHLB at this time. Additionally, in the event that a member financial institution fails, the right of the FHLB to seek repayment of funds loaned to that institution will take priority (a super lien) over the rights of all other creditors.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017

31

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, was signed into law. The Tax Act includes a number of provisions that impact us, including the following:

• | Tax Rate. The Tax Act replaces the graduated corporate tax rates applicable under prior law, which imposed a maximum tax rate of 35%, with a reduced 21% flat tax rate. Although the reduced tax rate generally should be favorable to us by resulting in increased earnings and capital, it will decrease the value of our existing deferred tax assets. Generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires that the impact of the provisions of the Tax Act be accounted for in the period of enactment, which was 2017. As a result, we recorded net income tax expense of $1.4 million related to this revaluation. Of this amount, $40 thousand of expense was attributable to our net deferred tax asset for unrealized losses on available for sale securities and cash flow hedge. In addition to adjusting the deferred tax asset for this item, we recorded an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with a transfer to retained earnings. 


• | Employee Compensation. A “publicly held corporation” is not permitted to deduct compensation in excess of $1 million per year paid to certain employees. The Tax Act eliminates certain exceptions to the $1 million limit applicable under prior to law related to performance-based compensation, such as equity grants and cash bonuses that are paid only on the attainment of performance goals. 


• | Business Asset Expensing. The Tax Act allows taxpayers immediately to expense the entire cost (instead of only 50%, as under prior law) of certain depreciable tangible property and real property improvements acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023 (with an additional year for certain property). This 100% “bonus” depreciation is phased out proportionately for property placed in service on or after January 1, 2023 and before January 1, 2027 (with an additional year for certain property). 


• | Interest Expense. The Tax Act limits a taxpayer’s annual deduction of business interest expense to the sum of (i) business interest income and (ii) 30% of “adjusted taxable income,” defined as a business’s taxable income without taking into account business interest income or expense, net operating losses, and, for 2018 through 2021, depreciation, amortization and depletion. 

Other Laws and Regulations 
Our operations are subject to several additional laws, some of which are specific to banking and others of which are applicable to commercial operations generally. For example, with respect to our lending practices, we are subject to the following laws and regulations, among several others:

• | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;


• | HMDA, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibited factors in extending credit;


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies, certain identity theft protections, and certain credit and other disclosures;


• | Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;


32


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring certain disclosures concerning loan closing costs and escrows, and governing transfers of loan servicing and the amounts of escrows in connection with loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties;


• | Rules and regulations established by the National Flood Insurance Program; and


• | Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws.

Our deposit operations are subject to federal laws applicable to depository accounts, including:

• | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;


• | Truth-In-Savings Act, requiring certain disclosures for consumer deposit accounts;


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E of the Federal Reserve, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and


• | Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws.

We are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations that are not limited to banking organizations. For example, in lending to commercial and consumer borrowers, and in owning and operating our own property, we are subject to regulations and potential liabilities under state and federal environmental laws. In addition, we must comply with privacy and data security laws and regulations at both the federal and state level.
We are heavily regulated by regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. Like most of our competitors, we have faced and expect to continue to face increased regulation and regulatory and political scrutiny, which creates significant uncertainty for us, as well as for the financial services industry in general.
Enforcement Powers 
The federal regulatory agencies have substantial penalties available to use against depository institutions and certain “institution-affiliated parties.” Institution-affiliated parties primarily include management, employees, and agents of a financial institution, as well as independent contractors and consultants, such as attorneys, accountants, and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution’s affairs. An institution can be subject to an enforcement action due to the failure to timely file required reports, the filing of false or misleading information, or the submission of inaccurate reports, or engaging in other unsafe or unsound banking practices. Civil penalties may be as high as $1,924,589 per day for violations.
The Financial Institution Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act provided regulators with greater flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties and to terminate an institution’s deposit insurance. It also expanded the power of banking regulatory agencies to issue regulatory orders. Such orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate. The Dodd-Frank Act increases regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks, BHCs, and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency.
Future Legislation and Regulation 

33

Regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry in recent years, leading in many cases to greater uncertainty and compliance costs for regulated entities. Proposals that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry have been and may be expected to continue to be introduced in the United States Congress, in state legislatures, and by applicable regulatory authorities. These proposals may change banking statutes and regulations and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, these proposals could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that these proposals, or any implementing regulations, would have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Risk Factors —Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.”
