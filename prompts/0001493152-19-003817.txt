Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We were formed in April 2017 as a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative pharmaceutical products utilizing the FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Our business model is to develop proprietary innovative products that fulfill an unmet patient need. Since our formation, we have focused our efforts on the development of our initial product candidates, engaging in preliminary discussions with the FDA concerning the regulatory pathway for certain additional product candidates, registration filings of our initial product candidates and the licensing of late-stage product candidates.


We have established a diversified pipeline of product candidates in various stages of development. Our corporate strategy is to pursue what we perceive to be low-risk 505(b)(2) product candidates where existing published literature, historical clinical trials, or physician usage has established safety or efficacy of the molecule, thereby reducing the incremental clinical burden required for us to bring the product to patients. We intend to focus on product candidates that we believe will offer innovative and proprietary functional advantages to currently available alternatives, as well as product candidates that are currently unapproved.
 
We typically pursue product candidates that require a single small Phase 3 trial, a bio-equivalence trial, or literature-based filings. Prior to initiating significant development activities on a product candidate, we intend to meet with the FDA to establish a defined clinical and regulatory path to approval.
 
Market Opportunity
 
We believe there is a large market opportunity for developing drugs that offer improvements to currently approved treatments and address unmet patient needs. We pursue product opportunities where patient demand is not being met by current FDA-approved pharmaceutical products. This may include products that are being supplied on an unapproved basis, products that are currently being compounded, products that are approved and sold internationally but not available in the United States, or approved products where we believe we can provide a lower-cost alternative to an existing high-priced branded product. While we may opportunistically pursue 505(b)(2) opportunities across all dosage forms, we are primarily focused on liquid products, including injectables, oral liquids and ophthalmics.
 
505(b)(2) Pathway. The 505(b)(2) pathway is intended for molecules that have been previously approved by the FDA or have already been proven to be safe and effective. A 505(b)(2) product typically reformulates the known molecule in a new strength or dosage form. 505(b)(2) products have the advantage of potentially significantly lower development costs and shorter development timelines versus traditional new molecular entities. We expect to utilize the 505(b)(2) pathway for all of our current product candidates, except for EM-100, for which we are utilizing the 505(j) pathway.
 
A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. This alternate regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. A 505(b)(2) product candidate might rely on the clinical studies or literature of a previously FDA-approved drug, or rely on the literature and physician usage of an FDA-unapproved, or DESI, drug. The clinical requirements for a 505(b)(2) drug candidate can vary widely from product to product and may include new clinical trials, bioequivalence trials, limited safety and efficacy trials, or full Phase 1 through 3 trials. Unless the FDA has released a guidance document, the clinical requirement for a new product candidate is typically not known until the drug sponsor has a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA. We believe there is a significant opportunity to pursue liquid or other alternative formulations of off-patent drugs using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.

We are utilizing the 505(j) pathway for obtaining FDA approval for our EM-100 product candidate. The 505(j) pathway is used for product candidates that are therapeutically equivalent to an approved product and requires an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, which relies on the FDA’s finding that the previously approved drug candidate is safe and effective. An ANDA generally must contain information to show that the product candidate is the same as the approved product with respect to API, conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, strength and labeling, with certain permissible differences, and is the bioequivalent of the approved drug. The 505(j) pathway typically requires no clinical testing other than a bioequivalence trial. While the 505(j) pathway is typically shorter and less expensive than the 505(b)(2) pathway, the 505(b)(2) pathway allows greater flexibility as to the characteristics of the product candidate.
 
DESI Program. Upon its enactment in 1938, the FDCA required new drugs to demonstrate that they were safe before they could be marketed. In 1962, the FDCA was amended to require that new drugs demonstrate that they were effective as well as safe. Following the 1962 amendments to the FDCA, the FDA adopted a program called the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation, or DESI, to review the efficacy of drugs approved between 1938 and 1962, and the drugs approved between 1938 and 1962 are commonly referred to as DESI drugs. DESI drugs were allowed to remain on the market until they were re-reviewed as long as they weren’t substantially changed. The DESI program removed many products that were deemed to not be effective, but there was no comprehensive list of drugs approved and marketed at the time and not all drugs were re-reviewed. As a result, many DESI products remained marketed without a formal approval for effectiveness. Based on the FDA’s published guidance document, we would expect the currently marketed product to exit the market within one year of our product’s approval. We believe there is a significant opportunity to obtain FDA approval of unapproved DESI drugs.
 
Goals and Strengths
 
Our goal is to become a leading specialty pharmaceutical company through the introduction of innovative medicines that are affordable and available to all patients. We believe our competitive strengths include our:

● | unique knowledge of the industry, including our ability to identify product opportunities; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | management’s regulatory and development experience, particularly within the 505(b)(2) pathway; 
● | our portfolio of attractive assets that we believe will enable us to compete effectively in the market; 
● | management’s experience in business development, M&A, licensing activities and broad industry connections; 
● | differentiated business model as compared to generic and branded specialty pharmaceutical drug companies, utilizing the 505(b)(2) pathway; and 
● | patent rights, know-how, exclusive API and manufacturing relationships. 

Strategy
 
We intend to grow our business through opportunistic development and licensing of 505(b)(2) products. Our primary criteria for product candidates are:
 

● | Low regulatory risk: We focus on molecules where there is significant existing clinical data or literature to show that the product is safe and effective, creating a higher probability of clinical and regulatory success. Our product candidates do not typically require extensive clinical trials. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Low commercial risk: We select product candidates where patient demand is apparent, providing a high-degree of confidence in commercial success. We pursue products that are currently compounded, sold as unapproved products, or where we are providing a lower-cost alternative to high-price branded products with strong existing demand. Our candidates are typically well-known molecules that require minimal sales force promotion, so we able to pursue opportunities across various therapeutic areas.

● | Short development timelines: We believe that the product candidates internally developed by us typically have a path to approval of approximately 36 months from the time of product initiation. For product opportunities acquired or licensed by us, we primarily focus on opportunities where the NDA has been submitted, or is near submission, and the product candidate could be less than 18 months away from the commercial market. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Relatively low cost: We prefer to develop numerous lower-cost projects, rather than a single high-cost candidate. We do not believe that development costs are necessarily correlated with the earnings potential of products. 
● | Protection from competition. We endeavor to acquire rights to or internally develop products that may receive Orange-book listed patents or FDA-granted exclusivity. We have also entered into exclusive agreements with manufacturing partners and API suppliers on most of our products. 

 
We intend to aggressively pursue value-creating business development opportunities, including the licensing or acquisition of individual development-stage or commercial products, as well as the acquisition of companies or subsidiaries of operating companies. Our management team has a track record of successfully growing businesses through value-creating business development activities and has completed numerous transactions during their careers. At any particular time, we are typically evaluating multiple acquisition or licensing opportunities of various sizes. We believe management’s business development experience and broad industry contacts provide us with a competitive advantage.
 
Products
 
We have assembled a diversified pipeline of high-value drug candidates in various stages of development. Four of our products have been submitted to the FDA.
 
We source products both internally, by contracting with third-parties for development of our internal candidates on a fee-for-service basis, and externally, through the licensing or acquisition of existing development or commercial products. For products that we have licensed or acquired from third parties, we typically are required to pay a combination of licensing fees, milestone payments, and/or profit share/royalty payments to our partner.
 
We expect to continue growing our pipeline of product candidates through business development activities, and we are in active discussions with the FDA on additional products that may be added to our pipeline if we elect to proceed with the opportunity after the outcome of our pre-IND meeting with the FDA.
 
Innovative Formula Products
 
For our innovative formula products, we have developed improved versions of already FDA-approved products. We believe our unique formulas will provide a significant benefit to patients or practitioners, in the form of improved safety, efficacy, or more affordable costs. Our innovative formula products include:
 
EM-100. EM-100 is an ophthalmic solution indicated for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. EM-100 is a unique preservative-free formulation of ketotifen. Ketotifen is an FDA-approved molecule that is widely used and sold via the over-the-counter channel. Ketotifen is an antihistamine for the eye that treats allergic symptoms. It is also a mast cell stabilizer that minimizes allergic reactions by reducing the release of natural substances that cause an allergic reaction. Side effects associated with ketotifen use include eye dryness, headache, and runny nose. All currently FDA-approved ketotifen ophthalmic products contain the preservative benzalkonium chloride, which has been shown to cause irritation and negatively impact long-term eye health. We believe our unique preservative-free formulation will successfully treat allergic conjunctivitis and, at the same time, provide an increased comfort profile to patients.

-


As of the date of this Annual Report, there are no FDA approved preservative-free ophthalmic products available for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. We are not aware of any other companies working on preservative-free versions of ketotifen, or any other allergic conjunctivitis treatment, so we expect EM-100 to be the first preservative-free product in its class.
 
Our development partner previously submitted an ANDA for EM-100 and in response to a complete response letter, or CRL, from the FDA we ran a bioequivalence trial in April 2018. The 65-patient clinical trial successfully showed statistically significant non-inferiority to ZADITOR (ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.035%) and statistically significant superiority to the placebo with no adverse events reported. We responded to the CRL in September 2018. We are utilizing the 505(j) pathway for FDA approval of EM-100. The 505(j) pathway is typically utilized for generic drug candidates. We do not anticipate utilizing the 505(j) pathway for any other of our current product candidates.
 
On February 18, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Bausch Health Ireland Limited (“Bausch”) for Bausch to sell EM-100 in the United States, including any such product that incorporates or utilizes our intellectual property rights with respect to EM-100.
 
ET-202. In February 2019 we acquired rights to ET-202. ET-202 is an injectable product candidate to be used in the hospital setting. ET-202 is an innovative ready-to-use formula of an existing injectable product that we believe to be one of the highest volume compounded products in the hospital setting. The existing FDA-approved product is only available in a concentrated strength that must be diluted prior to administration to patients. Hospitals currently purchase non-FDA approved ready-to-use products from compounding facilities, or manually dilute the products in-house. Our product candidate has been developed in a ready-to-use strength that can be immediately administered in patients, eliminating the need for additional dilution steps. We believe that if approved, ET-202 will offer significant benefits to hospitals over the current compounded products, including: longer shelf-life, elimination of compounding errors, greater sterility assurance, and more consistent supply. Our product development partner submitted an NDA for ET-202 in December 2018. The NDA has been accepted for review by the FDA, and was assigned a PDUFA target action date in October 2019.
 
ET-103. ET-103 is a unique oral liquid formulation of levothyroxine for the treatment of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid or low thyroid, is a disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. Levothyroxine is a synthetic form of thyroxine, an endogenous hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, which is converted to its active metabolite, L-triiodothyronine. Thyroxine and L-triiodothyronine bind to thyroid receptor proteins in the cell nucleus and cause metabolic effects through the control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis.
 
Currently, levothyroxine is delivered primarily in tablet and capsule form. Levothyroxine is one of the most frequently prescribed medications in the United States with sales of greater than $2.6 billion and more than 5.7 billion tablets and capsules sold annually. It is estimated that 15% of Americans over the age of 55 take levothyroxine daily. Side effects reported with oral use of levothyroxine include fatigue, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever and excessive sweating. We believe ET-103 will offer a significant benefit to the subset of levothyroxine patients that have challenges swallowing or need more flexible dosing. As a result, we expect ET-103 to capture a small percentage of the overall levothyroxine tablet and capsule market.
 
We plan to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA application referencing Synthroid®, the leading levothyroxine product in the market. We held a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA in September 2018, and the agency agreed with our proposal to conduct a bridging study between ET-103 and Synthroid as the principal means of proving safety and efficacy. We have initiated the study and, if successful, plan to submit an NDA in 2019.
 
ET-203. In February 2019 we signed a licensing agreement for ET-203. ET-203 is an injectable product candidate to be used in the hospital setting. ET-203 is an innovative ready-to-use formula of an existing injectable product that we believe to be one of the highest volume compounded products in the hospital setting. The existing FDA-approved product is only available in concentrated strengths that must be diluted prior to administration to patients. Hospitals currently purchase non-FDA approved ready-to-use products from compounding facilities, or manually dilute the products in-house. Our product candidate has been developed in a ready-to-use strength that can be immediately administered in patients, eliminating the need for additional dilution steps. We believe that if approved, ET-203 will offer significant benefits to hospitals over the current compounded products, including: longer shelf-life, elimination of compounding errors, greater sterility assurance, and more consistent supply. An NDA for ET-203 is expected to be submitted in 2019.

ET-104. In January 2019 we signed a licensing agreement for ET-104, an innovative oral liquid product candidate targeting a neurological indication. ET-104’s active ingredient is approved and marketed in an oral solid formulation, but the active ingredient is not approved by the FDA in liquid form. Currently, patients requiring liquid formulations of the active ingredient are reliant on compounded products. ET-104 is expected to address this significant unmet patient need. Our development partner filed a patent application on its unique formula in March 2019. We and our development partner expect to complete a bioequivalence trial and, if successful, expect to submit an NDA with the FDA by the end of 2019.
 
ET-101. ET-101 is an innovative oral liquid product for a neurological indication. The active ingredient in ET-101 is FDA-approved in an oral solid dosage form and there are several approved products in the market in oral solid dosage form. ET-101 is not approved in oral liquid form. The exact mechanism of action of the active ingredient is unknown. Based on a pre-IND meeting with the FDA, we expect to conduct a bioequivalence trial for ET-101 as the principal means of proving safety and efficacy. We anticipate submitting a patent application on our unique formulation and expect to submit an NDA for ET-101 in 2020.
 
ET-102. ET-102 is an innovative oral liquid product for a neurological indication. The active ingredient in ET-102 is FDA-approved in an oral solid dosage form, but not approved in an oral liquid form. The precise mechanism of action of ET-102 is not fully known but it is believed to be capable of inhibiting both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level. Based on a pre-IND meeting with the FDA, we expect to conduct a bioequivalence trial for ET-102 as the principal means of proving safety and efficacy. We expect to submit an NDA for ET-102 in 2020.
 
CT-100. CT-100 is our patent-pending synthetic corticotropin therapeutic candidate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Our CT-100 product candidate mimics the amino acid chain of H.P. Acthar Gel. Our patent-pending technology stabilizes a known unstable molecule of the approved drug. It is well documented that natural corticotropin is an unstable molecule and that its instability leads to reduced potency over time or at higher temperatures. We believe that our synthetic corticotropin is stable and retains its potency far longer that H.P. Acthar Gel. Our synthetic corticotropin is a 39-chain amino acid peptide synthetic adrenocorticotrophic hormone, non-gelatin and preservative-free. CT-100 is an injectable product candidate that could be administered in both the hospital and home settings.
 
We have held two written response meetings with the FDA regarding CT-100 and we are currently working with a clinical research organization (“CRO”) to analyze the cost and protocol for CT-100’s clinical program based on the FDA’s feedback. Due to the long projected development timeline and significant clinical cost required to bring CT-100, we believe CT-100 does not fit our current business strategy. We plan to out-license the product to a company that can advance the product’s development, allowing us to retain economic exposure to CT-100’s potential commercial sales without requiring any additional investment in this product candidate’s development.
 
DESI Conversion Products
 
Our portfolio also includes DESI conversion product candidates for which we are seeking formal FDA approval for molecules where the U.S market is currently relying on a DESI product. We will seek to convert the market from the current DESI products to our formally approved products. DESI products, also known as “grandfathered” or “unapproved” products, are products that were marketed prior to 1962 when the FDA began requiring proof of efficacy, in addition to safety, in order to gain approval. The FDA has allowed DESI products to remain on the market until someone receives formal FDA approval for the molecule. We will pursue a formal approval via the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway for our products. Based on the FDA’s published guidance document, we would expect the currently marketed unapproved product to exit the market within one year of our product’s approval.

Currently, the combined IQVIA sales of the DESI products we are referencing is greater than $40 million. With more consistent supply and promotion of our product candidates, we believe our market opportunity is larger than the historic sales levels. Our DESI conversion products include:
 
DS-300. DS-300 is an injectable product intended for use as an additive to meet the nutritional requirements of neonates requiring total parenteral nutrition. The product is administered in the hospital setting to patients that are unable to naturally produce sufficient levels of needed nutrients. DS-300’s active ingredient is naturally occurring in the body and has been administered to patients as a supplement for decades with no reports of any meaningful adverse events besides occasional infusion site reactions.
 
Based on a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA, DS-300’s NDA was submitted as a literature-based filing as the principal means of proving safety and efficacy. The NDA references 24 studies published in well-respected medical publications, tracking more than 700 patients. The product’s NDA was filed with the FDA in January 2018. DS-300 has been granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA and is being reviewed by the FDA as a Rolling Review, meaning we are allowed to submit sections of our NDA as they are completed rather than waiting for completion of the entire NDA. All sections of the NDA have been submitted. However, the original manufacturing site is no longer available, so the product is being transferred to a different FDA-approved manufacturing site. We are not aware of any drug companies that have publicly disclosed their development of a product based on DS-300’s active ingredient.
 
DS-200. DS-200 is an injectable nutrition product indicated for use as a supplement to intravenous solutions for total parenteral nutrition. The product is administered in the hospital setting to patients that are unable to naturally produce sufficient levels of needed nutrients and minerals. DS-200’s active ingredient is naturally occurring in the body and has been administered to patients as a supplement for decades with no reports of any meaningful adverse events besides occasional infusion site reactions.
 
Based on a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA, DS-200 was submitted as a literature-based filing as the principal means of proving safety and efficacy. We referenced more than 15 published articles which showed safety and efficacy in studies involving more than 2,000 patients. DS-200 has been granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA, which we believe highlights the unmet need our product is aiming to address. DS-200’s NDA was submitted in March 2019 as a Rolling Review. We are not aware of any drug companies that have publicly disclosed their development of a product based on DS-200’s active ingredient.
 
DS-100. DS-100 is an injectable nerve block indicated for therapeutic neurolysis for the relief of intractable pain, generally defined as severe, constant pain that is not curable by any known means. We are currently in discussions with the FDA regarding the exact indication we will pursue and clinical requirements for DS-100, however as of the date of this Annual Report it is our intention to seek FDA approval of DS-100 for the indication as a general nerve block. We expect either a literature-based filing or a small clinical trial as the principal means of proving safety and efficacy. We believe the existing literature shows safety and efficacy in 10 published studies involving more than 850 patients. Reported side effects included mild hypotension, diarrhea, and nausea. We expect an NDA for DS-100 to be submitted in 2020. An injectable version of DS-100’s active ingredient was previously FDA-approved for a different indication.
 
At any time, we typically have various products and product ideas in early-stage development. These may include products where we have not yet met with the FDA, or products for which we have met with the FDA and received agreement upon our clinical pathway, but we have yet to complete significant development activities.
 
Research and Development
 
Set forth below is our R&D spending for our current product candidates. We currently have nine employees that support our overall product development and we also have facility and operating costs for a laboratory that will support product development. We do not track internal costs by product for our employees and laboratory expenses and they are listed as indirect expenses in the table below (amounts are in thousands).

Sales and Marketing
 
We intend to market prescription products ourselves under our own label and we have initiated the process of establishing our internal sales infrastructure. We are in the process of registering for licenses to distribute pharmaceuticals in all required states and territories of the United States. We anticipate being fully registered with all states in advance of launching our initial product under our own label. We have engaged an experienced third-party logistics company specializing in pharmaceuticals to manage inventory, logistics, and sales reconciliation for our commercial products. We may selectively out-license or seek a marketing partner on a product by product basis for products where we find it financially or strategically advantageous.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
We rely on third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture our products. All our manufacturing partners are based in the United States or Europe. We seek to work with CMOs that have a long history of quality and FDA compliance. All products are manufactured in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Processes (“cGMP”), and our internal quality system requires us to enter quality agreements with and audit all of our manufacturers prior to commercializing product. Our choice to rely on external manufacturers significantly reduces the amount of capital invested in our business and allows us the flexibility to pursue a broad range of opportunities beyond the specific capabilities of a single facility.
Licensing Arrangements
 
We source certain products externally through the licensing or acquisition of existing development or commercial products. Among our current pipeline of product candidates, we have entered into licensing and profit-sharing arrangements for many of our product candidates, including:
 
EM-100. We acquired the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and sell the EM-100 product in the United States pursuant to a Sales and Marketing Agreement dated August 11, 2017 between us and Eyemax LLC (“Eyemax”), an entity affiliated with our Chief Executive Officer (the “Sales Agreement”). On February 18, 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement (the “Amended Agreement”) with Eyemax amending the Sales Agreement. Pursuant to the Amended Agreement, Eyemax sold us all of its right, title and interest in EM-100, including any such product that incorporates or utilizes Eyemax’s intellectual property rights. Pursuant to the Amended Agreement, we remain obligated to pay Eyemax two milestones: (i) one milestone payment for $250,000 upon regulatory approval in the territory by the FDA of the first single agent product and (ii) one milestone payment for $500,000 following the first commercial sale of the first single agent product in the territory. Following payment of the milestones, we are entitled to retain all of the non-royalty transaction revenues and royalties up to $2,000,000 (the “Recovery Amount”). After we have retained the full Recovery Amount, we are entitled to retain half of all royalty and non-royalty transaction revenue.

On February 18, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Bausch. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, we sold all of our right, title and interest in EM-100 in the United States, including any such product that incorporates or utilizes our intellectual property rights with respect to EM-100. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bausch paid us an upfront payment of $500,000 and Bausch is required to pay us commercial milestone payments of up to $2,500,000. Bausch is required to pay us a royalty in the low-double digit percentage range on net sales for a period of 10 years from the date of the first commercial sale of the first single agent EM-100 product in the United States. In the event that any product with the same sole active ingredient as EM-100 is launched in the United States by any person other than Bausch (or its affiliates) during the term of Bausch’s royalty commitment, then the royalty rate will be reduced to a lower specified percentage. In the event that EM-100’s market share in the territory falls below a certain percentage of the target market during the term of Bausch’s royalty commitment, then the royalty rate will be further reduced to a lower specified percentage.
 
ET-103. We acquired the exclusive license to develop, manufacture and sell ET-103 in the United States pursuant to an Exclusive License and Supply Agreement dated August 3, 2018 between us and Liqmeds Worldwide Limited, an unaffiliated entity. Pursuant to the agreement, we will be responsible for, and shall own, all regulatory filings and approvals at our expense, provided that we shall have the right to recoup 35% of any regulatory filing fees from the initial profits from the sale of ET-103 and, provided further, the licensor shall be responsible for any bioequivalence study and shall be responsible for 60% of the costs of such study. An affiliate of the licensor shall manufacture the ET-103 and sell it to us at its cost. We paid the licensor $350,000 upon execution of the agreement and will pay the licensor $1,500,000 upon the FDA’s acceptance of an NDA for review, $1,000,000 upon FDA approval, $1,500,000 upon issuance of patent covering ET-103 listed in the FDA’s Orange Book and $500,000 in the event of product sales in excess of $10,000,000 in any calendar year. In addition, we are required to pay the licensor 35% of the net profit from product sales. The license agreement is for an initial term of ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product, subject to two-year renewals unless either party elects to terminate no less than 12 months prior to the then current term.
 
CT-100. We acquired from Harrow Health, Inc. (“Harrow”, fka Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) all of its rights to the CT-100 product and all related intellectual property and know-how and trade secrets specific to the product pursuant to an Asset Purchase and License Agreement dated May 9, 2017. Pursuant to the agreement, we also obtained from Harrow a non-exclusive license to certain know-how and trade secrets related, but not specific, to the CT-100 product. In addition, we licensed back to Harrow a non-exclusive, perpetual, non-transferable and royalty free license to use, manufacture and sell any product incorporating the intellectual property acquired from Harrow, other than products incorporating the synthetic corticotropin. The agreement requires us to pay Harrow a $50,000 milestone fee upon our initial patent issuance for the product and a six percent royalty fee on net sales of the product distributed and marketed by us or our licensees at such times as the product is covered by an issued patent, and a three percent royalty at all other times. The agreement also contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities by the parties.
 
DS-300. We acquired the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and sell the DS-300 product in the United States pursuant to a Sales and Marketing Agreement dated November 17, 2017, as amended on August 29, 2018, with an unaffiliated third party. Pursuant to the agreement, the licensor is responsible for obtaining FDA approval, at its expense, and we are responsible for commercializing the product in the United States, at our expense. We are entitled to 100% of the first $500,000 of net profit from the sale of the DS-300, generally defined as gross profit less certain fees and costs incurred by us, and will pay the licensor 100% of the next $1 million of net profit. Thereafter, we will pay 50% of the net profit to the licensor and its designees for the term of the agreement. The agreement has a term of ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of the DS-300, subject to one five-year extension at our option.

Intellectual Property
 
Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on our trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We vigorously defend our intellectual property to preserve our rights and gain the benefit of our technological investments. Our business is not dependent, however, upon any single patent, trademark or contract.
 
We own one patent application related to our CT-100 (Synthetic Corticotropin) product candidate. The patent application was submitted on June 13, 2017 and relates to a drug to treat multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diseases, and rheumatic disorders including infantile spasms, Addison’s disease, Nelson’s, Cushing’s and West syndromes. If granted, this application would have an approximate expiration of May 2037, in all jurisdictions where the cases are pending. The claimed subject matter in the patent application includes claims to compositions themselves and treatment methods using known compounds and formulations and dosage types.

Our development partner has filed a patent application for ET-104. We intend to seek patent protection on our internally developed products as circumstances warrant.
 
We have applied for trademark registration of the marks “Eton” and “Eton Pharmaceuticals” with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 
Government Regulations and Funding
 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by foreign, federal, state and local agencies, such as the FDA, and various European regulatory authorities. The manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to government regulation in the United States and various foreign countries. Additionally, in the United States, we must follow rules and regulations established by the FDA requiring the presentation of data indicating that our products are safe and efficacious and are manufactured in accordance with cGMP regulations. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products, and we may be criminally prosecuted. We, our manufacturers and CROs may also be subject to regulations under other foreign, federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act and import, export and customs regulations as well as the laws and regulations of other countries. The U.S. government has increased its enforcement activity regarding illegal marketing practices domestically and internationally. As a result, pharmaceutical companies must ensure their compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act.
 
These regulatory requirements impact our operations and differ from one country to another, so that securing the applicable regulatory approvals of one country does not imply the approval of another country. The approval procedures involve high costs and are manpower intensive, usually extend over many years and require highly skilled and professional resources.
 
FDA Market Approval Process
 
The steps usually required to be taken before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally include:
 

● | completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | completion of required chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing; 
● | the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, the application for which must be evaluated and found acceptable by the FDA before human clinical trials may commence; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
● | submission and approval of an NDA; and 
● | agreement with FDA of the language on the package insert. 

 
Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, what types of patients may enter the study, schedules of tests and procedures, drugs, dosages, and length of study, as well as the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND process.
 
Clinical trials are usually conducted in three phases. Phase 1 clinical trials are normally conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers to assess safety of various dosing regimens and pharmacokinetics. After a safe dose has been established, in Phase 2 clinical trials the drug is administered to small populations of sick patients to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease or condition and to continue to assess safety. Phase 3 clinical trials are usually multi-center, double-blind controlled trials in larger numbers of subjects at various sites to assess as fully as possible both the safety and effectiveness of the drug.
 

12
--


Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practices, or GCP, requirements. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical study at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. An institutional review board, or IRB, generally must approve the clinical trial design and patient informed consent at study sites that the IRB oversees and also may halt a study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group recommends whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical study sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 
As a product candidate moves through the clinical testing phases, manufacturing processes are further defined, refined, controlled and validated. The level of control and validation required by the FDA increases as clinical studies progress. We and the third-party manufacturers on which we rely for the manufacture of our product candidates and their respective components (including the API) are subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with cGMP. To comply with cGMP requirements, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to meet requirements relating to personnel, facilities, equipment, production and process, labeling and packaging, quality control, recordkeeping and other requirements.
 
Assuming completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information on the product candidate is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications, together with payment of a user fee, unless waived. An NDA includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 
If an NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA’s goal is to complete its initial review and respond to the applicant within ten months of submission, unless the application relates to an unmet medical need, or is for a serious or life-threatening indication, in which case the goal may be within six months of NDA submission. However, the review process and the target response date under PDUFA may be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the NDA. During its review of an NDA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. Data from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA and/or any advisory committee it appoints may interpret data differently than the applicant.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and inspects manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it will either approve commercial marketing of the drug product with prescribing information for specific indications or issue a complete response letter indicating that the application is not ready for approval and stating the conditions that must be met in order to secure approval of the NDA. If the complete response letter requires additional data and the applicant subsequently submits that data, the FDA nevertheless may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing. Such post-marketing testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and efficacy after approval.

If the FDA approves one of our product candidates, we will be required to comply with a number of post-approval regulatory requirements. We would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. If we seek to make certain changes to an approved product, such as certain manufacturing changes, we will need FDA review and approval before the change can be implemented. For example, if we change the manufacturer of a product or our API, the FDA may require stability or other data from the new manufacturer, and such data will take time and are costly to generate, and the delay associated with generating these data may cause interruptions in our ability to meet commercial demand, if any. While physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved. Securing FDA approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the original indication and requires, among other things, submitting data from adequate and well-controlled studies that demonstrate the product’s safety and efficacy in the new indication. Even if such studies are conducted, the FDA may not approve any change in a timely fashion, or at all.
 
The FDA may also require post-marketing testing, or Phase 4 testing, as well as risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions or an approval that could otherwise restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 
We intend to submit applications for product candidates via the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. As an alternate path for FDA approval of new indications or new formulations of previously-approved products, a company may submit a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, instead of a “stand-alone” or “full” NDA. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs that have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product or the FDA’s conclusions from prior review of such studies. The FDA may require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the labeled indications for which the reference product has been approved, as well as for any new indication supported by the Section 505(b)(2) application. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not generated by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new product must be included in an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2).
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product has expired. If the Orange Book certifications outlined above are not accomplished, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its products may be commercialized.

Section 505(j) Abbreviated New Drug Applications
 
The 505(j) pathway is used for product candidates that are therapeutically equivalent to an approved product. The underlying premise of the 505(j) pathway is that a product candidate classified as therapeutically equivalent can be substituted for the approved product with the full expectation that the substituted product will produce the same clinical effect and safety profile as the approved product when administered under the same conditions. A product candidate utilizing the 505(j) pathway requires an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, which relies on the FDA’s finding that the previously approved drug candidate is safe and effective. An ANDA generally must contain information to show that the product candidate is the same as the approved product with respect to API, conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, strength and labeling, with certain permissible differences, and is the bioequivalent of the approved drug. The 505(j) pathway typically requires no clinical testing other than a bioequivalence trial. While the 505(j) pathway is typically shorter and less expensive than the 505(b)(2) pathway, the 505(b)(2) pathway allows greater flexibility as to the characteristics of the product candidate.
 
DESI Program
 
Upon its enactment in 1938, the FDCA required new drugs to demonstrate that they were safe before they could be marketed. In 1962, the FDCA was amended to require that new drugs demonstrate that they were effective as well as safe. Following the 1962 amendments to the FDCA, the FDA adopted a program called the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation, or DESI, to review the efficacy of drugs approved between 1938 and 1962, and the drugs approved between 1938 and 1962 are commonly referred to as DESI drugs. DESI drugs were allowed to remain on the market until they were re-reviewed as long as they weren’t substantially changed. The DESI program removed many products that were deemed to not be effective, but there was no comprehensive list of drugs approved and marketed at the time and not all drugs were re-reviewed. As a result, many DESI products remained marketed without a formal approval for effectiveness.
 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
For products distributed in the United States, we will also be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:

● | The U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, lease, or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the U.S. False Claims Act, can be enforced by individuals, on behalf of the government, through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and the civil monetary penalties law, prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
● | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services; 
● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 


15
--


● | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives; and state and foreign laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal or state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 
Reimbursement
 
Sales of our products in the United States may depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, (the “MMA”), imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.

Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce physician usage of the products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the health care system that could prevent or delay marketing approval pharmaceutical products, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidates. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products.
 
For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Law”) was enacted, which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Health Care Reform Law, among other things, imposed reporting requirements on manufacturers related to drug samples and financial relationships with physicians and teaching hospitals, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and established a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program.
 
Some of the provisions of the Health Care Reform Law have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Health Care Reform Law. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Health Care Reform Law. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Health Care Reform Law have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Health Care Reform Law on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Health Care Reform Law-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the Health Care Reform, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Health Care Reform is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform will impact the Health Care Reform Law.
 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. These changes include, among others, aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year and an increase in the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some of these and other proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.
 
Moreover, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law. The 21st Century Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and biologics and spur innovation, but it has not yet been fully implemented and its ultimate implementation is unclear. Additionally, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of executive orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA’s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance and review and approval of marketing applications.
