BUSINESS
 Our Company
 We are a leading operator of business-to-business trade shows in the United States. We currently operate more than 55 trade shows, as well as numerous other face-to-face events. In 2018, Emerald’s events connected over 500,000 global attendees and exhibitors and occupied more than 7.0 million net square feet (“NSF”) of exhibition space.  We have been recognized with many awards and accolades that reflect our industry leadership as well as the importance of our shows to the exhibitors and attendees we serve. 
 All of our trade show franchises typically hold market-leading positions within their respective industry verticals, with significant brand value established over a long period of time. Each of our trade shows is held at least annually, with certain franchises offering multiple trade shows per year. As our shows are frequently the largest and most well attended in their respective industry verticals, we are able to attract high-quality attendees, including those who have the authority to make purchasing decisions on the spot or subsequent to the show. The participation of these attendees makes our trade shows “must-attend” events for our exhibitors, further reinforcing the leading positions of our trade shows within their respective industry verticals. Our attendees use our shows to fulfill procurement needs, source new suppliers, reconnect with existing suppliers, identify trends, learn about new products and network with industry peers, which we believe are factors that make our shows difficult to replace with non-face-to-face events. Our portfolio of trade shows is well-balanced and diversified across both industry sectors and customers. The scale and “must-attend” nature of our trade shows translates into an exceptional value proposition for participants, resulting in a self-reinforcing “network effect” whereby the participation of high-value attendees and exhibitors drives high participant loyalty and predictable, recurring revenue streams.
 Our History 
 In June 2013, Onex Corp. (“Onex”) acquired our business from an affiliate of Nielsen Holdings N.V. (the “Onex Acquisition”). We have since focused on expanding our portfolio of leading events organically, complemented by an increased focus on acquisitions. Since the Onex Acquisition, we have acquired 17 industry-leading, high-quality events of various sizes for aggregate consideration of approximately $663 million.
 In January 2014, we acquired George Little Management (“GLM”) for $335 million. At the time, GLM operated more than 20 trade shows, including four of the largest 100 trade shows in the United States. GLM significantly expanded our presence within a number of industry sectors, including Gift, Home & General Merchandise and Sports, and added new sectors such as Technology. 
 In 2015, we completed four acquisitions. In February, we acquired the Healthcare Media division of Vendome Group, which included leading events such as the Healthcare Design Conference and Expo, Healthcare Design Magazine, Environments for Aging and Construction SuperConference (collectively, “HCD Group”). In March, we acquired the International Pizza Expo (“Pizza Expo” and together with the trade magazine Pizza Today, “Pizza Group”), the largest trade show for independent pizzerias in the world. In October, we acquired HOW Design Live Conference (“HOW”), one of the largest graphic design conferences and expos in the nation. In November, we acquired the National Industrial Fastener and Mill Supply Expo (“Fastener Expo,” together with HCD Group, Pizza Group and HOW, the “2015 Acquisitions”), North America’s largest industrial fastener trade show.

Also in August, we acquired the Swim Collective and Active Collective trade shows (“Collective”), which include the first trade show focused entirely on activewear and the leading swimwear trade show on the West Coast. In October, we acquired the Digital Dealer Conference and Expo (“Digital Dealer”), the leading trade show series focused on the retail automotive industry’s digital strategy and operations. Also in October, we acquired the National Pavement Expo (“Pavement”), adding to our portfolio the largest U.S. trade show focused on paving and pavement maintenance. In November, we acquired RFID Journal LIVE! (“RFID LIVE!”), the largest trade show focused on radio frequency identification technologies used to identify, track, and manage corporate assets and inventory across a wide range of industries. In December, we acquired American Craft Retailers Expo (“ACRE,” together with IGES, Collective, Digital Dealer, Pavement and RFID LIVE!, the “2016 Acquisitions”), a wholesale craft exposition consisting of two shows.
 In 2017, we completed four acquisitions. In January, we acquired CEDIA Expo (“CEDIA”), the largest trade show in the home technology market. In March, we acquired the International Drone Conference & Exposition (“InterDrone”), the leading trade show in the U.S. commercial drone market. In May, we acquired the SnowSports Industries America Snow Show (“Snow Show”), which at the time of its acquisition was the largest snow sports industry event in North America.  In November, we acquired Connecting Point Marketing Group (“CPMG,” together with CEDIA, InterDrone and Snow Show, the “2017 Acquisitions”), a producer of best in class hosted-buyer model trade events focused on innovation for the hospitality, restaurant, healthcare, grocery and retail industries.
 On May 3, 2017, we completed our IPO of 17,825,000 shares of our common stock. We sold 10,333,333 shares, resulting in net proceeds to us after underwriting discounts and expenses of $159.1 million, and funds managed by Onex sold 7,491,667 shares from which we did not receive any proceeds. We used all of the net proceeds from the offering plus cash on hand, to prepay $159.2 million of borrowings outstanding under our Term Loan Facility (as defined herein).

Products and Services
 We operate leading trade shows in multiple attractive, fragmented industry sectors that represent significant portions of the U.S. economy and serve a large and diverse set of global exhibitors and attendees. This fragmentation of exhibitors and attendees is an especially important characteristic of the trade show industry. In markets characterized by diverse groups of buyers and sellers, trade shows offer a great opportunity for interaction between large numbers of participants on both sides of a potential transaction (a “many-to-many” environment) within a short period of time, thus enhancing the value delivered to all trade show participants. Further, the highly fragmented nature of our markets enhances the stability of our entire platform as the loss of any single exhibitor or attendee is unlikely to cause other exhibitors or attendees to derive less value from and cease participating in a show.
 We generated 93% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 through the live events that we operate. The remaining 7% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was generated from other marketing services, including digital media and print publications that complement our event properties in the industry sectors we serve. Each of our other marketing services products allows us to remain in close contact with, and market to, our existing event audiences throughout the year.

Trade Shows & Other Events
 The following is a summary of our trade shows by sector and a discussion of our complementary products.
 Gift, Home & General Merchandise
 We currently operate 10 trade shows in the Gift, Home & General Merchandise sector focused on a broad range of consumer goods used in and around the home. Our events are primarily order-writing shows where exhibitors, whose product assortment is always evolving, generate sales during the shows themselves. The base of exhibitors and attendees across these trade shows is highly fragmented, which mitigates the importance of any single exhibitor.
 
ASD Market Week (“ASD”) — Held in Las Vegas twice annually, ASD is the largest and most comprehensive value-oriented general merchandise trade show in the industry. Each ASD trade show features nine shows in a single location and covers the following categories: gift and home accents; jewelry and cash & carry; general store merchandise and closeouts; fashion and accessories; beauty and wellness products; toys and novelty products; convenience store and point-of-purchase products; cultural products; and Source Direct which allows buyers to purchase products directly from exhibitors including small importers, wholesalers, manufacturers, and distributors of low- to mid-priced goods.

Attendees include domestic and international chains and department stores, specialty retail stores, gift stores, online retailers, museums, designers, distributors, importers, and wholesalers from over 90 countries. Given the size and scope of the show, NY NOW enables attendees to source a wide variety of products for their stores in a single location in a short period of time. As with ASD, NY NOW is primarily an order-writing show with sales executed on the show floor.
Kitchen & Bath Industry Show (“KBIS”) — KBIS is one of the largest kitchen and bath design trade shows specifically serving residential kitchen and bath dealers, designers, architects, remodelers, wholesalers and custom builders who consider KBIS to be a “must-attend” event.

Sports
 We currently operate 17 trade shows within the Sports industry sector focused on sporting goods and related apparel and accessories for various active outdoor pursuits ranging from camping, hiking, climbing, skiing, bicycling and paddle sports. We believe that several of our trade shows in this sector have iconic status in the markets they serve, and offer a many-to-many environment where, for example, thousands of specialty sports retailers from across the country interact with hundreds of specialty equipment and apparel manufacturers. The Sports sector is highly fragmented where the sports enthusiast clientele is well-served by independent specialized retailers.
Outdoor Retailer (“OR”) — Held three times annually, OR is the largest outdoor sports and lifestyle trade show brand in the United States. Partnering with Outdoor Industry of America and Snowsports Industries America, OR has earned loyalty from high-end specialty brands and has solidified itself as a destination event for specialty retailers selling to outdoor enthusiasts. OR is organized across categories such as accessories, footwear, hard goods, apparel, and gear serving lifestyle sports such as camping, climbing, hiking, paddle sports, back-country and cross-country skiing, snowboarding and snow shoeing. Exhibitors include manufacturers, suppliers, importers, and licensees and distributors of sports gear from 30 countries. Attendees include independent, chain, and online retailers of active lifestyle sporting goods and media and licensing agents from 55 countries; however, the focus is on independent, high-end, specialty outdoor retailers, whose enthusiast clientele is not served by the mass-market products sold through major retail channels.
Surf Expo — Held twice annually in Orlando, Florida, Surf Expo is the largest and longest-running trade show in the world for action water and board sports as well as resort-oriented merchandise that one would typically find at a beach or resort store. Surf Expo is the only show focused exclusively on the water sports and resort sectors covering both hard goods and soft goods.

Attendees include retailers from independent and chain sporting stores, suppliers, mass market retailers, general merchandise and specialty stores, and fan shops. This is primarily an order-writing show with sales generated directly on the show floor.
Swim Collective and Active Collective Shows — The Swim Collective and Active Collective shows present swimwear, resort, and active wear collections to an audience of swimwear specialty retailers, active athleisure sport specialty retailers, swim and surf specialty retailers, gift and department stores, as well as luxury resorts, boutiques and cruise retailers.

In January 2017, we launched an Active Collective event in New York and, in August 2018, launched a Summer Active Collective event in New York.
Design & Construction
 We currently operate 8 trade shows in the Design & Construction industry sector catering to the construction, hospitality, and interior design sectors serving the hotel, resort, retail, healthcare facilities, restaurant, bar, spa, and in-store marketing categories. Targeted attendees include interior designers, architects, owners and operators, developers, and specifiers and purchasers working within these industries. This sector is well-suited for trade shows because design and construction are highly visual and tactile processes, requiring the in-person experience and interaction provided by trade shows. These trade shows enable designers and contractors to stay current with trends in product styles and techniques, which tend to change from year-to-year. Upcoming renovation and new-build construction projects are often discussed at these shows, making it important for both exhibitors and attendees to attend in order to stay close to the pipeline of future business. By aggregating a wide range of products under one roof, these trade shows save time and expense for designers and other attendees who would otherwise have to independently visit hundreds of showrooms that may be located in different cities. These shows are mostly lead-generating, enabling designers to see the latest trends and product offerings, and develop design ideas.
Hospitality Design Expo (“HD Expo”) — Held in Las Vegas each May, HD Expo is the largest trade show for the hospitality design industry serving the hotel, resort, restaurant, bar and cruise categories.

Other Marketing Services
 Other Marketing Services consist of print publications and digital media products that complement our trade show properties, and generated 7% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 Publications & Digital Products (Related Event)

Competition
 The trade show industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 9,400 B2B trade shows held per year in the United States according to the Center for Exhibition Industry Research, of which a majority are owned by industry associations, according to Advanced Market Research. Individual trade shows typically compete for attendees and exhibitors only against the other trade shows that are relevant to their industry vertical. The level of competition each of our trade shows faces therefore varies by industry vertical. 
 Other well-established for-profit companies competing in the U.S. trade show industry include Reed Exhibitions (RELX), Informa Exhibitions and Clarion Events.
 Seasonality
 As is typical for the trade show industry, our business is seasonal, with revenue recognized from trade shows typically reaching its highest levels during the first and third quarters of each calendar year, and its trough during the fourth quarter, largely due to the timing of our trade shows. In 2018, 37%, 21%, 27% and 15% of our trade show revenue was generated during the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively.
Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We undertake to strategically and proactively develop our intellectual property portfolio by registering our trademarks. We currently rely primarily on trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We do not own, but have a license to use, certain trademarks belonging to an industry association in connection with our Kitchen & Bath Industry Show and CEDIA Expo. The KBIS license runs through 2028 and the CEDIA Expo license continues in perpetuity.

Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 488 employees. We are not involved in any disputes with our employees and believe that relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements with unions. However, some facilities where we hold our trade shows require our decorators to use unionized labor.
Insurance
 We maintain insurance policies to cover the principal risks associated with our business, including event cancellation, business interruption, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, product liability, auto, property, and umbrella and excess liability insurance. All of our insurance policies are with third-party carriers and syndicates with financial ratings of A or better. We believe the premiums, deductibles, coverage limits and scope of coverage under such policies are reasonable and appropriate for our business. Event cancellation insurance provides coverage that allows us to refund a proportionate share, relative to the compromised enforced attendance reduction or show closure, of the deposits and booth and sponsorship fees paid to us by exhibitors in the event that we are forced to cancel a trade show or other event for reasons covered by the policies, such as natural disasters, communicable disease, terrorism, or venue closures. Business interruption insurance provides further coverage for our office property leases in cases where we are not able to conduct ongoing business, including sales and event planning. The continued availability of appropriate insurance policies on commercially reasonable terms is important to our ability to operate our business and to maintain our reputation. 
 Our event cancellation insurance, currently bound through the end of 2020, provides 100% indemnity for all of our events’ and conferences’ gross revenues individually and 50% in the aggregate. The coverage has no deductible and covers cancellation, curtailment, postponement, removal to alternative premises, or abandonment, of the event as well as enforced reduced attendance. In addition, coverage extends to include additional promotional and marketing expenses necessarily incurred by us should a covered loss occur. This insurance also extends to cover losses resulting from an outbreak of communicable disease as well as a terrorism endorsement covering an act of terrorism and/or threat of terrorism directed at the insured event or within the United States or its territories.
