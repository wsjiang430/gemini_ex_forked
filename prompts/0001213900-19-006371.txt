ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History and Background
 
Legacy Education Alliance, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on November 23, 2010 in Nevada under the name Streamline Resources, Inc. Our name was subsequently changed to Priced In Corp (“PRCD”) on April 24, 2012. Prior to the merger discussed below, we were a shell corporation with nominal operating activity. 
 
On November 10, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of such date the (“Merger Agreement”) by and among (i) PRCD, a Nevada corporation, (ii) Priced In Corp. Subsidiary, a Colorado corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PRCD (“PRCD Sub”), (iii) Tigrent Inc., a Colorado corporation (“TIGE”), and (iv) Legacy Education Alliance Holdings, Inc., a Colorado corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of TIGE (“Legacy Holdings”). On November 10, 2014, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, PRCD Sub merged with and into Legacy Holdings (the “Merger”), with Legacy Holdings surviving the Merger and becoming our wholly owned subsidiary and we acquired the business of Legacy Holdings.
 
At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”):
 

● | PRCD amended and restated its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which included an increase in our authorized stock to 220 million shares (200 million shares of common stock and 20 million shares of preferred stock); 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | PRCD changed its name from “Priced In Corp.” to “Legacy Education Alliance, Inc.”; 
● | All of the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Legacy Holdings outstanding at the Effective Time were converted and exchanged into 16,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), and were held by TIGE. 

 
As a result of the Merger, TIGE owned approximately 80% of Legacy with the then remaining outstanding shares (3,997,500) held by the existing PRCD shareholders.
 
There was no cash consideration exchanged in the Merger. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, PRCD agreed to pay TIGE taxes and related liabilities and other specified costs and expenses, including certain administrative and related expenses that have been or will be from time to time incurred by TIGE that are related to TIGE’s investment in PRCD (including the cost of preparing and distributing reports regarding our business and financial condition to its shareholders), its administrative costs and expenses, and taxes, other than income taxes arising from dividends or distributions by us to TIGE. All shares of PRCD common stock issued in connection with the Merger are restricted securities, as defined in paragraph (a) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Such shares were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated there under.
 
The Merger was accounted for as a “reverse merger” and recapitalization since, immediately following the completion of the transaction, the holders of TIGE’s stock had effective control of PRCD. In addition, TIGE controlled the surviving entity through control of Legacy’s Board of Directors as a result of the appointment of the existing directors of TIGE to the four board seats of Legacy. Additionally, all of TIGE’s officers and senior executive positions continued on as management of the surviving entity after consummation of the Merger. For accounting purposes, Legacy Holdings was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction was treated as a recapitalization of PRCD. Accordingly, Legacy Holdings’ assets, liabilities and results of operations became the historical financial statements of the registrant, and the Company’s assets, liabilities and results of operations were consolidated with PRCD effective as of the date of the closing of the Merger. Prior to the Merger, PRCD was a “shell” corporation with nominal assets, liabilities and operating activity. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction.

On February 14, 2017, TIGE completed the distribution of 15,998,326 shares of Common Stock in Legacy approved by the Board of Directors of TIGE on October 4, 2016. Pursuant to the distribution, 1.00105 shares of Legacy Common Stock were distributed for each share of stock held in TIGE. 
 
For a further discussion of the Merger and its effects on our business, please see the information contained in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on November 10, 2014 and the related amendments thereto.
 
We voluntarily filed a Form 10 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 12, 2017, and Amendment No 1 to Form 10 on June 27, 2017, to register our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On July 11, 2017, we announced that the filed Form 10 Registration Statement was effective on that day. A copy of the Form 10 Registration Statement is available on the Company’s website at (http://ir.legacyeducationalliance.com/all-sec-filings).

Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to be the leading global provider of services and products that enable individuals from all walks of life, regardless of their current economic situation and educational background, to take control of their financial futures and enable them to achieve financial freedom.
 
Our strategy is focused primarily on the following areas:

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These events have been well received by our customers, providing them with networking opportunities as well as bonus events and activities that have enhanced their experience. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will continue to monitor and enforce standards for marketing, sales presentations, and training delivery throughout our organization. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continued professional development. We will continue to identify, recruit and retain a team of trainers, mentors and coaches who possess practical, hands-on experience in their areas of expertise.

Recent Developments
 
On November 12, 2018, the Board of Directors of Legacy Education Alliance, Inc. (the “Company”) approved an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Rights Agreement dated as of February 16, 2017 by and between the Company and VStock Transfer LLC, as Rights Agent (the “Rights Agreement”), to (i) extend the Final Expiration Date, as defined in the Rights Agreement, to the close of business on February 15, 2021, and (ii) to provide for the construction of the Rights Agreement and all other related documents in a manner consistent with the extension of the Final Expiration Date.
 
On September 13, 2018, we entered into a Promissory Note and Mortgage and Security Agreement pursuant to which we borrowed the principal amount of $500 thousand from USA Growth Fund LLC. At closing, we received $459,269 in net proceeds after closing costs and other fees and costs. The Promissory Note, repayment of which was due on March 13, 2019, was issued in an aggregate principal amount of $500 thousand and bears interest at a fixed rate of 12% per annum during the initial 120 days of the term of the Promissory Note, and a fixed rate of 30% per annum until all amounts due under the Promissory Note are paid in full. Pursuant to the Mortgage and Security Agreement, repayment of the Promissory Note is secured by a first mortgage on the property located at 1612 East Cape Coral Parkway, Cape Coral, FL. 33904. On March 8th, 2019, we executed an extension of the maturity date to September 13, 2019.
 
Business Overview
 
We are a provider of practical, high-quality, and value-based educational training on the topics of personal finance, entrepreneurship, real estate and financial markets investing strategies and techniques. Our programs are offered through a variety of formats and channels, including free-preview workshops, basic training classes, symposiums, telephone mentoring, one-on-one mentoring, coaching and e-learning, primarily under the Rich Dad® Education brand (“Rich Dad”) which was created in 2006 under license from entities affiliated with Robert Kiyosaki, whose teachings and philosophies are detailed in the book titled, Rich Dad Poor Dad. In addition to Rich Dad, we market our products and services under a variety of brands, Making Money from Property with Martin RobertsTM; Brick Buy BrickTM; Building Wealth; Robbie Fowler Property AcademyTM; Women in WealthTM; Perform in PropertyTM, Teach Me to TradeTM, and Trade Up Investor EducationTM. Our products and services are offered in North America, the United Kingdom and Other Foreign Markets.
 
Our students pay for their courses in full up-front or through payment agreements with independent third parties. Under United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), we recognize revenue upon the earlier of (i) when our students take their courses or (ii) the term for taking their course expires, both of which could be several quarters after the student purchases a program and pays the fee. Our symposiums combine multiple advanced training courses in one location, allowing us to achieve certain economies of scale that reduce costs and improve margins while also accelerating U.S. GAAP revenue recognition, while at the same time, enhancing our students’ experience, particularly, for example, through the opportunity to network with other students.
 
We also provide a richer experience for our students through one-on-one mentoring (two to four days in length, on site or remotely) and telephone mentoring (10 to 16 weekly one-on-one or one-on-many telephone sessions). Mentoring involves a subject matter expert interacting with the student remotely or in person and guiding the student, for example, through his or her first real estate transaction, providing a real hands-on experience.
 
We historically managed our business in four segments based on geographic location. These segments included our historical core markets of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with the fourth segment including all Other Foreign Markets. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, our management decided to combine the previously reported United States and Canada segments into the North America segment effective for the 2017 year-end reporting and since such date our operations have been managed through three segments: (i) North America, (ii) United Kingdom, (iii) Other Foreign Markets.

Marketing
 
Our various brands are the foundation for our marketing efforts. These brands provide credibility and sustainability within our media mix to promote live events and online trainings. Live onsite two-hour free preview workshops are offered weekly in four to six markets in North America and United Kingdom. Marketing these events is primarily done online through internet banner ads, text ads, and emails. Direct mail, radio, television, public relations, social media and print advertising are also used to obtain event registrations. We enter into marketing and other agreements with third-parties to market our products and services.
 
We offer people the opportunity to attend a free preview workshop or advance directly to one of our three-day basic training classes. People who enroll and attend the basic training class receive reference materials relevant to the subject matter to be taught at the class. The basic training course is usually held over a weekend within two to four weeks of the initial free preview workshop. Our experience is that offering the free preview workshop as a first step is an effective way to introduce to our students the methodology of investing, as well as to market and sell our three-day basic training courses.
 
Marketing efforts continue to those customers who choose to continue their education with a three-day basic training class. Welcome letters, product kits that include manuals, books and audio files, an online reference library, and reminder communication letters and emails are all branded for consistency and credibility. Customers at the three-day basic training may choose to continue on with their education through our elite training classes and mentorships offered during the basic training classes.
 
We utilize multiple preview brands to market into our advance training division, which we re-branded to Elite Legacy Education to expand our market reach. Elite training classes are fulfilled through various delivery methods to meet the needs of our customers.
 
We also market for new customers who prefer to learn online and provide people the opportunity to attend free ninety-minute live online webinars that are held weekly on six different topics. Webinars are marketed via online banner ads, affiliate marketing, email campaigns, social media and other media methods.
 
Training Programs
 
We have three significant categories for our programs:
 

● | Basic training live and online courses, 
--+------------------------------------------------------
● | Elite level live and online training courses, and 
● | Individualized mentoring programs.

The goal of our fulfillment strategy is to provide maximum flexibility to the students to allow them take any of their classes in whatever format, and in any combination of formats, that works best for them. Students may access training content through multiple delivery channels, including:
 

● | Live Classroom: In-person “one-on-many” intensive 3-day class with a live instructor and any number of students in the same room, either at a symposium or as a stand-alone class. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Live Stream: Interactive real-time streaming of a Live Classroom training that may be viewed by a student remotely via the internet. Live stream classes can be reviewed for 30-days post-class. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Live On-Line: Live presentations of a class in modules presented over a period of weeks with a live instructor and any number of students in any number of locations who attend remotely via the internet. Student has access to recordings of the modules for 30 days after the last live session. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On-Demand: Class that is presented in self-paced pre-recorded modules via internet link with 24/7 access for the life of the contract. Unlike the three “live” fulfillment options, which require the student to attend classes when LEAI schedules them, the On-Demand Options provides the student the flexibility to take the class whenever they want, and as many times as they want, during the life of the student’s contract. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Through strategic partners, customers can purchase a license to use supporting software for real estate or financial markets investing. With either software program, a subscription-based data service is available for purchase which allows customers to interactively determine investment options and make better informed decisions about potential investments.
 
Individualized Mentoring and Coaching Programs
 
We offer live, real time, one-on-one mentoring for Real Estate, Business and the Financial Markets that are tailored to meet students’ individual goals and needs. Real Estate mentoring is offered on site at the student’s chosen location, while Financial Market mentoring can be provided either on-site or remotely. Mentoring is intended to give the student a professional assessment of his or her individual goals and experience and to help the student build an investment plan that can be put into action. Mentoring sessions are generally 2 to 4 days in length.
 
Coaching and telephone mentoring programs are typically sold in a number of different subject areas and generally delivered in 10 to 16 weekly one-on-one telephone sessions. Some of the topics include Real Estate Coaching, Financial Markets Coaching and Business Coaching. A set curriculum approach is generally used. Each module comes with assignments, exercises and reading materials to be completed between sessions.
 
Geographic Diversification
 
We historically managed our business in four segments based on geographic location. These segments included our historical core markets of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with the fourth segment including all Other Foreign Markets. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s management decided to combine the previously reported United States and Canada segments into the North America segment effective for the 2017 year-end reporting, and since such date, our operations have been managed through three operating segments: (i) North America, (ii) United Kingdom, and (iii) Other Foreign Markets.
Competition
 
During our more than 20-year history, we have competed with a number of organizations within the U.S. and internationally. Our primary competitors are Fortune Builders, Armando Montelongo, Zurixx, Dean Graziosi, Flip Advantage, Flipping Formula, Winning the Property War, Yancey Co, Nick Virtucci and Success Resources. Some of these competitors have established brands through a media-based relationship, such as HGTV, and use television programs to promote their brands.
 
The main competitors to our financial markets strategies and techniques course offerings are large institutional brokerage houses, who have been offering education as a way to expand their client portfolio.
 
Generally, competitive factors within the proprietary training market include:
 

● | The range and depth of course offerings; 
--+---------------------------------------------


● | The quality of trainers;
--+-------------------------


● | The quality of reference materials provided in connection with course studies; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cost.
--+------

 
We believe that the range and depth of our course offerings, the quality of our trainers and reference materials are comparable or superior to those of our competitors. Typically, our trainers for our Elite courses have been active investors in their chosen field, have been trained by us and, to a large degree, are previous customers of our programs. Trainers for our Elite courses are chosen based on their knowledge and experience with the coursework covered, and are further qualified by meeting knowledge standards developed internally.

Licensing Agreements with the Rich Dad Parties
 
Our primary business relies on our license of the Rich Dad brand and related marks and intellectual property. The following transactions summarize our license to use the Rich Dad trademarks, trade names and other business information worldwide (the “Rich Dad Intellectual Property Rights”):
 
Effective September 1, 2013, we entered into licensing and related agreements with Rich Dad Operating Company, LLC (“RDOC”) (collectively, the “2013 License Agreement”) that replaced the 2010 License Agreement. Compared to the 2010 License Agreement, the 2013 License Agreement broadened the field of use to include real estate investing, business strategies, stock market investment techniques, stock/paper assets, cash management, asset protection, entrepreneurship and other financially-oriented subjects. The 2013 License Agreement also (i) reduced the royalty rate payable to RDOC compared to the 2010 Rich Dad License Agreement; (ii) broadened the Company’s exclusivity rights to include education seminars delivered in any medium; (iii) eliminated the cash collateral requirements and related financial covenants contained in the 2010 License Agreement; (iv) continues our right to pay royalties via a promissory note that is convertible to preferred shares upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the 2013 License Agreement); (v) eliminated approximately $1.6 million in debt from our consolidated balance sheet as a result of debt forgiveness provided for in the agreement terminating the 2010 License Agreement; and (vi) converted another approximately $4.6 million in debt to 1,549,882 shares of our Common Stock. Either party may terminate the 2013 License Agreement upon certain circumstances, including and uncured breach by the non-terminating party.
 
On April 22, 2014, we entered into an agreement with RDOC (the “2014 Amendment”) to, among other things, amend the 2013 License Agreement to halve the royalty payable by us to RDOC to 2.5% for the whole of 2014, (ii) cancel approximately $1.3 million in debt owed by us to RDOC, (iii) reimburse us for certain legal expenses, and (iv) cancel RDOC’s right to appoint one member of our Board of Directors.
 
The 2013 License Agreement and the 2014 Amendment were assigned to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Legacy Education Alliance Holdings, Inc. on September 10, 2014.
 
On January 25, 2018, we entered into a Second Amendment with RDOC (the “Second Amendment”) that amends certain terms of the 2013 License Agreement and extends the term of the 2013 License Agreement to September 1, 2019. In addition, the Company and two of its officers, and RDOC and certain individuals affiliated with RDOC, entered into a Mutual Waiver and Release of Claims. (See the Form 8-K filed on January 29, 2018 for further discussion.)
 
License Agreement with Robbie Fowler
 
We entered into a Talent Endorsement Agreement with an effective date of January 1, 2015 with Robbie Fowler that supplements an earlier November 2, 2012 Agreement and a Talent Endorsement Agreement with an effective date of January 1, 2013, both with Mr. Fowler (collectively, the “Fowler License Agreement”). The Fowler License Agreement grants us the exclusive right to use Robbie Fowler’s name, image, and likeness in connection with the advertisement, promotion, and sale in the United Kingdom of a property training course developed by us. The Fowler License Agreement will expire by its terms on January 1, 2020. Under the Fowler License Agreement, we pay Mr. Fowler a royalty on revenues realized from the sale of Robbie Fowler-branded property courses and affiliated products, after deductions for value added taxes, returns and refunds.
License Agreement with Martin Roberts
 
In 2009, we entered into a Talent Endorsement Agreement with Martin Roberts that grants us the exclusive right to use Martin Roberts’, name, image, and likeness, as well as the rights to use the name of Mr. Roberts’s published book entitled “Making Money From Property,” in connection with the advertisement, promotion, and sale in the United Kingdom of a property training course developed by us. We entered into a subsequent Talent Endorsement Agreement with an effective date of April 20th, 2017 (the “Supplemental Agreement”) that grants us the non-exclusive right to use Martin Roberts’ name, image and likeness, as well as the rights to use the name of Mr. Roberts’ published book entitled “Making Money From Property”, in connection with the advertisement, promotion, and sale of educational training, products and materials related to real estate, securities and options trading and investment, as well as, general wealth building and investing strategies, principles and motivation. The term of the license granted under the Supplemental Agreement is for an initial six months period expiring on October 20, 2017 and will continue thereafter unless (i) terminated by one party upon the event of certain specified defaults of the party, or (ii) by either party without cause upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party. Under the Supplemental Agreement with Mr. Roberts, we pay Mr. Roberts a royalty on revenues realized from the sale of Robbie Fowler-branded property courses and affiliated products that are collected within thirty (30) days after a Company-sponsored Martin Roberts-branded event, after deductions for value added taxes, banking charges, returns, refunds, and third party commissions. For sales to clients introduced to us directly by Mr. Roberts and his associated websites as well as other marketing and promotional activities Mr. Roberts or his associated companies may wish to undertake from time to time that are not part of a Company sponsored event and which result in the sale of ours basic training her marketing and promotional activities, Mr. Roberts is entitled to 50% of gross revenue from such sales of directly introduced clients.

Employees and Independent Contractors
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 165 full-time employees of whom 141, or 85%, were located in our North America segment and the remaining 15% were located in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Hong Kong. In addition, we employ part-time employees in various capacities and independent contractors who are trainers, coaches or mentors. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, and we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory. Our independent contractors are either paid commissions based upon the dollar value of the courses purchased by customers at our free preview workshops and basic training courses, or are paid fixed fees for teaching and mentoring Elite courses. Independent contractors are required to execute agreements with us that set forth their commission structures and typically contain confidentiality and non-competition provisions.
