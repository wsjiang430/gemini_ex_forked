Item 1. Business Overview
 
Ipsidy Inc. (formerly known as ID Global Solutions Corporation) (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “we” or “our”) operates an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) platform that delivers a suite of secure, mobile, biometric identity solutions, available to any vertical, anywhere. In a world that is increasingly digital and mobile, our mission is to help our customers know with biometric certainty the identity of the people with whom they are engaging. We provide solutions to everyday problems: Who is applying for a loan? Who is accessing the computer system? Who is at the door?
 
Ipsidy provides secure, biometric identification, identity verification and electronic transaction authentication and processing services. We have developed an identity transaction platform for our customers, be they businesses, residences, governments, or other organizations, to enable their users to more easily verify and authenticate their identity through a mobile phone or portable device of their choosing (as opposed to dedicated hardware). Our system enables participants to complete transactions with a digitally signed authentication response, including the underlying transaction data. In this way our systems can provide pre-transaction authentication of identity as well as embed each user’s identity attributes, within every electronic transaction message processed through our platform, or other electronic systems.
 
We believe that it is essential that businesses and consumers know who is on the other side of an electronic transaction and have an audit trail, proving that the identity of the other party was duly authenticated. Our solutions are intended to provide our customers with the next level of transaction security, control and certainty. Our platform uses biometric and multi-factor identity solutions, which are intended to support a wide variety of electronic transactions. We define “electronic transactions” in the broadest sense to include not only financial transactions (i.e. exchanges of value in all of their forms), and legal transactions (e.g. approving the release of personal or other confidential data), but also access control to physical environments (e.g. entrances to offices, public buildings, data centers and other sensitive locations) and digital environments (e.g. accessing financial accounts, voting systems, email systems and controlling data network log-ins).
 
The Company’s products focus on the broad requirement for identity verification and authentication, and access and transaction controls and associated identity management needs. Organizations of all descriptions require cost-effective and secure mobile electronic transaction solutions for them and their customers. We aim to offer our customers solutions that can be integrated into each customer’s business and organizational operations in order to facilitate their use and enhance the end user customer experience.
 
Our digital mobile wallet applications, or electronic account holders are used to contain different services and accounts that can be easily added and enable users to conveniently and securely effect a variety of electronic transactions, using their identity. One example is for consumers and employees to use their mobile application to authenticate identity, in order to access secure digital, or physical environments. We recently announced the launch of our integrated Verified solution with Datapro as an add-on to their online banking software. Another example is our closed-loop payment account, digital issuance platform, that is intended to offer secure and cost-effective methods of conversion of cash and paper to electronic payments.
 
The Company’s solutions for fingerprint-based identity management and electronic payment transaction processing have been in the market for several years. For example, in December 2017, we won an international competitive tender to provide our IDSearch Automated Fingerprint Identification de-duplication system (AFIS) to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, for them to ensure that no duplicate entries existed in the voter roll for the 2018 election. The AFIS system was delivered under tight deadlines and within budget, in order to enable the voter roll to be published and the election to occur as planned.
 
Management believes that some of the advantages of the Company’s Identity Transaction Platform approach are the ability to leverage the platform to support a variety of vertical markets including the identity solutions and transaction processing sectors and the adaptability of the platform to the requirements of new markets and new products requiring low cost, secure, and configurable mobile solutions. These vertical markets include but are not limited to banking and payment transactions, elections, schools, public transportation, government and enterprise security. At its core, the Company’s offering, combining its proprietary biometric technologies, with those acquired is intended to facilitate the processing of diverse electronic transactions, be they payments, votes, or physical or digital access, all of which can include identity verification, authentication and identity transaction recording. The Company continues to invest in developing, patenting and acquiring the various elements necessary to enhance the platform, which is intended to allow us to achieve our goals.
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 21, 2011 and changed its name to Ipsidy Inc. on February 1, 2017, and our common stock is traded on the OTCQX U.S. Market under the trading symbol “IDTY”. Our corporate headquarters is located at 780 Long Beach Blvd., Long Beach, NY 11561 and our main phone number is (516) 274-8700. We maintain a website at www.ipsidy.com.

Global Market Opportunity
 
We believe that there are several market trends that drive growth in the identity solutions and electronic transaction processing marketplace, including growing concerns over identity theft and fraud and the increase in electronic payments, and solutions provided by non-bank entities. Moreover, the individual’s increasing reliance on devices of their choosing, most often a mobile phone, or portable computing device requires solutions providers to incorporate these technologies into their offerings.
 
While an increasingly digital world drives convenience, it also drives an increasing risk of compromised passwords, security breaches and stolen identities. With every online purchase, e-bill payment and download of new travel, dining and gaming ‘apps’ to a mobile smartphone, the footprint of consumers’ digital identity expands. According to credit reporting company Experian, e-Commerce fraud attacks in the United States increased by 30% in 2017 compared to 2016, while overall eCommerce volumes were up only 16%, indicating that fraud increased at double the rate of e-Commerce sales. (Source Experian: 2017 E-Commerce Fraud Report). The number of fraud victims in the U.S. rose by eight percent in 2017 to total 16.7 million, according to data released by Javelin Strategy & Research in February 2018. U.S. consumers experienced a total of $16.8 billion in fraud losses (Source: February 12, 2018 ABA Banking Journal)
 
For social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, trying to combat fake news and media manipulation, one of the biggest challenges they face is adequately identifying who is posting items on their sites, in order to enforce their Community Standards policies. According to Facebook’s Community Standards Enforcement Report first published in May 2018, they disabled 583 million fake accounts in the first quarter of 2018, in Q2 the number increased to 800 million and in the third quarter a further 754 million fake accounts were closed down. They also state that Facebook prevented millions more fake accounts from being registered. This staggering total of more than 2.1 Billion fake accounts – is similar in number to the total legitimate accounts. (Source: Facebook Community Standards Enforcement Report, November 2018).
 
To combat fraud and to better confirm customers’ identities, we see an increasing deployment of biometric solutions in the marketplace. In their 2016 report, Goode Intelligence forecast that by 2020 over 1.1 billion financial services customers will be using mobile biometrics to access and secure their accounts, and more than 16 billion mobile biometric payment transactions will be made.
 
Despite heightened awareness of digital security resulting from a number of high profile incidents, including those at Google+ and Marriott Hotels that exposed personal data of hundreds of millions of consumers, access to digital services and thus our identities is still secured in the majority of cases only through a simple username and password, although more services are introducing two factor authentication. In the United States, the most common identifier is still the social security number, which hacks of Government databases have shown is very vulnerable to being stolen. Governments, institutions and enterprises have therefore become concerned to find more secure ways to verify and authenticate identity and manage the identities of the persons with whom they need to interact, be they employees, customers, authorized users or citizens.
 
Businesses spend significant capital on acquiring and deploying dedicated equipment to fulfill a variety of their business requirements. The ubiquitous availability and use of mobile devices, which consumers have become accustomed to using for a wide variety of functions, creates the opportunity to dispense with dedicated equipment in favor of an easily downloadable “app” for a mobile device. We are continuing to enhance our solutions for our customers in order to take advantage of this global trend. One example would be access to a locked door by recognition of the presence of the user’s phone instead of a hardware token, using the security features of a mobile device enabled with the Company’s suite of identity solutions. The Company is also enhancing our Access solution by adding frictionless, biometric authentication using IP cameras, under our agreement with Ayonix announced in 2018.
 
Electronic payments of all forms have continued to grow at a healthy rate. According to Internet Retailer, citing figures from the U.S Commerce Department, consumers spent $453.46 billion on the Internet for retail purchases in 2017, a 16.0% increase compared with $390.99 billion in 2016. That represents the highest growth rate since 2011, when online sales grew 17.5% over 2010. (Source: Stefany Zaroban, Digital Commerce 360, “U.S. E-commerce Sales Grow 16% in 2017” Feb 16, 2018). According to Forrester Research, US retail sales made via smart phone will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18% in 2019, and will impact more than $1 trillion in revenues at some point in the customer journey. (Source: Threat Matrix, “4 Mobile Fraud Trends to Watch out for in 2019” January 3, 2019)


The growth in electronic payments reflects the importance of the “hidden payments” market, namely payments undertaken by means of closed loop cards and mobile apps, digital wallets offered by non-banks, mobile money offered by non-banks and virtual currencies.
 
The key drivers for these alternative payment methods is the cost savings to the merchants while satisfying consumer’s demand for convenient payment transactions with less friction. The gaps in the existing value propositions offered by the banks arise mainly because of legacy systems and regulatory constraints. These can stifle innovation and prevent consumers from easy access to the banks’ traditional payment services. In a growing electronic payments market, these alternative payment methods are therefore perceived by the industry as an important route for both innovation and financial inclusion.

Growth Strategy
 
We seek to extend our position and execute our business plan by continuing to penetrate our existing markets and expand into new geographies and market segments. Our goal is to continue to deliver innovative security and payment services to our customers that help them achieve their operational or business goals. The execution of our strategy is subject to our obtaining sufficient additional working capital to finance the various initiatives discussed, whether through investment or otherwise. The key components of our strategy are discussed below.
 
Cross sell to existing customers
 
The Company is examining opportunities to offer its new platform capabilities and solutions to existing customers. Tokenization of transactions is also a secure processing methodology that has numerous applications across different customer use cases. The Company believes that by using our core technologies we will be able to create a platform that combines our identity technologies with our payment processing capabilities, and thereby, have a more complete offering for customers that are ultimately using only one of those services.
 
Add new customers
 
The Company plans to grow its core business through focused sales and marketing of its current products and solutions, as well as its newly developed platforms and solutions. We have added sales, marketing and product professionals who are developing additional distribution channels and seeking out new customers. We are leveraging our internal personnel with resellers, agents and distribution partners, who generally are focused on a particular industry vertical and have an existing customer base to which they can offer our products, in addition to their existing lines. Some of the industry sectors covered by our resellers include e-commerce merchants, facilities management, logistics, houses of worship and communal organizations. These resellers enable us to target a significantly larger customer base, while maintaining a lower overhead of our own FTE’s sales personnel.
 
Channel Strategy
 
The Company believes that its channel strategy will be an effective way to bring its products and solutions to a broad market in an efficient and cost-effective way. We have signed and are pursuing channel partners, that play a key role in their respective verticals, such as Datapro a technology provider for banks, SafeTrade for e-commerce business in Africa and Skypatrol logistics company for the trucking industry. These channel partners provide access to their customers, who in turn work with many thousands of individual consumers and businesses all of whom could benefit from the use of our solutions. By entering into agreements with such channel partners and leveraging their relationships, we believe we can expand our footprint much more rapidly and cost effectively, as compared to pursuing separate agreements with each customer.

Enter new markets
 
The Company has already entered new markets by virtue of our subsidiaries in Colombia and South Africa. The Company believes that the solutions that are currently being offered and developed in those countries will be suitable to be similarly offered in other emerging markets in the Latin American and African regions. Furthermore, the improvements to the Company’s platforms and the expansion of the sales teams are being undertaken with a view to being able to support transaction processing and customers across borders without the need to establish and build new facilities in each new country, thereby reducing the costs of entry into each new market.
 
Innovation
 
As the electronic and cybersecurity industry continues to evolve, we aim to be at the forefront by developing new services and solutions that leverage our platform and core competencies and thereby enable us to enter new markets, attract new customers and retain existing ones. We also believe it will be critical to our growth for us to continue to enhance our platform capabilities. We believe the development of new services and solutions will be an important revenue source in the future, and enable us to continue to differentiate our platform and capabilities. The Company believes that by using our core technologies we will be able to create solutions that address some of today’s major global market challenges and opportunities arising in identity solutions and access control, coupled with the ubiquitous use of mobile devices. By combining our core technologies, we have built an identity transaction platform using biometric and multi-factor identity solutions, which are intended to support a wide variety of electronic transactions.
Select Acquisitions
 
As we have done in the past, we intend to selectively pursue acquisitions that will help us achieve our strategic goals, enhance our technology capabilities and accelerate growth. We believe pursuing these types of acquisitions will increase our ability to work with existing customers, add new customers, enter new markets, develop new services and enhance our processing platform capabilities. However, we have no commitments with respect to any such acquisitions at this time.
Marketing and Sales
 
The Company has hired a Director of Marketing to develop and implement a robust marketing and content strategy.   The marketing team is tasked with sharpening external brand messaging to help focus the mission, sales strategy and product development as the Company strives to reach new target markets and customers. The objective is to produce industry-specific marketing assets that highlight our platform, solutions, and their role in digital transformation.  The Company plans to undertake a balanced mix of marketing activities including digital advertising, increased social media presence, email campaigns, and newly developed web-content.   Existing marketing assets and sales support materials will be refreshed, revamped, and in many cases simplified for cohesion, ease of use, and rapid comprehension & consumption.
 
The Marketing, Sales, and Product Development and Customer Success teams are collaborating closely to develop products that our target customers need and want and to convert prospects into new customers with simplified on-boarding experiences. The Sales and Marketing Teams are also focusing on driving sales and new revenue by developing, attracting, and supporting a partner network of resellers and technology integrators. 
 
Revenue Model
 
Identity Management Solutions and Products
 
The biometric software products are priced based on a multi-year licensing model which is driven by the number of enrollees in the system. The Company expects to provide its new identity transaction platform services based on a subscription model, with tiered fees per enrolled user, card or device, comprising an initial enrollment fee, a periodic subscription and where applicable a per transaction fee. The Company’s CardPlus plastic and credentials card products are sold at a per unit price which will vary based on the configuration of the features and functionality of the product, as well as the services provided.
Payment Processing Solutions and Products
 
The electronic payment gateway services are volume priced on a per transaction basis. The pricing for the Company’s new closed loop financial payment platform is expected to be based on a combination of transaction fee and a subscription model based on numbers of cardholders and merchants enrolled. The Company also earns leasing income from the rental of unattended kiosks.
Competition
 
The Company has created an identity transaction platform allowing it to on-board customers who wish to deploy Ipsidy’s services and solutions in order to know with biometric certainty who is engaging with them. Ipsidy’s solutions include the ability to verify the identity of a user, via remote identity proofing, then provide physical and digital access, as well as transaction and device authentication, all digitally signed by the user using their identity. The Company’s platform utilizes commodity, consumer grade mobile devices for customer deployment with users engaging the platform via a corresponding Android or iOS smartphone app.
 
The Company also offers certain payment processing solutions and smart card products manufacturing and printing. The industry sectors in which these products compete are characterized by rapid change and new entrants. The Company will need to consistently develop and improve its products in order to remain competitive. 
 
In reviewing the competitors that exist for the Company’s current and planned products and platform services relating to biometric identity solutions, the Company considers a number of factors. Ipsidy’s platform approach offers an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) approach which seeks to combine a number of different elements into a single platform. Ipsidy believes that its full stack platform is exceptional in that it provides a combination of SaaS based identity verification and identification services which cover both physical and digital identity access use cases. The competitive landscape includes several companies that mainly address only one or other area, with some addressing multiple areas independently. However, it is believed that some companies are attempting to create combined identity offerings, similar to Ipsidy’s. 
 
In looking at our competition, the Company does not consider providers who do not offer a consumer application solution for smartphones, such as the Ipsidy App. Neither do we consider competitors, which are major conglomerates with vertically integrated cybersecurity companies, due to the vast array of services which they offer. Furthermore, some of the competitors which do offer solutions for both digital and physical use cases, are major legacy providers offering hardware heavy solutions principally for governmental users. These include IDEMIA, Gemalto and Supercom. This is in contrast to Ipsidy’s approach which is based on offering apps which are usable on mobile devices with minimal hardware requirements. Furthermore, our identity solutions are designed to address the requirements of private, commercial and governmental uses for enrolled users. 
 
To further analyze the competitive landscape, the market must be segmented into authentication solution vendors and biometric identification & verification solution providers. Major competitors offering solutions in both areas include IDEMIA, Gemalto, ID.ME, HID Global, Yoti and Aware. Major competitors offering only authentication, include Twillio/Authy, HYPR, Datacard, Duo, Daon, and Trusona. Companies offering only biometric identification & verification include NEC, Imageware, Element, and Veridium.

The Ipsidy identity transaction platform is based on a patent-pending methodology, which combines digital signature authentication and biometric identity verification into a single out-of-band transaction. This provides functionality for our customers to have real-time control over their electronic transactions and every-day events through a mobile application, with a detailed audit trail created for each event, containing the digitally signed transaction details and biometric identity of the user. This patent-pending approach of combining transaction details and identity into a single, digitally signed message could allow the Ipsidy platform to be a complimentary solution to many of its competitors and hence differentiate itself in the market. 
 
Companies that focused on offerings for ID proofing, include Jumio and Mitek. Companies that provide a single solution may be seeking to combine with authentication and biometric verification technology providers to expand their ID proofing solutions’ capabilities. The Ipsidy platform now offers its own identity proofing service for use in digital onboarding solutions, in conjunction with our biometric authentication and verification solutions. 
 
Another aspect of the competitive landscape for platform service arises from market demand for SaaS based identity services that are both high assurance and low friction. This combination is the ideal balance that Ipsidy and its competitors are trying to achieve. Companies that are believed to be competing with Ipsidy with their offerings today are Callsign, Gemalto, Danal (acquired by Boku in 2018), Datacard/Entrust, and IDEMIA (Formerly Morpho and Obertur). Ipsidy is seeking to improve its position with respect to these competitors in part through the new facial recognition solution which is currently under development, as part of the technology partnership announced with Ayonix. This is intended to reduce friction in Ipsidy’s Access product offering for physical security by the use of IP cameras to obtain the live capture facial images. In addition, Ipsidy offers its customers the flexibility to adapt its solutions to their specific use cases for either high assurance or to decrease friction. 
 
With respect to SaaS based services for physical identity access management, the competitive landscape for Ipsidy also includes companies such as HID Global, NEC, and IDEMIA. All of these companies offer a broad range of solutions from complete biometric access control systems to complex biometric e-gate and passenger flow management solutions. Ipsidy’s offering focuses on the SaaS based biometric identity solutions portion of this market, using mobile apps but also offers API integration with hardware suppliers to create competitive solutions. 
 
There are new entrants into each of these markets continually. Each competitor may have a different offering or approach to solve similar problems, which overlap with those of the Company. Some competitors also include manufacturers who provide systems, or platform solutions to third party operators and, therefore, do not directly compete with the Company, which operates its own systems.
 
The Cards Plus business faces competition both locally in South Africa and internationally. China has become a source of imports of card products at highly competitive pricing and some local suppliers are reliant on Chinese card manufacturers. Local competitors include Card Technology Services, Easy Card and Open Gate, Cardz Group and XH Smart Technology (Africa). That said, we believe that we are the only significant manufacturer in South Africa using digital print technology. 
 
The payment processing industry has many competitors who provide gateway services, closed loop end-to-end solutions, payment processing, peer-to-peer payments and bill payments. As these types of services are usually supplied by regional or country specific companies, the following summary of this competitive landscape, is focused on those countries or regions the Company is actively pursuing business in today. In Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America where the Company is focused, major competitors include PayU, Credibanco, Redeban, Mercado Pago, Nequi, and QPagos. Some of these companies may on the other hand be potential customers for our identify transaction platform and biometric authentication services. Companies in this region that also compete in those sectors include Veritran, Certicamaras, Olimpia IT, Evertec-Processa and Indra.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
The Company does not need or require any approval from government authorities or agencies in order to operate its regular business and operations. However, it is possible that any proposed expansion to the Company’s business and operations in the future would require government approvals.
 
Due to the security applications and biometric technology associated with the Company’s products and platforms, the activities and operations of the Company are subject to license restrictions and other regulations, such as (without limitation) export controls and other security regulation by government agencies. Expansion of the Company’s activities in payment processing may in due course require government licensing in different jurisdictions and may subject it to additional regulation and oversight.
 
Data protection legislation in various countries in which the Company does business (including Colombia and the United Kingdom) may require it to register its databases with governmental authorities in those countries and to comply with additional disclosure and consent requirements with regard to the collection, storage and use of personal information of individuals resident in those countries.
 
Employees and Organization
 
The Company, as of December 31, 2018, had a total of approximately 85 employees as well as outsourced service providers that are located in four countries: Colombia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. Beginning in 2017, employees in the U.S. started receiving health benefits on a cost sharing basis and employees in Colombia and South Africa are provided the respective Government required benefits. The Company may enhance or offer additional fringe and welfare benefits in the future as the Company’s profits grow and/or the Company secures additional outside financing.
Subsidiaries
 
Currently, the Company has three U.S. subsidiaries: Innovation in Motion Inc., Fin Holdings, Inc., and ID Solutions Inc. The Company has three subsidiaries in Colombia: MultiPay S.A.S., IDGS LATAM S.A.S., and IDGS S.A.S..The Company has one subsidiary in South Africa: CardsPlus Pty Ltd. The Company has one subsidiary in the United Kingdom: Ipsidy Enterprises Limited. The Company is the sole shareholder of all of its subsidiaries.
