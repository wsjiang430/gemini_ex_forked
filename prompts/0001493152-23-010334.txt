(“AEI”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to up to 44,619,423 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”) for a purchase price of $0.3810 per share. If required by the rules and regulations of the NYSE American, LLC, the issuance of the shares will be subject to the approval of the Company’s shareholders.
 
On March 03, 2022, Impact Biomedical, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of DSS, Inc, along with its scientific research partner Global Research and Discovery Group Sciences, (“GRDG”) announced it had received a positive report regarding the potential international patentability of its proprietary compound Equivir to treat viral infections which has shown potential to limit the occurrence of, and reduce, the risk or severity of viral outbreaks.
 
On June 07, 2022, DSS announced that Global BioLife, Inc, a division of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Impact BioMedical, was granted a patent from the China National Intellectual Property Administration (“CNIPA”) for 3F™, a Functional Fragrance Formulation technology that is effective as a mosquito repellant through a fragrant compound derived from botanical oils. This complements the corresponding U.S. patent granted (U.S. 11,246,310). 3F™ is an extremely effective mosquito repellant. The repellant is believed to incapacitate two of the three receptors that mosquitoes use to find sources of nutrition. During the past year, Impact BioMedical has laid the groundwork for a future that is focused on scientifically tested, high-impact solutions to global problems that humans are facing from food preservation to antibiotics to creating new ways to develop medicines. Impact Biomedical and GRDG announced a U.S. patent (US 10,966,424) allowance for 3F™DB in June 2021.
 
On June 28, 2022, Impact Biomedical, Inc, along with its scientific research partner GRDG, announced that it signed a license agreement with ProPhase Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRPH) for Equivir, which has shown potential as a treatment to limit the occurrence of or reduce the risk or severity of viral outbreaks. Since 2019 Equivir as a treatment against viral infections has received two U.S. patents and a positive patentability report opening the door for international patent possibilities. The composition is believed to work by potentially blocking the entry of a virus into host cells, which prevents infection and replication in those host cells. Equivir is a blend of FDA Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) eligible polyphenols. The composition is projected to come in capsule form and be taken much like a multivitamin.
 
On July 13, 2022, DSS announced the expansion of its Board of Directors with the appointment of two independent directors, Shui Yeung Frankie Wong, a 20-year veteran of public-company financial reporting, and Hiu Pan Joanne Wong, an investment manager with BMI Funds Management Ltd., the leading financial advisor in Hong Kong.

LineBacker is anticipated to be effective in crossing the blood-brain barrier and would be delivered orally. Significant pre-clinical testing has been completed in neurology, anti-inflammatory, oncology, anti-infective, and viral disease states to demonstrate response to LineBacker.
 
On July 26, 2022, DSS Inc, announced that less than a year after successfully synthesizing its first Quantum-based compound, Impact Biomedical, Inc. and its research partner GRDG developed a Quantum antihistamine that could shift how medicine is administered while moving the pharmaceutical industry away from an impending patent cliff.


On October 19, 2022, GRDG, a scientific research partner of Impact BioMedical, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of DSS, Inc, announced that it will be the subject of a documentary film highlighting the passion, the search, and the cutting-edge discoveries that push the company behind a single-minded goal: creating a healthier world quickly and naturally. The documentary project comes on the heels of GRDG’s completion of Sombrero, a five-year multi-pronged project that yielded multiple patents and potentially billions of dollars in licensing opportunities.

STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN AND 2022 PROGRESSION
 
2022 was forecasted to be a breakout year for DSS. The DSS team delivered on this objective as the Company excelled under the first year of the rebranded DSS, Inc., driving strong top-line growth across our diverse business lines and fortifying our foundation for accelerated growth and value creation moving forward. The Company and team of employees around the world have achieved great progress, collectively and individually. This forward movement is a function of continual investments in our people, systems, and companies, in good and bad times, to build the Company’s capabilities.
 
Revenues, as of December 31, 2022, have more than doubled from the end of 2021, and the total assets, now at nearly $249 million, have grown more than 1,000%, up from under $20 million, since the start of transforming DSS just over three years ago in late 2019.
 
Importantly, the acquisition of new assets, whether entire businesses, new technologies, or other innovations, is an integral part of the unique development process the Company employs to create value and drive long-term growth.


Three-Stage Development for Exponential Growth
 
For each acquisition completed, subject to market and other restrictions, there is a three-stage development process applied to maximize value creation and provide the engine for growth through increased bandwidth, horsepower, and scale. The first stage of this process begins with the asset acquisition itself, where we identify and acquire the right vehicles and asset structures, as well as the organizations and people capable of building revenue and scaling operations. The second stage of our development process focuses on revenue generation, creating revenue streams, license streams, and other reoccurring, scalable revenue. We seek to build highly functional businesses during this stage of development, businesses that we transform into well-oiled machines built for efficiency and operational excellence. As evidenced by the revenue growth mentioned earlier, the Company has delivered well on this stage in 2022. And as we continue to grow revenue, we enter the third and final stage of development where the focus turns toward positive EBITDA and profitability driven by scale and efficiencies. While each of our business lines are in various stages of this development process, ultimately as we reach our internal goals and expectations and these businesses reach an optimal point for the most effective leverage, we intend to pursue IPOs that enable us to share our success with our shareholders. As a holder of DSS Common Stock, you will receive a dividend of four Impact BioMedical Shares for every share of DSS Common Stock you hold. Giving back to our shareholders in this way has been part of our vision since the beginning days of our transformation, and we could potentially see two or even three such IPOs over the next 12 months. We believe our decentralized sharing model, the culmination of our three-stage development process, is unique and will drive shareholder value as we distribute dividends from these potential IPOs, directly benefiting each of our shareholders.


New Capacity Added to Consumer Packaging Business
 
Our Premier Packaging Corporation, Inc. (“Premier”) subsidiary provides a clear example of the second stage of our development process as it began operations at its new 105,000 sq. ft. facility in Western New York in the first half of 2022. The increased production capacity at the new facility, which has enabled us to meet growing customer demand, was a key driver behind our nearly 15% year-over-year revenue growth for this segment in the most recently reported quarter.
 
For over 25 years, Premier has been a market leader in providing solutions for paperboard packaging from consumer retail packaging and heavy mailing envelopes, to sophisticated custom and sustainable folding cartons and complex three-dimensional direct to customer packaging solutions. Premier’s innovative products and design team delivers packaging that provides functionality, marketability, and sustainability, with its fiber-based packing solutions, providing an alternative to traditional plastic packaging.
 
Since 2019, we have accelerated the transformation of Premier’s operations, investing in state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment, people, and processes to increase its capacity, improve quality and delivery, and to ensure it has the resources to support its growing customer base and their evolving supply chain demands. Utilizing these investments, we design and manufacture folding cartons that attract the consumer’s attention when and where it matters most at the point of sale.
 
We will continue to add capabilities in key areas that increase operational efficiencies to strengthen Premier’s foundation and offerings while continuing to provide world-class service to our customers.

Licensing Agreements Add Value to Impact BioMedical Ahead of Planned IPO
 
Impact BioMedical, the cornerstone of our BioHealth group, continued to progress on multiple fronts in 2022, including promising early testing results on new bioplastics, strengthened intellectual property protections, and licensing agreements with ProPhase Biopharma, a wholly owned subsidiary of ProPhase Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: PRPH), for its proprietary Linebacker and Equivir compounds. ProPhase Labs, a diversified diagnostic company with over three decades of enhancing wellness and improving health with OTC and prescription products, believes Impact BioMedical’s Linebacker compounds have multi-billion-dollar potential as cancer co-therapies and expects to commercialize Equivir as an OTC supplement in late 2023. Additionally, ProPhase BioPharma expects to file an IND with the US FDA for Equivir G as a prescription antiviral.
 
With a strengthened foundation now in place, we expect Impact BioMedical to provide us with the first opportunity to clearly demonstrate a core tenant of our vision – sharing our success with our shareholders. Although the uniqueness of our planned dividend strategy has required overcoming numerous regulatory challenges that have delayed the planned spinoff of Impact BioMedical, we anticipate we could receive the long-awaited approval to move forward with the first tranche of the dividend in early 2023.
 
Importantly, Impact BioMedical is just one of multiple assets we believe can have liquidity events in 2023 as we continue to diligently move our growing portfolio of businesses through our unique and strategic value creation process.


Double-Digit Portfolio Growth for American Medical REIT’s High-Quality Healthcare Assets 
 
We’ve expanded our medical real estate operations to more than 380,000 sq. ft. of high-quality healthcare assets across the US, providing a formidable foundation for our operations as we seek to further accelerate growth and build long-term value for our shareholders.
 
This attractive business line operates as American Medical REIT (AMRE), a subsidiary of our DSS Securities division, and acquired its first properties in 2021. It’s now generating average yields of approximately eight percent, and we have a massive pipeline of opportunities to further grow AMRE in the quarters ahead.
 
While other areas within commercial real estate have been impacted by the ongoing effects from the pandemic and changing interest rate environments, medical real estate has demonstrated considerable resiliency and demand. We are in a great position to further pursue opportunities to expand our medical REIT business line as we continue to execute our strategic growth plans.


High-Quality Loan Portfolio Generating 10.6% Average Return
 
The expansion of our medical real estate holdings is in part supported by our banking and financing business line, primarily through our majority-owned American Pacific Bancorp, Inc. (“APB”) subsidiary. APB issued more than $40 million in new loans since our third quarter 2021 acquisition, assembling a diversified portfolio of strong credit quality that is generating an average 10.6% return. Looking ahead, as the Company prepares to file an S-1 for APB’s IPO, we expect to expand our managed loan portfolio, which earns 1.25% annually in service charges, to more than $63 million. Importantly, the equity portfolio as a bank holding company is anticipated to remain relatively stable, regardless of stock market fluctuations.
USX Holdings to Launch Innovative Marketplace for Trading Digital Assets
 
In the near-term, the Company anticipates new developments from the 70% ownership of USX Holdings Company Inc. (“USX Holdings”), a collaboration with GSX Group Limited, a global digital exchange ecosystem for the issuance, trading, and settlement of tokenized securities, and Coinstreet Partners, a global decentralized digital investment banking group and digital asset financial service firm.


The Company is taking the necessary steps to prepare USX Holdings to launch an innovative marketplace for trading digital ADRs based on US equity securities. The transformative potential of digital securities is extremely exciting, and the Company believes USX Holdings can be a major player in the space as it pursues the massive opportunity in the US for a secondary market in securities tokens.
 
USX Holdings is part of our larger securities business line. In addition to the investment made in USX Holdings in 2021, the Company also completed strategic investments in broker dealers WestPark Capital and Sentinel Brokers and formed Liquid Value Asset Management Limited, a proprietary algorithmic trading firm majority owned by our wholly owned subsidiary, DSS Financial Management, Inc. As the Company moves into 2023, the Company plans to add market making to our securities business line and to pursue additional initiatives to drive further strong growth.

DSS PureAir Positioned for Global Rollout
 
DSS expects the foundation laid for our DSS PureAir, Inc. (“DSS PureAir”) business, first launched in mid-2021, to gain significant new traction across the Asia Pacific region in the quarters ahead. The primary assets of DSS PureAir include the investment in the Celios air purification system, Puradigm air purification product distribution license, and an array of other healthcare-related product licenses. With a growing portfolio of solutions, this division will continue to generate sales for the innovative proactive air and surface purifications solutions through the Company’s expanding direct selling business.
 
Rapidly Expanding Direct Selling Business Line
 
The December 2021 investment in Sharing Services Global gave DSS controlling interest with nearly 59 percent ownership of the established direct selling business. The SHRG platform leverages the capabilities and expertise of various companies that market and sell products direct to the consumer and generated nearly $18.9 million in revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.
Key Upcoming Milestone for AmericaFirst Quantitative Funds
 
AmericaFirst Quantitative Funds, part of our Securities and Investment Management segment, continued to generate net asset inflows in 2022 despite the negative market environment, thanks to a combination of peer-group outperformance and great marketing by our team.
Looking Ahead
 
With operations around the world, DSS has a unique visibility of global economic conditions, and based on the view of the increasing likelihood of recession, the Company has shifted our near-term focus toward cost cutting initiatives and preserving cash while maintaining preparations for potential significant liquidity events in 2023. DSS will take advantage of the strong performing assets, and, alongside these efforts, will continue to apply the three-stage value creation process across the diversified portfolio of holdings.
 
Overall, the Company has tremendous confidence in the future of DSS, and believes the best days are ahead. The Company remains steadfastly committed to new value creation and has laid the necessary foundation for years of future success.
 
The successes the Company has experienced over the past year and the growth opportunities anticipated for 2023 and beyond have been made possible by the diligent efforts of the team and the support of the shareholders.

Customers
 
Product Packaging: During 2022, one customer accounted for approximately 14% of our consolidated revenue. Customer diversification improvements have produced several new customers to our overall customer base and will continue to do so in 2023.


Commercial Lending: During 2022, American Pacific Bancorp, Inc. has issued a little over $3 million in new loans to customers with strong credit quality across a diverse portfolio of businesses. We anticipate another $10M+ of new commercial loans in the near term.
 
Direct Marketing: During 2022 our direct marketing companies HWH World, HWH World Holdings, SHRG, and its subsidiary, The Happy Co. continued to build their customer bases and brand recognition on a global basis.

Raw Materials
 
Product Packaging: The primary raw materials the Company uses in its businesses are paper, paperboard, corrugated board and ink. The Company negotiates with leading suppliers to maximize its purchasing efficiencies and uses a wide variety of paper grades, formats, ink formulations and colors. Paper and paperboard prices continued to increase in 2022, and we believe increases in future years are expected. Except for certain packaging customers where the Company enters into annual contracts, for which changes in paperboard pricing is absorbed by the Company, the Company has historically passed substantially all increases and decreases to its customers, although there can be no assurances that the Company will continue to do so in the future.
 
Direct Marketing: Sources its products from 3rd party suppliers for nutritional, performance, and health and beauty product ingredients. We rely on our extensive supplier network for availability of an extensive range of vitamins, minerals, botanicals, plant and herb extracts, as well as nutritional supplements. We are expecting continue price pressure and supply chain issues into 2023 and have put significant risk mitigation strategies in place to avoid dramatic P&L effects based on this anticipated and continued volatility. The company passes any substantial increase of its raw materials or finished goods on to its customers to limit any significant margin impact.
 
Environmental Compliance
 
It is the Company’s policy to conduct its operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and other requirements. While it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Government Regulation
 
Our biotechnology business is faced with potential government regulations. If new legislation, regulations, or rules are implemented either by Congress, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”), or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our patent monetization efforts and, in turn, our assets, expenses and revenue. United States patent laws have been amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. The America Invents Act includes several significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual parties allegedly infringing by their respective individual actions or activities. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities, such as our Company, on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could adversely impact our ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies.
 
Moreover, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions.

Today, we have approximately 40 subsidiaries operating across nine attractive market business lines, with five of those business lines now with significant operations and generating revenue.


We have been fortunate to have attracted tremendous talent to lead each of our business units. When building out our businesses, we look for established, industry leaders with long track records and the expertise to add meaningful value to our DSS ecosystem and create a foundation for success.
 
Our diverse book of clients and investments has given us strong competitive advantages globally in many industries; we intend to aggressively capitalize on these advantages moving forward. We believe the momentum of our success and ongoing evolution will continue to be unabated in 2023 we will create the catalyst for new value creation in the coming year and beyond.
