(1) | Excludes six owned and one leased-in offshore support vessels retired and removed from service as of December 31, 2018. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | As of December 31, 2018, 53 of the Company's owned and leased-in vessels were outfitted with dynamic positioning ("DP") systems. DP systems enable vessels to maintain a fixed position in close proximity to a rig or platform. The most technologically advanced DP systems have enhanced redundancy in the vessel's power, electrical, computer and reference systems enabling vessels to maintain accurate position-keeping even in the event of failure of one of those systems ("DP-2") and, in some cases, in the event of fire and flood ("DP-3").

 
Anchor handling towing supply ("AHTS") vessels are used primarily to support offshore drilling activities by towing, positioning and mooring drilling rigs and other marine equipment. AHTS vessels are also used to carry and launch equipment such as remote operated vehicles ("ROVs") used underwater in drilling and well installation, maintenance, and repair and transport supplies and equipment from shore bases to offshore drilling rigs, platforms and other installations, including windfarm installations. The defining characteristics of AHTS vessels are: (i) horsepower ("bhp"); (ii) bollard pull, which is the pulling capacity of the AHTS vessel and is important for towing and positioning rigs; (iii) size of winch in terms of "line pull;" and (iv) wire storage capacity. The Company's fleet of AHTS vessels has varying capabilities and supports offshore mooring activities in water depths ranging from 300 to 8,000 feet. Most modern AHTS vessels are equipped with DP systems and can also carry drilling fluids and cement below-deck. As of December 31, 2018, 10 of the 12 owned and leased-in AHTS vessels were equipped with DP-2 and two were equipped with DP-1.
 
Fast support vessels ("FSVs") are lightweight, aluminum hull vessels used primarily to move cargo and personnel to and from offshore drilling rigs, platforms and other installations at greater speeds than traditional steel hull support vessels. FSVs can be catamaran or mono-hull vessels ranging from 130 to 210 feet in length and capable of speeds between 20 to 45 knots with capacities to carry special cargo, support both drilling operations and production services and transport passengers. FSVs built within the last ten years are sometimes equipped with DP-2 systems, firefighting equipment and ride control systems for greater comfort and performance. As of December 31, 2018, 22 of the 33 owned and leased-in FSVs were equipped with DP-2, five were equipped with DP-1, and two were equipped with DP-3. The Company's FSV fleet includes vessels that have a passenger capacity of 36 to 150 and, on certain newer FSVs, include reclining seating, ambient lighting and other features to enhance comfort and marketability for passenger transport.

Supply vessels generally range from 190 to more than 300 feet in length and are primarily used to deliver cargo such as drilling fluids, liquid mud, methanol, diesel fuel and water to rigs and platforms where drilling and work-over activity is underway. These vessels are capable of being modified for a wide variety of other uses and missions, including, but not limited to, construction support typically when fitted with a crane, standby, security, firefighting, accommodation, and limited towing and anchor handling when fitted with a winch. Relevant differentiating features of supply vessels are total carrying capacity (expressed as deadweight: "dwt"), available area of clear deck space, below-deck capacity for storage of mud and cement used in the drilling process, tank storage for water and fuel oil, fuel efficiency and accommodation capacity. Additional factors in the commercial marketability of supply vessels are operating draft because certain markets are limited in the size of vessel that can work safely, local flag preference, cabotage requirements and regulations. To improve station keeping ability, many modern supply vessels have DP systems capabilities. As of December 31, 2018, six of the seven owned supply vessels were equipped with DP-2.
 
Standby safety vessels typically remain on location proximate to offshore rigs and production facilities to respond to emergencies. These vessels carry special equipment to rescue personnel and are equipped to provide first aid and shelter. These vessels sometimes perform a dual role, also functioning as supply vessels.
 
Specialty vessels include anchor handling tugs, accommodation, line handling and other vessels. These vessels generally have specialized features adapting them to specific applications including offshore maintenance and construction services, freight hauling services and accommodation services.
Liftboats provide a self-propelled, stable platform to perform production platform construction, inspection, maintenance and removal, well intervention and work-over, well production enhancement, well plug and abandonment, pipeline installation and maintenance and diving operations. The length of jacking legs (200 feet to 335 feet for the Company's liftboats) determines the water depth in which these vessels can work. Other differentiating features are crane lifting capacity and reach, clear deck area, electrical generating power and accommodation capacity. Liftboats are used primarily in domestic and international markets including the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, Mexico and the Middle East. As of December 31, 2018, three of the 19 owned and leased-in liftboats were equipped with DP-2 and one liftboat with DP-1.
 
Crew transfer vessels (referred to as windfarm utility vessels in the Company's prior public filings) are used primarily to move personnel and supplies to offshore wind farms. There are two main types of the Company's vessels; Windcats and Windspeeds. The Windcat series feature a catamaran hull with flush foredeck, providing a stable platform from which personnel can safely transfer to turbine towers, and are capable of speeds between 25 and 31 knots. The Windspeed series are rapid response vessels with a maximum speed of 38 knots, which are used for light work during the construction and operational periods of offshore wind farms. All of the Company's crew transfer vessels have been built since 2005.
 
In addition to its existing fleet, the Company has new construction projects in progress, as of December 31, 2018, for 12 offshore support vessels, including
 

• | two U.S.-flag, DP-2 FSVs scheduled for delivery between the first quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | two U.S.-flag, DP-2 FSVs with uncertain delivery dates as the Company, at its option, may defer their construction for an indefinite period of time;
• | three U.S.-flag, DP-2 supply vessels scheduled for delivery between the first quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020; 
• | two foreign-flag, crew transfer vessels scheduled for delivery between the first and second quarters of 2019; and 
• | three foreign-flag, platform supply vessels ("PSVs") scheduled for delivery between the third quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020. 

 
The Company's new U.S.-built equipment will meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") Tier III environmental regulations with respect to nitrous oxide ("NOx") emissions from marine diesel engines. Vessels whose keel was laid after January 1, 2016 will have to meet EPA Tier IV environmental regulations, which the Company believes will add significant expense to the new construction of offshore support vessels and may possibly be beyond current design capabilities.

Markets
 
The Company operates its fleet in five principal geographic regions: the United States, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico; Africa, primarily in West Africa; the Middle East and Asia; Brazil, Mexico, Central and South America; and Europe, primarily in the North Sea. The Company's vessels are highly mobile and regularly and routinely move between countries within a geographic region. In addition, the Company's vessels are redeployed among its geographic regions, subject to flag restrictions, as changes in market conditions dictate.
 
The table below sets forth vessel types by geographic market as of December 31 for the indicated years. The Company sometimes participates in joint venture arrangements in certain geographical locations in order to enhance marketing capabilities and facilitate operations in certain foreign markets allowing for the expansion of its fleet and operations while diversifying risks and reducing capital outlays associated with such expansion.

United States, primarily U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As of December 31, 2018, 35 vessels were located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including 25 owned, five leased-in, three joint-ventured and two managed. The Company's vessels in this market support deepwater anchor handling, fast cargo transport, general cargo transport, well intervention, work-over, decommissioning and diving operations.
 
Africa, primarily West Africa. As of December 31, 2018, 18 vessels were located in West Africa, including 13 owned, two leased-in, two joint-ventured and one managed. The Company's vessels in this area generally support projects for major oil companies, primarily in Angola. 
Middle East and Asia. As of December 31, 2018, 30 vessels were located in the Middle East and Asia, including 22 owned, four joint-ventured and four managed. The Company's vessels in this area generally support exploration, personnel transport and seasonal construction activities in Egypt, Israel, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and countries along the Arabian Gulf and Arabian Sea, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
Brazil, Mexico, Central and South America. As of December 31, 2018, 34 vessels were located in this region, including seven owned and 27 joint-ventured through the Company's 49% noncontrolling interest in Mantenimiento Express Maritimo, S.A.P.I. de C.V. ("MexMar") and through a subsidiary of the Company's 49% noncontrolling interest in MEXMAR Offshore International LLC ("MEXMAR Offshore"). These vessels, consisting of a fleet of FSVs, supply, specialty and liftboat vessels, provide support for exploration and production activities in Mexico, Brazil and Guyana. From time to time, the Company's vessels work in Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia and Venezuela.
Europe, primarily North Sea. As of December 31, 2018, 22 non-wind farm related vessels were located in Europe providing standby safety and supply services, including 18 owned and four joint-ventured. Demand for standby services developed in 1991 after the United Kingdom passed legislation requiring offshore operators to maintain higher specification standby safety vessels. The legislation requires a vessel to "stand by" to provide a means of evacuation and rescue for platform and rig personnel in the event of an emergency at an offshore installation. In addition, 40 vessels were located in this region supporting the construction and maintenance of offshore wind turbines, including 36 owned and four joint ventured.

Seasonality
 
The demand for the Company's fleet can fluctuate with weather conditions because maintenance, construction and decommissioning activities are planned during times of the year with more favorable weather conditions. Seasonality is most pronounced for the liftboat fleet in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, offshore support vessels in the Middle East and crew transfer vessels in the North Sea, with peak demand normally occurring during the summer months. As a consequence of this seasonality, the Company typically schedules drydockings or other repair and maintenance activity during the winter months.
Customers and Contractual Arrangements
 
The Company's principal customers are major integrated national and international oil companies, independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, as well as wind farm operations and installation and maintenance companies. Consolidation of oil and natural gas companies through mergers and acquisitions over the past several years has reduced the Company's customer base. This, together with the depressed oil and gas price environment that began in 2014 has negatively affected exploration, field development and production activity as consolidated companies generally focus, at least initially, on increasing efficiency and reducing costs and delay or abandon exploration activity and facilities with less promise. During the year ended December 31, 2018, one customer, Perenco UK Limited, was responsible for 10% or more of the Company's consolidated operating revenues. The Company's ten largest customers accounted for approximately 47% of its operating revenues in 2018. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 
The Company earns revenues primarily from the time charter and bareboat charter of vessels to customers based upon daily rates of hire. Therefore, vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period. Under a time charter, the Company provides a vessel to a customer and is responsible for all operating expenses, typically excluding fuel. Under a bareboat charter, the Company provides a vessel to a customer and the customer assumes responsibility for all operating expenses and all risk of operation. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, time charter durations and rates are typically established in the context of master service agreements that govern the terms and conditions of the charter. From time to time, the Company may also participate in pooling arrangements whereby the time charter revenues of certain of the Company's vessels are shared with the time charter revenues of certain vessels of similar type owned by non-affiliated vessel owners based upon an agreed formula.
 
Contract or charter durations may range from several days to several years. Longer duration charters are more common where equipment is not as readily available or specific equipment is required. In the North Sea, multi-year charters have been more common and constitute a significant portion of that market. Time charters in Asia have historically been less common and generally contracts or charters have terms of less than two years. In the Company's other operating areas, charters vary in length from short-term to multi-year periods, many with cancellation clauses and no early termination penalty. As a result of options and frequent renewals, the stated duration of charters may have little correlation with the length of time the vessel is actually contracted to provide services to a particular customer.
 
Competitive Conditions
 
The market for offshore marine services is highly fragmented and competitive depending upon the region of operation. The most important competitive factors are pricing, availability and specifications of equipment to fit customer requirements. Other important factors include service, reputation, flag preference, local marine operating conditions, the ability to provide and maintain logistical support given the complexity of a project and the cost of moving equipment from one geographic region to another.
 
The Company has numerous competitors in each of the geographic regions in which it operates, ranging from international companies that operate in many regions to smaller local companies that typically concentrate their activities in one specific region.
 
Risks of Foreign Operations
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, 79%, 87% and 85%, respectively, of the Company's operating revenues and $(1.3) million, $1.9 million, and $(4.2) million, respectively, of the Company's equity in earnings (losses) from 50% or less owned companies, net of tax, were derived from its foreign operations.
 
Foreign operations are subject to inherent risks, which, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or growth prospects. See the risk factors regarding international operations in "Item 1A. Risk Factors."
 
 5


Government Regulation
 
The Company's ownership, operation, construction and staffing of vessels is subject to significant regulation under various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations and pursuant to international conventions, including international conventions and ship registry laws of the nations under which the Company's vessels are flagged, especially with respect to regulatory matters, health, safety and environmental protection and vessel and port security.
Regulatory Matters
 
Domestically registered vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard ("USCG"), the National Transportation Safety Board ("NTSB"), the U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP"), EPA and the U.S. Maritime Administration, as well as in certain instances applicable state and local laws. The Company's operations may, from time to time, also fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") and its Safety and Environmental Management System regulations, and the Company must also periodically certify that its maritime operations adhere to those regulations. These agencies and organizations establish safety requirements and standards and are authorized to investigate vessels and accidents and to recommend improved maritime safety standards.
 
The Company is subject to regulation under the Jones Act and related U.S. cabotage laws, which restrict ownership and operation of vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade (i.e., trade between points in the United States), including the transportation of cargo. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be built in the United States, registered under the U.S.-flag, manned by predominantly U.S. crews, and be owned and operated by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. Violation of the Jones Act could prohibit operation of vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade during the period of such non-compliance, result in material fines and subject Company vessels to seizure and forfeiture.
 
To facilitate compliance with the Jones Act, the Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated By-Laws: (i) limit the aggregate percentage ownership by non-U.S. citizens of any class of the Company's capital stock (including Common Stock) to 22.5% of the outstanding shares of each such class to ensure that ownership by non-U.S. citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by applicable maritime law (presently 25%) but authorize the Company's Board of Directors, under certain circumstances, to increase the foregoing percentage to 24%; (ii) require institution of a dual stock certification system to help determine such ownership; (iii) provide that any issuance or transfer of shares in excess of such permitted percentage shall be ineffective as against the Company and that neither the Company nor its transfer agent shall register such purported issuance or transfer of shares or be required to recognize the purported transferee or owner as a stockholder of the Company for any purpose whatsoever except to exercise its remedies; (iv) provide that any such excess shares shall not have any voting or dividend rights; (v) permit the Company to redeem any such excess shares; and (vi) permit the Board of Directors to make such reasonable determinations as may be necessary to ascertain such ownership and implement such limitations. In addition, the Company's Second Amended and Restated By-Laws limit the number of non-U.S. citizens that may serve as directors and restrict any non-U.S. citizen officer from acting in the absence or disability of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President.  For more information, see the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated By-Laws.
 
The Company operates vessels that are registered in the United States as well as in a number of foreign jurisdictions. Vessels are subject to the laws of the applicable jurisdiction as to ownership, registration, manning, environmental protection and safety. Vessels operated as standby safety vessels in the North Sea are subject to the requirements of the Department of Transport of the United Kingdom pursuant to the United Kingdom Safety Act. In addition, the Company's vessels are subject to the requirements of a number of international conventions, as amended, that are applicable to vessels depending on their jurisdiction of registration. Among the more significant of these conventions are: (i) the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto ("MARPOL"); (ii) the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 and 1978 Protocols ("SOLAS"); and (iii) the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers ("STCW").
 
The Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (the "MLC") establishes comprehensive minimum requirements for working conditions of seafarers including, among other things, conditions of employment, hours of work and rest, grievance and complaints procedures, accommodations, recreational facilities, food and catering, health protection, medical care, welfare, and social security protection. The MLC defines seafarer to include all persons engaged in work on a vessel in addition to the vessel's crew. Under this MLC definition, the Company may be responsible for proving that customer and contractor personnel aboard its vessels have contracts of employment that comply with the MLC requirements. The Company could also be responsible for salaries and/or benefits of third-parties that may board one of its vessels. The MLC requires certain vessels that engage in international trade to maintain a valid Maritime Labour Certificate issued by their flag administration. Although the United States is not a party to the MLC, U.S.-flag vessels operating internationally must comply with the MLC when visiting a port in a country that is a party to the MLC. The Company has developed and implemented a fleetwide plan designed to comply with the MLC to the extent applicable to its vessels.
 
The hull and machinery of most commercial vessels are classed by an international classification society authorized by its country of registry and subject to survey and inspection by shipping regulatory bodies. The international classification society certifies that a vessel is maintained in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the United Nations Safety of Life at Sea Conventions. Certain of the Company's vessels are subject to the periodic inspection, survey, drydocking and maintenance requirements of the USCG, the American Bureau of Shipping and other marine classification societies.
 
Under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, the Company's U.S.-flagged vessels will be subject to repositioning by the U.S. Government under certain terms and conditions during a national emergency as described further in the risk factor under the heading "The Company's U.S.-flag vessels are subject to requisition for ownership or use by the United States in case of national emergency or national defense need" under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
In addition to the USCG, the EPA, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety, the BSEE and certain individual U.S. states regulate vessels and other structures in accordance with the requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA 90") or analogous state law. There is currently little uniformity among the regulations issued by these agencies, which increases the Company's compliance costs and risk of non-compliance.
 
Although the Company faces some risk when responding to third-party oil spills, a responder engaged in emergency and crisis activities has immunity from liability under U.S. federal law and all U.S. coastal state laws for any spills arising from its response efforts, except in the event of death or personal injury or as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company may also have derivative immunity when working under the orders of a Federal On Scene Coordinator.

Environmental Compliance
 
The Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local and international environmental and safety laws and regulations and to comprehensive international conventions, including laws and regulations related to the discharge of oil and pollutants into waters regulated thereunder. Violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions, or other sanctions.
 
The Company does not expect that it will be required to make capital expenditures in the near future to comply with environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows or growth prospects; however, because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly strict requirements, the Company cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these laws and regulations.
 
OPA 90 establishes a regulatory and liability regime for the protection of the environment from oil spills. OPA 90 applies to owners and operators of facilities operating near navigable waters of the United States and owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels operating in U.S. waters, which include the navigable waters of the United States and the 200-mile exclusive economic zone around the United States (the "EEZ"). For purposes of its liability limits and financial responsibility and response planning requirements, OPA 90 differentiates between tank vessels (such as chemical and petroleum product vessels and liquid tank barges) and "other vessels" (such as the Company's offshore support vessels).
 
Under OPA 90, owners and operators of regulated facilities and owners and operators or bareboat charterers of vessels are "responsible parties" and may be jointly, severally and strictly liable for removal costs and damages arising from facility and vessel oil spills or threatened spills up to certain limits of liability as discussed below. Damages are defined broadly to include: (i) injury to natural resources and the costs of remediation thereof; (ii) injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property; (iii) net loss by various governmental bodies, of taxes, royalties, rents, fees and profits; (iv) lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to property or natural resources damage; (v) net costs of providing increased or additional public services necessitated by a spill response, such as protection from fire or other hazards or taking additional safety precautions; and (vi) loss of subsistence use of available natural resources.
 
OPA 90 limits liability for responsible parties for non-tank vessels, such as the Company's, to the greater of $1,100 per gross ton or $939,800. These liability limits do not apply (a) if an incident is caused by the responsible party's violation of federal safety, construction or operating regulations or by the responsible party's gross negligence or willful misconduct, (b) if the responsible party fails to report the incident or to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection with oil removal activities as required by a responsible official or (c) if the responsible party fails to comply with an order issued under OPA 90.
 
OPA 90 requires vessel owners and operators to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of insurance or qualification as a self-insurer or other evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet their potential liabilities under OPA 90. The Company has satisfied USCG regulations by providing evidence of financial responsibility demonstrated by commercial insurance and self-insurance. OPA 90 regulations also implement the financial responsibility requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), which imposes liability for any discharge of hazardous substances, similar to OPA 90, and provides compensation for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages. Liability per vessel under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5 million, unless the incident is caused by gross negligence, willful misconduct, or a violation of certain regulations, in which case liability is unlimited.
 
Under the Nontank Vessel Response Plan Final Rule, owners and operators of nontank vessels are required to prepare Nontank Vessel Response Plans. The Company expects its current pollution liability insurance to cover spill removal costs, subject to coverage deductibles and limitations, including a cap of $1.0 billion. There could be a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or growth prospects if the Company incurs spill liability under circumstances in which the insurance carrier fails or refuses to provide coverage or the loss exceeds the Company's coverage limitations.
 
MARPOL is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by vessels from operational or accidental discharges. It is implemented in the United States pursuant to the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. Since the 1990s, the Department of Justice ("DOJ") has been aggressively enforcing U.S. criminal laws against vessel owners, operators, managers, crew members, shore side personnel, and corporate officers related to violations of MARPOL. Violations have related to pollution prevention devices, such as the oily-water separator, and include falsifying records, obstructing justice, and making false statements. In certain cases, responsible shipboard officers and shoreside officials have been sentenced to prison. In addition, the DOJ has required most defendants to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance plan ("ECP") or risk losing the ability to trade in U.S. waters. If the Company is subjected to a DOJ prosecution, it could suffer significant adverse effects, including substantial criminal penalties and defense costs, reputation damages and costs associated with the implementation of an ECP.

The Clean Water Act ("CWA") prohibits the discharge of "pollutants" into the navigable waters of the United States. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances, into navigable waters of the United States and the EEZ around the United States and imposes civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges, thereby exposing the Company to liability that is in addition to liability arising under OPA 90 and CERCLA.
 
The CWA also established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permitting program, which governs discharges of pollutants into navigable waters of the United States. Pursuant to the NPDES permitting program, the EPA has issued Vessel General Permits covering discharges incidental to normal vessel operations. The EPA issued the 2013 Vessel General Permit (“2013 VGP”) on April 12, 2013 with an effective five-year period of December 19, 2013 to December 18, 2018.  In light of the legislation described below, the 2013 VGP continues to apply to U.S.-flag and foreign-flag commercial vessels that are at least 79 feet in length and operate within the three-mile territorial sea of the United States. The 2013 VGP requires vessel owners and operators to adhere to "best management practices" to manage the covered discharges that occur normally in the operation of a vessel, including ballast water, and implements various training, inspection, monitoring, record keeping, and reporting requirements, as well as corrective actions upon identification of deficiencies. The Company has filed a Notice of Intent to be covered by the 2013 VGP for each of its ships that operate in U.S. waters.
 
On December 4, 2018, the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”) was enacted, establishing a new framework for the regulation of discharges incidental to the normal operations of vessels.  VIDA requires the EPA to develop performance standards for such discharges within two years of its enactment and requires the USCG to develop implementation, compliance, and enforcement regulations within two years of EPA’s promulgation of standards. VIDA extends the 2013 VGP’s provisions, leaving them in effect until new regulations are final and enforceable.  Non-military, non-recreational vessels greater than 79 feet in length must continue to comply with the requirements of the 2013 VGP, including submission of annual reports. The Company can provide no assurance as to when the new regulations and performance standards will be issued, nor can it predict what additional costs it may incur to comply with any such new regulations and performance standards.
 
Many countries have ratified and are thus subject to the liability scheme adopted by the International Maritime Organization (the "IMO") and set out in the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969 (the "1969 Convention"). Some of these countries have also adopted the 1992 Protocol to the 1969 Convention (the "1992 Protocol"). Under both the 1969 Convention and the 1992 Protocol, a vessel's registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil from ships carrying oil in bulk as cargo, subject to certain complete defenses. These conventions also limit the liability of the shipowner under certain circumstances, provided the discharge was not caused by the shipowner's actual fault or intentional or reckless misconduct.
 
Vessels trading to countries that are parties to these conventions must provide evidence of insurance covering the liability of the owner. The Company believes that its Protection and Indemnity ("P&I") insurance will cover any liability under these conventions, subject to applicable policy deductibles, exclusions and limitations.
 
The United States is not a party to the 1969 Convention or the 1992 Protocol, and thus OPA 90, CERCLA, CWA and other federal and state laws apply in the United States as discussed above. In other jurisdictions where the 1969 Convention has not been adopted, various legislative and regulatory schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to that convention.
 
The International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, 2001, was adopted to ensure that adequate, prompt and effective compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by spills of oil when used as fuel by vessels. The convention applies to damage caused to the territory, including the territorial sea, and in the EEZs, of the countries that are party to it. Although the United States has not ratified this convention, U.S.-flag vessels operating internationally would be subject to it if they sail within the territories of those countries that have implemented its provisions. The Company believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
 
The National Invasive Species Act ("NISA") was enacted in the United States in 1996 in response to growing reports of harmful organisms being released into U.S. waters through ballast water taken on by vessels in foreign ports. The USCG adopted regulations under NISA that impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering U.S. waters. All new vessels constructed on or after December 1, 2013, regardless of ballast water capacity, must comply with these requirements on delivery from the shipyard absent an extension from the USCG. For non-exempt vessels, ballast water treatment equipment may be required to be used on the vessel. In response to these requirements, the Company's ships operating in the United States waters currently use water from U.S. public systems. Some U.S. states have enacted legislation or regulations to address the introduction of invasive species through ballast water and hull cleaning management, and permitting requirements, which in many cases have also become part of the state's 2013 VGP certification. Other states may proceed with the enactment of similar requirements that could increase the Company's costs of operating in state waters.
 
The IMO ratified the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments, otherwise known as the Ballast Water Management Convention (the "BWM Convention"), which entered into force on September 8, 2017. Under the BWM Convention, all ships in international traffic are required to manage their ballast water and sediments under a ship-specific ballast water management plan. The United States is not a party to the BWM Convention, but vessels that undertake international voyages may have to install an IMO approved ballast water treatment system or use one of the other management options under the BWM Convention to achieve compliance. In response to these requirements, the Company currently uses a BWM Convention-compliant ballast water management method of chemical disinfectant on its vessels operating outside the United States.
 
The Endangered Species Act, related regulations and comparable state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction. Protection may include restrictions on the speed of vessels in certain ocean waters and may require the Company to change the routes of vessels during particular periods.
 
The Clean Air Act (as amended, the "CAA") requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. The CAA also requires states to submit State Implementation Plans ("SIPs"), which are designed to attain national health-based air quality standards throughout the United States, including major metropolitan and/or industrial areas. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. The EPA and some U.S. states have each proposed more stringent regulations of air emissions from propulsion and auxiliary engines on oceangoing vessels.

MARPOL also addresses air emissions, including emissions of sulfur and nitrous oxide ("NOx"), from vessels, including a requirement to use low sulfur fuels worldwide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on vessels. Vessels worldwide are currently required to use fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 3.5%, which the IMO decided in October 2016 to reduce to 0.5% beginning in January 2020. As a result of this reduction, fuel costs for vessel operators could rise dramatically beginning in 2020, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects. MARPOL also imposes NOx emissions standards on installed marine diesel engines of over 130 kW output power other than those used solely for emergency purposes irrespective of the tonnage of the vessel into which such an engine is installed. The actual NOx limit is determined by a variety of factors, including the vessel's construction date, the rated speed of the vessel's engine, and the area in which the vessel is operating.
 
More stringent sulfur and NOx requirements apply in certain designated Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”). There are currently four ECAs worldwide: the Baltic Sea ECA, North Sea ECA, North American ECA, and U.S. Caribbean ECA. As of January 1, 2015, vessels operating in an ECA must burn fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 0.1%. Further, marine diesel engines on vessels constructed on or after January 1, 2016 that are operated in an ECA must meet the stringent NOx standards described above.
 
The Company's operations occasionally generate and require the transportation, treatment and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes that are subject in the United States to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") or comparable U.S. state, local or foreign requirements. From time to time the Company arranges for the disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances at offsite disposal facilities. The EPA has a longstanding policy that RCRA only applies after wastes are "purposely removed" from a vessel. As a general matter, with certain exceptions, vessel owners and operators are required to determine if their wastes are hazardous, obtain a generator identification number, comply with certain standards for the proper management of hazardous wastes, and use hazardous waste manifests for shipments to disposal facilities. Moreover, vessel owners and operators may be subject to more stringent U.S. state hazardous waste requirements. If such materials are improperly disposed of by third-parties with which the Company contracts, the Company may still be held liable for cleanup costs under applicable laws.
 
MARPOL also governs the discharge of garbage from ships. MARPOL defines certain sea areas, such as the "wider Caribbean region" as "special areas" requiring a higher level of protection than other areas of the sea.
 
Applicable MARPOL regulations provide for strict garbage management procedures and documentation requirements for all vessels and fixed and floating platforms. These regulations impose a general prohibition on the discharge of all garbage unless the discharge is expressly provided for under the regulations. The regulations have greatly reduced the amount of garbage that vessels are allowed to dispose of at sea and have increased the Company's costs of disposing garbage remaining on board vessels at their port calls.
 
Various international conventions and federal, state and local laws and regulations have been considered or implemented to address the environmental effects of emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The U.S. Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases. At United Nations climate change conferences over the past few decades, various countries have agreed to specific international accords or protocols to establish limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. In December 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted pursuant to which member parties agreed to implement national programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. At the 2015 United Nations climate change conference in Paris, various countries adopted the Paris Agreement, which seeks to reduce emissions in an effort to slow global warming. While the United States signed the Paris Agreement in 2016, it has subsequently taken steps to withdraw from the agreement. The Paris Agreement does not specifically mention shipping.
 
The IMO has announced its intention to develop limits on greenhouse gases from international shipping and is working on proposed mandatory technical and operational measures to achieve these limits. The first step toward this goal occurred in October 2016, when the IMO adopted a system for collecting data on ships' fuel-oil consumption, which will be mandatory and apply globally.
 
In June 2013, the European Commission proposed legislation and established a strategy for progressively integrating maritime emissions into the European Union's (the "E.U.") policy for reducing domestic greenhouse emissions. As of January 1, 2015, E.U. Member States have to ensure that ships in the Baltic, the North Sea and the English Channel are using fuels with a sulfur content of no more than 0.10%. In addition, the European Parliament and E.U. Council have adopted a series of regulations beginning with Regulation 2015/757, which became effective on July 1, 2015, that establish a system for monitoring, reporting and verifying emissions from vessels of 5,000 or more gross tons calling at E.U. ports. The first reporting period began on January 1, 2018.
 
In the United States, pursuant to an April 2007 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, the EPA was required to consider whether carbon dioxide should be considered a pollutant that endangers public health and welfare, and thus subject to regulation under the CAA. In October 2007, the California Attorney General and a coalition of environmental groups petitioned the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from oceangoing vessels under the CAA. On December 1, 2009, the EPA issued an "endangerment finding" regarding greenhouse gases under the CAA. To date, the regulations proposed and enacted by the EPA regarding carbon dioxide have not involved oceangoing vessels. Under MARPOL, vessels operating in designated ECAs are required to meet fuel sulfur limits and NOx emission limits, including the use of engines that meet the EPA standards for NOx emissions, as discussed above.
 
Any future adoption of climate control treaties, legislation or other regulatory measures by the United Nations, IMO, EU, United States or other countries where the Company operates that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could result in financial and operational impacts on the Company's business (including potential capital expenditures to reduce such emissions) that the Company cannot predict with certainty at this time. In addition, there may be significant physical effects of climate change from such emissions that have the potential to negatively impact the Company's customers, personnel, and physical assets, any of which could adversely impact cargo levels, the demand for the Company's services, or the Company's ability to recruit personnel.
 
The Company manages exposure to losses from the above-described laws through its development of appropriate risk management programs, including compliance programs, safety management systems and insurance programs. Although the Company believes these programs mitigate its legal risk, there can be no assurance that any future regulations or requirements or any discharge or emission of pollutants by the Company will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or growth prospects.

Security
 
In recent years, the USCG, the IMO, states and local ports have adopted heightened security procedures related to ports and vessels.
 
Specifically, on November 25, 2002, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 ("MTSA") was signed into law. To implement certain portions of MTSA, in July 2003, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Similarly, in December 2002, the IMO adopted amendments to SOLAS, known as the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (the "ISPS Code"), creating a new chapter dealing specifically with maritime security. The chapter imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities. Included in the various requirements under MTSA and/or the ISPS Code are the following:

• | onboard installation of automatic information systems to enhance vessel-to-vessel and vessel-to-shore communications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | onboard installation of ship security alert systems; 
• | the development of vessel and facility security plans; 
• | the implementation of a Transportation Worker Identification Credential program; and 
• | compliance with flag state security certification requirements. 

 
The USCG regulations, which are intended to align with international maritime security standards, generally deem foreign-flag vessels to be in compliance with MTSA vessel security measures provided such vessels have onboard a valid International Ship Security Certificate that attests to the vessel's compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code. However, U.S.-flag vessels that are engaged in international trade must comply with all of the security measures required by MTSA, as well as SOLAS and the ISPS Code.
 
In response to these new security programs, the Company has implemented security plans and procedures for each of its U.S.-flag vessels pursuant to rules implementing MTSA that have been issued by the USCG.
 
The International Safety Management Code ("ISM Code"), adopted by the IMO as an amendment to SOLAS, provides international standards for the safe management and operation of ships and for the prevention of marine pollution from ships. The United States enforces the ISM Code for all U.S.-flag vessels and those foreign-flag vessels that call at U.S. ports. All of the Company's vessels that are 500 or more gross tons are required to be certified under the standards set forth in the ISM Code's safety and pollution protocols. The Company also voluntarily complies with these protocols for some vessels that are under the mandatory 500-gross ton threshold. Under the ISM Code, vessel operators are required to develop an extensive safety management system ("SMS") that includes, among other things, the adoption of a written system of safety and environmental protection policies setting forth instructions and procedures for operating their vessels subject to the ISM Code and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. The Company has developed such a safety management system. These SMS policies apply to both the vessel and shore-side personnel and are vessel specific. The ISM Code also requires a Document of Compliance ("DOC") to be obtained for the vessel manager and a Safety Management Certificate ("SMC") to be obtained for each vessel subject to the ISM Code that it operates or manages. The Company has obtained DOCs for its shore side offices that have responsibility for vessel management and SMCs for each of the vessels that such offices operate or manage.
 
Noncompliance with the ISM Code and other IMO regulations may subject the shipowner or charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. For example, the USCG authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code will be prohibited from utilizing U.S. ports.
 
Industry Hazards and Insurance
 
Vessel operations involve inherent risks associated with carrying large volumes of cargo and rendering services in a marine environment. Hazards include adverse weather conditions, collisions, fire and mechanical failures, which may result in death or injury to personnel, damage to equipment, loss of operating revenues, contamination of cargo, pollution and other environmental damages and increased costs. The Company maintains hull, liability and war risk, general liability, workers compensation and other customary insurance subject to various deductions, exclusions and coverage caps. The Company also conducts training and safety programs to promote a safe working environment and minimize hazards.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed 2,105 individuals directly and indirectly (through crewing or manning agreements), including 649 seafarers in the North Sea, 540 of whom are members of a union under the terms of an ongoing agreement.
 
Management considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory.
