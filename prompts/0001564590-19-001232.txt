Item 1.
Business
 We are a Fortune 200 corporation and a leading business process services company, providing a comprehensive range of distribution, logistics and integration services for the technology industry and providing outsourced services focused on customer engagement to a broad range of enterprises. We are organized to provide our products and services through two reportable business segments: Technology Solutions and Concentrix. Our Technology Solutions segment distributes peripherals, IT systems including data center server and storage solutions, system components, software, networking, communications, security equipment, consumer electronics, or CE, and complementary products. Within our Technology Solutions segment, we also provide systems design and integration solutions. Our Concentrix segment offers a portfolio of technology-enabled strategic solutions and end-to-end business services focused on customer engagement, process optimization, technology innovation, front and back-office automation and business transformation to clients in ten identified industry verticals.
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we distribute more than 30,000 technology products (as measured by active SKUs) from more than 400 IT, CE and original equipment manufacturers, or OEM, suppliers to more than 25,000 resellers, system integrators, and retailers throughout the United States, Canada, Japan and Central and South America. We purchase peripherals, IT systems, system components, software, networking, communications, security equipment, CE and complementary products

from our suppliers and sell them to our reseller and retail customers. We perform a similar function for our distribution of licensed software products. Our reseller customers include value-added resellers, or VARs, corporate resellers, government resellers, system integrators, direct marketers, and national and regional retailers. We combine our core strengths in distribution with demand generation, supply chain management and design and integration solutions to help our customers achieve greater efficiencies in time to market, cost minimization, real-time linkages in the supply chain and after-market product support. We also provide comprehensive IT solutions in key vertical markets such as government and healthcare and we provide specialized service offerings that increase efficiencies in the areas of print management, renewals, networking, logistics services and supply chain management. Additionally, we provide our customers with systems design and integration solutions for data center servers and networking solutions built specific to our customers’ workloads and data center environments.
 Our Technology Solutions business is characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin. The market for IT and CE products is generally characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles. We set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product or bundle of products we distribute and services we provide.
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we are highly dependent on the end-market demand for IT and CE products, and on our partners’ strategic initiatives and business models. This end-market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new IT and CE products and software by OEMs, replacement cycles for existing IT and CE products, trends toward cloud computing, overall economic growth and general business activity. A difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the IT and CE industries and increased price-based competition.
 In our Concentrix segment, we provide a comprehensive range of strategic services and solutions to enhance our clients’ customer life cycles to acquire, support and renew customer relationships, to automate and optimize processes, to maximize the value of every customer interaction and to improve business outcomes. Our portfolio of services includes end-to-end process outsourcing to customers in various industry vertical markets delivered through omni-channels that include both voice and non-voice mediums and in more than 70 languages. Our portfolio of solutions and services support our clients and their customers globally. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we acquired Convergys Corporation ("Convergys"), which added scale, diversified our revenue base, expanded Concentrix' delivery footprint and strengthened Concentrix' leadership position as a top global provider of customer engagement services.
 Our Concentrix segment generates revenue from performing services that are generally tied to our clients’ products and services and how they are received in the marketplace. Any shift in business or size of the market for our customers’ products, any failure of technology or failure of acceptance of our customers’ products in the market may impact our business. The employee turnover rate in this business and the risk of losing experienced employees is high. Higher turnover rates can increase costs and decrease operating efficiencies and productivity.
 We have been in business since 1980 and are headquartered in Fremont, California. We have significant operations in North and South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe. We were originally incorporated in the State of California as COMPAC Microelectronics, Inc. in November 1980, and we changed our name to SYNNEX Information Technologies, Inc. in February 1994. We later reincorporated in the State of Delaware under the name of SYNNEX Corporation in October 2003. As of November 30, 2018, we had over 230,000 full-time and temporary employees worldwide.
 Financial information by segment is provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.
 Our Products and Suppliers
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we distribute a broad line of IT products, including peripherals, IT systems, system components, software, security, UCC and networking equipment from more than 400 OEM suppliers, enabling us to offer comprehensive solutions to our reseller and retail customers. Our product offerings also include systems design and full rack integration solutions, build-to-order, and configure-to-order assemblies. Our Technology Solutions segment represented 88%, of our consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 89% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2016.

For fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, our product mix by category in the Technology Solutions segment was in the following ranges:
 
 
Product Category: | 
--------------------------------------------+----------
Peripherals | 25% - 29%
IT Systems | 22% - 30%
System Components and Integration Solutions | 26% - 33%
Software | 7% - 12% 
Networking Equipment | 7% - 11% 

 
Our suppliers include leading peripherals, IT systems, system components, software, security, networking equipment, UCC and CE manufacturers. Our primary OEM suppliers are Alphabet Inc. (Google), Asus Tek Computer Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., HP Inc. (“HP”), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Intel Corporation, Lenovo Group Ltd, Microsoft Corporation, Panasonic Corporation, and Samsung Semiconductor Inc.
 Our largest OEM supplier is HP. Revenue from the sale of products and services provided by HP represented approximately 12%, 13% and 17% of our consolidated revenue for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As is typical with our OEM supplier agreements, our United States Business Development Partner Agreement with HP is short-term and may be terminated without cause upon short notice. In the event of any breach of the agreement by us, HP may terminate the agreement and we may be required to refund HP any discounts or program payments paid during the period we were in breach of the agreement and reimburse HP for reasonable attorneys’ fees. In the event the agreement is terminated for cause or if we fail to perform our obligations under the agreement, our agreement with HP for the resale of products, support and services will automatically terminate upon such default or termination. If either party becomes insolvent or bankrupt, the other party may terminate the agreement without notice and cancel any unfulfilled obligations, except for payment obligations. Some of our subsidiaries also have territorial supplier agreements with subsidiaries of HP located in the respective countries.
 We have distribution agreements with most of our suppliers, including HP. These agreements usually provide for nonexclusive distribution rights and pertain to specific geographic territories. The agreements are also generally short-term, subject to periodic renewal, and often contain provisions permitting termination by either our supplier or us without cause upon relatively short notice. An OEM supplier that elects to terminate a distribution agreement will generally repurchase its products carried in our inventory.
 Our Technology Solutions business subjects us to the risk that the value of our inventory will be affected adversely by suppliers’ price reductions or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the products comprising our inventory. Many of our OEM suppliers offer us limited protection from the loss in value of our inventory due to technological change or a supplier’s price reduction. Under many of these agreements, we have a limited period of time to return or exchange products or claim price protection credits. We monitor our inventory levels and attempt to time our purchases to maximize our protection under supplier programs.
 Our Customers
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we distribute IT products to more than 25,000 resellers, system integrators and retailers. Resellers are classified primarily by their end-user customers. End-users include large corporations or enterprises, federal, state and local governments, small/medium sized businesses, or SMBs, and individual consumers. In addition, resellers vary greatly in size and geographic reach. Our reseller customers buy from us and other distributors. Our larger reseller customers also buy certain products directly from OEM suppliers. System integrators offer services in addition to product resale, primarily in systems customization, integration, and deployment. Retailers serve mostly individual end-users and to a small degree, small office/home office customers. We also provide systems design and integration solutions for data center servers built for our customers’ data center environments.
 In our Concentrix segment, we serve over 650 clients in ten industry verticals: automotive, banking & financial services, consumer electronics, energy & public sector, healthcare, insurance, media & communications, retail & e-commerce, technology, and travel, transportation & tourism. We focus on developing long-term, strategic relationships with large companies in these customer-intensive industry verticals to benefit from the complexity of services required, the anticipated growth of their market segments and their increasing need for more cost-effective customer engagement services.
 In fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, one customer accounted for 17%, 21% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. We do not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

We also support our clients loyalty and incentive programs, event administration, point of purchase and targeted lifecycle messaging to customers through services as described in our Customer Lifecycle Management services.
 Third Party Administration of Insurance Policies. We are a licensed Third Party Administrator of certain types of insurance policies that are managed through our proprietary insurance management system as well as other third party systems. The services are provided primarily in the United States.
 Enterprise Mobile Development. We provide mobile application development across multiple industries for both IOS and Android devices that are focused on Enterprise deployments through our Tigerspike business. Services within this group include UX/UI designed/development, optimization of applications and movement of on-premise systems to the cloud.
 Automation and Process Optimization. We deliver focused front office solutions with workflows and macro/desktop automation that drive improved staff efficiency, and implement cognitive systems/robotic process automation to replace manual touch points. These services use both internal technology assets as well as third party tools.
 Technology Assets. We license a number of our technology assets without being bundled with services which enable our clients to be more efficient, drive higher visibility to data and identify valuable customer patterns and insights from enterprise data to design better customer engagement strategies. These assets are used within our portfolio of services as well.
Sales and Marketing
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we serve our large commercial, government reseller, and retail customers through dedicated sales professionals. We market to smaller resellers and OEMs through dedicated regional sales teams. In addition, we have dedicated product management and business development specialists that focus on the sale and promotion of products and services of selected suppliers or for specific end-market verticals. These specialists are also directly involved in establishing new relationships with leading OEMs to create demand for their products and services and with resellers for their customers’ needs. We also have a direct sales approach for our design and integration solutions business. Our sales and marketing professionals are complemented by members of our executive management team who are integral in identifying potential new customer opportunities, promoting sales growth and ensuring customer satisfaction. We have sales and marketing professionals in close geographic proximity to our reseller, retail and OEM customers.
 In our Concentrix segment, we market our services through a sales force organized by industry vertical and geography. The length of our selling cycle varies depending on the type of engagement. Our efforts may begin in response to our lead generation program, a perceived opportunity, a reference by an existing client, a request for proposal or otherwise. The sales cycle varies depending on the type of services work as well as whether there is an existing relationship with the client.
 We have designated client partners or global relationship managers for each of our strategic relationships. The relationship manager is supported by process improvement, quality, transition, finance, human resources, information technology and industry or subject matter expert teams to ensure the best possible solution is provided to our clients.
 We also strive to foster relationships between our senior leadership team and our clients’ senior management. These “C-level” relationships ensure that both parties are focused on establishing priorities, aligning objectives and driving client value from the top down. High-level executive relationships have been particularly constructive as a means of increasing business from our existing clients. It also provides us with a forum for addressing client concerns. We constantly measure our client satisfaction levels to ensure that we maintain high service levels for each client.
 Our Operations
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we operate approximately 60 distribution and administrative facilities in the United States, Canada, Japan, China, Central and South America. Our distribution processes are highly automated to reduce errors, ensure timely order fulfillment and enhance the efficiency of our warehouse operations and back office administration. Our distribution facilities are geographically dispersed to be near reseller customers and their end-users. This decentralized, regional

strategy enables us to benefit from lower shipping costs and shorter delivery lead times to our customers. Furthermore, we track several performance measurements to continuously improve the efficiency and accuracy of our distribution operations. Our regional locations also enable us to make local deliveries and provide will-call fulfillment to more customers than if our distribution operations were more centralized, resulting in better service to our customers. Our workforce is comprised of permanent and temporary employees, enabling us to respond to short-term changes in order activity.
 Our proprietary IT systems and processes enable us to automate many of our distribution operations. We use radio frequency and bar code scanning technologies in all of our warehouse operations to maintain real-time inventory records, facilitate frequent cycle counts and improve the accuracy of order fulfillment.
 To enhance the accuracy of our distribution order fulfillment and protect our inventory from shrinkage, our distribution systems also incorporate numerous controls. These controls include order weight checks, bar code scanning, and serial number profile verification. We also use digital video imaging to record our small package shipping activities by order. These images and other warehouse and shipping data are available online to our customer service representatives, enabling us to quickly respond to order inquiries by our customers.
 We operate our principal system design and integration solutions facilities in the United States and we operate integration facilities in the United Kingdom and China. We generally design and integrate IT systems, data center servers and networking solutions and IT appliances, by incorporating system components purchased directly from vendors or obtained from our distribution inventory. Additionally, we perform other production value-added services, including thermal testing, power-draw efficiency testing, burn-in, quality and logistics support. Some of our design and integration solutions facilities are ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certified.
 In our Concentrix segment, we have global delivery capability which allows us to scale people and other resources from around the world, including foreign language fluency, proximity to clients and time-zone advantages. A critical component of this capability is our over 275 delivery and administrative centers in 40 countries throughout North and South America, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Africa. Our delivery centers improve the efficiency of our engagement teams through the reuse of processes, solution designs and infrastructure by leveraging the experience of delivery center professionals. Services are provided from these global locations to customers worldwide in multiple languages. These services are supported by proprietary technology to enable efficient and secure customer contact through various methods including voice, chat, web, email, social media and digital and mobility competencies by providing improved business intelligence and performance through enabling technologies. All of our legacy delivery centers are ISO 27001:2013 and PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council's Data Security Standards) version 3.2 certified. Many of the acquired Convergys customer accounts are also certified to these standards. Twelve of our delivery centers around the world are certified to COPC (Customer Operation Performance Center) OSP standard.
 We operate a distributed data processing environment that can integrate service delivery center data servers and databases with thirty nine data centers and point of presence strategically located across the globe. Our technologically-advanced and secured data centers provide availability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with redundant power and communication feeds and emergency power back-up, and are designed to withstand most natural disasters.
 The capacity of our data center and contact center operations, coupled with the scalability of our customer management solutions, enable us to meet the changing needs of large-scale and rapidly growing companies and government entities. By employing the scale and efficiencies of common application platforms, we can provide client-specific enhancements and modifications without incurring many of the costs of a full custom application, which positions us as a value-added provider of customer support products and services.
 International Operations
 Approximately 28% of our consolidated revenue is generated by our international operations. Our end market strategy for our Technology Solutions business, while focused on the Americas, is expanding internationally on a selective basis in order to provide our distribution capabilities to OEMs in locations that meet their regional requirements. A key element in our business strategy has been to locate our Concentrix service delivery contact centers in markets that are strategic to our customer requirements and cost beneficial. We have significant operations in the Philippines and India.
 Sales and cost concentrations in foreign jurisdictions subject us to various risks, including the impact of changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the US Dollar, which in turn can impact reported sales.
 See Note 13 -- Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional financial information related to foreign and domestic operations.

Seasonality
 Our operating results in the Technology Solutions segment are affected by the seasonality of the IT and CE products industries. We have historically experienced higher sales in our fourth fiscal quarter due to patterns in capital budgeting, federal government spending and purchasing cycles of our customers and end-users. These patterns may not be repeated in subsequent periods.
 Revenue in our Concentrix segment is typically the highest in our fourth fiscal quarter.
 Purchasing
 In our Technology Solutions segment, product cost represents our single largest expense and IT and CE product inventory is one of our largest working capital investments. Furthermore, product procurement from our OEM suppliers is a highly complex process that involves incentive programs, rebate programs, price protection, volume and early payment discounts and other arrangements. Consequently, efficient and effective purchasing operations are critical to our success.
 Our purchasing group works closely with many areas of our organization, especially our product managers who work closely with our OEM suppliers and our sales force, to understand the volume and mix of IT products that should be purchased.
 In addition, the purchasing group utilizes an internally developed, proprietary information systems application tool that further aids in forecasting future product demand based on several factors, including historical sales levels, expected product life cycle and current and projected economic conditions. We may also rely on our receipt of good-faith, non-binding, customer forecasts. We maintain electronic data interchange, or EDI, connection with our OEM suppliers to send purchase orders, receive purchase order status and receive notification once the product has shipped from our supplier. Our information system tool also tracks warehouse and channel inventory levels and open purchase orders on a real-time basis enabling us to stock inventory at a regional level closer to the customer as well as to actively manage our working capital resources. This level of automation promotes greater efficiencies of inventory management by replenishing and turning inventory, as well as placing purchase orders on a more frequent basis. Furthermore, our system tool also allows for automated checks and controls to prevent the generation of inaccurate orders.
 Managing our OEM supplier incentive programs is another critical function of our purchasing and product management teams. We attempt to maximize the benefits of incentives, rebates and volume and early payment discounts that our OEM suppliers offer us from time to time. We carefully evaluate these supplier incentive benefits relative to our product handling and carrying costs so that we do not over-invest in our inventory. We also closely monitor inventory levels on a product-by-product basis and plan purchases to take advantage of OEM supplier provided price protection. By managing inventory levels and monitoring customer purchase patterns at each of our regional distribution facilities, we believe we can minimize our shipping costs by stocking products near our resellers and retailers, and their end-user customers.
 Financial Services
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we offer various financing options to our customers as well as prepayment, credit card and cash on delivery terms. In providing credit terms to our reseller and retail customers, we closely and regularly monitor their creditworthiness through our information systems, credit ratings information and periodic detailed credit file reviews by our financial services staff. We have also purchased credit insurance in some geographies to further control credit risks. Finally, we establish reserves for estimated credit losses in the normal course of business based on the overall quality and aging of our accounts receivable portfolio, the existence of a limited amount of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks.
 We also sell to certain reseller customers pursuant to third party floor plan financing. The expenses charged by these financing companies are subsidized either by our OEM suppliers or paid by us. We generally receive payment from these financing companies within 15 to 30 days from the date of sale, depending on the specific arrangement.
 Information Technology
 Within our Technology Solutions segment, our IT systems manage the entire order cycle, including processing customer orders, customer billing and payment tracking. These internally developed IT systems make our operations more efficient and provide visibility into our operations. We believe our IT infrastructure is scalable to support further growth. We continue to enhance and invest in our IT systems to improve product and inventory management, streamline order and fulfillment processes, and increase operational flexibility.
 To allow our customers and suppliers to communicate and transact business with us in an efficient and consistent manner, we have implemented a mix of proprietary and off-the-shelf software programs that integrate our IT systems with those of our customers and suppliers. In particular, we maintain EDI, XML, web-based communication links and mobile platform applications with many of our reseller and retail customers to enable them to search for products, check real-time pricing, inventory availability and specifications, place and track orders, receive invoices and process returns.

Table of Content
 
Within our Concentrix segment, we invest in IT systems, infrastructure, automation and security to enhance workforce management and improve productivity. Our contact centers can employ a broad range of technology, including digital switching, intelligent call routing and tracking, proprietary workforce management systems, case management tools, proprietary software systems, computer telephony integration, interactive voice response, advanced speech recognition, web-based tools and relational database management systems with embedded security. Our innovative use of technology enables us to improve our voice, chat, web and e-mail handling and personnel scheduling, thereby increasing our efficiency and enhancing the quality of the services we deliver to our clients and their customers. We are able to respond to changes in client call volumes and manage call volume traffic based on agent availability. Additionally, we can use this technology to collect information concerning the contacts, including number, response time, duration and results of the contact and report the information to the client on a periodic basis for purposes of monitoring quality of service and accuracy of billing.
Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive global environment. The IT product industry is characterized by intense competition, based primarily on product availability, credit terms, price, speed and accuracy of delivery, effectiveness of sales and marketing programs, ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines, pre and post-sale technical support, flexibility and timely response to design changes, technological capabilities and product quality, service and support. We compete with a variety of regional, national and international IT product distributors and manufacturers.
 Our major competitors in our Technology Solutions segment include Arrow Electronics, Inc., Ingram Micro, Inc., ScanSource, Inc., and Tech Data Corporation and, to a lesser extent, regional distributors. We also face competition from our OEM suppliers that sell directly to resellers, retailers and end-users. The distribution industry has historically undergone, and continues to undergo, consolidation. Over the years, a number of providers within the IT distribution industry exited or merged with other providers. For example, during fiscal year 2017, we acquired the Westcon-Comstor Americas' distribution business and Tech Data Corporation acquired the Technology Solutions operating group of Avnet Inc. In 2016, Ingram Micro Inc. was acquired and became part of HNA Group. We have participated in this consolidation and expect to continue to assess opportunities.
 As we enter new business areas, we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors and/or new competitors. Some of our competitors are substantially larger and may have greater financial, operating, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Some of our competitors may have broader geographic breadth and range of services than us. Some may have more developed relationships with their existing customers. We attempt to offset our comparative scale differences by focusing on a limited number of leading OEMs in the Technology Solutions segment, by running a more efficient and low cost operation, and by offering a high level of value-added and customer services in both the Technology Solutions and Concentrix segments.
 In our Concentrix segment, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving global marketplace. Our competitors are both regional players as well as global companies. Our major competitors include Accenture plc, Conduent Inc., Genpact Limited, Globant S.A., SITEL Worldwide Corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Groupe Acticall), Sykes Enterprises Inc., Teleperformance S.A., TTEC Holdings, Inc., and Transcosmos Inc.
 In the future, we may face greater competition due to the consolidation of business process outsourcing providers. Consolidation activity may result in competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or more attractive pricing than ours. In addition, a client or potential client may choose not to outsource its business, by setting up captive outsourcing operations or by performing formerly outsourced services for themselves, or may switch customer care providers.
 We constantly seek to expand our business into areas primarily related to our core distribution and outsourced business services as well as other support, logistics and related value-added services, both organically and through strategic acquisitions.
 Employees
 As of November 30, 2018, we had approximately 229,000 full-time employees. Given the variability in our business and the quick response time required by customers, it is critical that we are able to rapidly ramp-up and ramp-down our operational capabilities to maximize efficiency. As a result, we use temporary or contract workers, who totaled approximately 2,600, on a full-time equivalent basis, as of November 30, 2018. Except for a small number of our employees in certain countries, generally required by local regulations or brought in through acquisitions, our employees are not represented by a labor union, nor are they covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
