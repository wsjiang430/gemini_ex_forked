ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Information
 
 Franklin Covey is a global company focused on organizational performance improvement.  Our mission is to “enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere,” and our global structure is designed to help individuals and organizations achieve sustained superior performance through changes in human behavior.  From the foundational work of Dr. Stephen R. Covey in leadership and personal effectiveness, and Hyrum W. Smith in productivity and time management, we have developed deep expertise that extends to helping organizations and individuals achieve lasting behavioral change in seven crucial areas: Leadership, Execution, Productivity, Trust, Sales Performance, Customer Loyalty, and Educational Improvement.  We believe that our clients are able to utilize our content and offerings to create cultures whose hallmarks are high-performing, collaborative individuals, led by effective, trust building leaders who execute with excellence and deliver measurably improved results for all of their key stakeholders.
 
The Company was incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the state of Utah, and we merged with the Covey Leadership Center in 1997 to form Franklin Covey Co.  Our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 totaled $225.4 million and our shares of common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “FC.”

Business Development
 
Our business is currently structured around two divisions, the Enterprise Division and the Education Division.  The Enterprise Division consists of our Direct Office and International Licensee segments and is focused on selling our offerings to corporations, governments, not-for-profits, and other related organizations.  Franklin Covey offerings delivered through the Enterprise Division are designed to help organizations and individuals achieve their own great results.  Our Education Division is centered around the principles found in the Leader in Me and is dedicated to helping educational institutions build cultures that will produce great results, including increased student performance, improved school culture, and increased parental and teacher involvement.
 
During 2016, we introduced the All Access Pass (AAP), which we believe is a ground-breaking subscription service that allows our clients unlimited access to our content through an electronic portal.  We believe the All Access Pass is a revolutionary and innovative way to deliver our content to clients of various sizes, including large, multinational organizations in a flexible and cost-effective manner.  Clients may utilize complete offerings such as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and The 5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity, or use individual concepts from any of our well-known offerings to create a custom solution to fit their organizational or individual training needs.  Since the introduction of the All Access Pass, we have invested in additional implementation specialists to provide our clients with the direction necessary to create meaningful impact journeys using our tools and content.  An impact journey is a customized plan to utilize the content and offerings on the AAP to achieve a client’s specific goals and to provide them with the keys to obtain maximum value from the pass.  We have also translated All Access Pass materials into numerous additional languages, which allows the AAP to be used effectively by multinational entities and provides for greater international sales opportunities.  The AAP is primarily sold through our Enterprise Division.
 
In our Education Division, we have launched the Leader in Me membership, which provides coaching, access to the Leader in Me online service, and authorizes use of Franklin Covey’s proprietary intellectual property.  The Leader in Me online service provides access to student leadership guides, leadership lessons, illustrated leadership stories, and a variety of other resources to enable an educational institution to effectively implement and utilize the Leader in Me program.  We believe that the tools and resources available through the Leader in Me membership will provide measurable results that are designed to develop student leadership, improve school culture, and increase academic proficiency.
 
We believe that continued investments in personnel, content, and technological innovation are key to subscription service renewals and the future growth of our offerings.
 
In addition to the internal development of our offerings as previously described, we have sought to grow through opening new international offices and through acquisitions of businesses and content licenses.  Over the past three years, these activities have included the following:
 
  
• | New Offices in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria – During fiscal 2019, we acquired the former independent licensee that provided services in these countries and transitioned the operations into directly owned offices similar to the fiscal 2017 transition of our China licensee into a direct office operation. We believe that we will be able to significantly grow our business in these countries through this acquisition. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | License of “Multipliers” Leadership Content – During late fiscal 2019, we obtained a license to develop and sell Multipliers leadership content written by Liz Wiseman. We are currently in the process of developing various offerings based on Multipliers content and are currently expecting to launch these courses in the fall of 2020. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Offices in China – In fiscal 2017, we transitioned the operations of our licensee operations in China into direct offices. With offices in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, we have grown our operations in China during the past three years and believe we are positioned for significant future growth. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Robert Gregory Partners – In third quarter of fiscal 2017, we acquired the assets of Robert Gregory Partners, LLC (RGP), a corporate coaching firm with expertise in executive coaching, transition acceleration coaching, leadership development coaching, implementation coaching, and consulting. We believe these coaching services are important components of our various offerings. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Jhana Education – In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we acquired the stock of Jhana Education (Jhana), a company that specializes in the creation and dissemination of relevant, bite-sized content and learning tools for leaders and managers. These services have been a significant strategic addition to our All Access Pass and Leader in Me online offerings.

Services Overview
 
We operate globally with one common brand and a business model designed to enable us to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service.  To achieve this high level of service we have sales and support associates in various locations around the United States and Canada, and operate wholly owned subsidiaries in Australia, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.  In foreign locations where we do not have a directly owned office, we may contract with independent licensee partners who deliver our content and provide services in over 140 other countries and territories around the world.
 
Our mission is to “enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere,” and we believe that we are experts at solving certain pervasive, intractable problems, each of which requires a change in human behavior.  We seek to consistently deliver world-class content with the broadest and deepest distribution capabilities through the most flexible content delivery modalities.  We believe these characteristics distinguish us from our competitors as follows:
 
 
1. | World Class Content – Rather than rely on “flavor of the month” training fads, our content is principle-centered and based on natural laws of human behavior and effectiveness. Our content is designed to build new skillsets, establish new mindsets, and provide enabling toolsets. When our content is applied consistently in an organization, we believe the culture of that organization will change to enable the organization to achieve its own great purposes. Our content is well researched, subjected to numerous field beta tests, and improved through a proven development process. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Breadth and Scalability of Delivery Options – We have a wide range of content delivery options, including: The All Access Pass and Leader in Me membership, other intellectual property licensing arrangements, on-site training, training led through certified facilitators, on-line learning, blended learning, and organization-wide transformational processes, including consulting and coaching services. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Global Capability – We not only operate domestically with sales personnel in the United States and Canada, but we also deliver content through our directly owned international offices and independently owned international licensees who deliver our content in over 140 other countries and territories around the world. This capability allows us to deliver content to a wide range of customers, from large multinational corporations to smaller local entities. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We hold ourselves responsible for and measure ourselves by our clients’ achievement of transformational results.
 
Our content and offerings are designed to help our clients achieve their own great purposes through a variety of resources, including best-selling books and audio, innovative and widely recognized thought leadership, and multiple delivery and teaching methods.  These elements allow us to offer our clients training and consulting solutions that are designed to improve individual and organizational behaviors, deliver content that adapts to an organization’s unique needs, and provide meaningful improvements in our clients’ business performance.  Further information about our content and services can be found on our website at www.franklincovey.com.  However, the information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute any part of this Annual Report.

Industry Information
 
According to the Training magazine 2019 Training Industry Survey, the total size of the U.S. training industry is estimated to be $83 billion.  The training industry is highly fragmented and includes a wide variety of training and service providers of varying sizes.  We believe our competitive advantages in this industry stem from our fully integrated principle-centered training offerings, our wide variety of delivery options, and various implementation tools to help organizations and individuals measurably improve their effectiveness.  These advantages allow us to deliver not only training to corporations, educational institutions, and individuals, but also to implement the training through powerful behavior-changing tools and coaching with the capability to then measure the impact of the delivered content and solutions.
Clients
 
We have a relatively broad base of clients, which includes thousands of organizational, governmental, educational, and individual clients in both the United States and in other countries that are served through our directly owned operations.  We have thousands of additional organizational clients throughout the world which are served through our global licensee partner network, and we believe that our content, in all its forms, delivers results that encourage strong client loyalty.  Our clients are in a broad array of industries and we are not dependent on a single client or industry group.  During the periods presented in this report, none of our clients were responsible for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues.
 
Due to the nature of our business, we do not have a significant backlog of orders.  Nearly all of our deferred revenue is attributable to subscription services for which we recognize revenue over the lives of the corresponding agreements.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations of various sizes that offer services comparable with ours.  The nature of competition in the performance improvement industry, however, is highly fragmented with few large competitors.  Based upon our fiscal 2019 consolidated sales of $225.4 million, we believe that we are a significant competitor in the performance skills and education market.  Other significant comparative companies that compete with our Enterprise Division include: Design Dimension International, GP Strategies Corp., LinkedIn Learning, Center for Creative Leadership, SkillSoft, and Vital Smarts.  Our Education Division competes with entities such as: Character Counts, Responsive Classroom, 7 Mindsets, Second Step, and K12.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industry in which we compete include the following:
 
 
• | Quality of offerings, services, and solutions
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Skills and capabilities of people
--+----------------------------------


• | Innovative training and consulting services combined with effective products
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to add value to client operations
--+------------------------------------------


• | Reputation and client references
--+---------------------------------


• | Price
--+------


• | Availability of appropriate resources
--+--------------------------------------


• | Global reach and scale
--+-----------------------


• | Branding and name recognition in our marketplace
--+-------------------------------------------------



Given the relative ease of entry into the training market, the number of our competitors could increase, many of whom may imitate existing methods of distribution, or could offer similar content and programs at lower prices.  However, we believe that we have several areas of competitive differentiation in our industry.  We believe that our competitive advantages include: (1) the quality of our content, as indicated by our strong gross margins, branded content, and best-selling books; (2) the breadth of delivery options we are able to offer to customers for utilizing our content, including the All Access Pass and Leader in Me membership, live presentations by our own training consultants, live presentations though Company certified client-employed facilitators, intellectual property licensing, web-based presentations, and film-based presentations; (3) our global reach, which allows truly multinational clients to scale our content uniformly across the globe, through our mix of direct offices and our global licensee network; and (4) the significant impact which our offerings can have on our clients’ results.  Moreover, we believe that we are a market leader in the U.S. in leadership, execution, productivity, individual effectiveness, and educational improvement.

Seasonality
 
Our fourth quarter of each fiscal year typically has higher sales and operating income than other fiscal quarters primarily due to increased revenues in our Education Division (when school administrators and faculty have professional development days) and to increased sales that typically occur during that quarter from year-end incentive programs.  Overall, training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training, which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and certain vacation periods.
Manufacturing and Distribution
 
We do not manufacture any of our products.  We purchase our training materials and related products from various vendors and suppliers located both domestically and internationally, and we are not dependent upon any one vendor for the production of our training and related materials as the raw materials for these products are readily available.  We currently believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers and contractors.  Our materials are primarily warehoused and distributed from an independent warehouse facility located in Des Moines, Iowa.
Trademarks, Copyrights, and Intellectual Property
 
Our success has resulted in part from our proprietary content, methodologies, and other intellectual property rights.  We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements.  We claim rights for over 630 trademarks in the United States and foreign countries, and we have obtained registration in the United States and numerous foreign countries for many of our trademarks including FranklinCovey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The 4 Disciplines of Execution, and The 7 Habits.  We consider our trademarks and other proprietary rights to be important and material to our business.
 
We claim over 230 registered copyrights, and own sole or joint copyrights on our books, manuals, text and other printed information provided in our training programs, and other electronic media products, including audio and video media.  We may license, rather than sell, facilitator workbooks and other seminar and training materials in order to protect our intellectual property rights therein.  We place trademark and copyright notices on our instructional, marketing, and advertising materials.  In order to maintain the proprietary nature of our product information, we enter into written confidentiality agreements with certain executives, product developers, sales professionals, training consultants, other employees, and licensees.
 
Employees
 
One of our most important assets is our people.  The diverse and global makeup of our workforce allows us to serve a variety of clients on a worldwide basis.  We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining quality personnel and actively strive to reinforce our employees’ commitment to our clients, and to our mission, vision, culture, and values through the creation of a motivational and rewarding work environment.  We currently have approximately 940 associates around the world and management believes that its relations with its associates is good.  None of our associates are represented by a union or other collective bargaining group.  While competition is intense for skilled personnel in various functions, we currently do not foresee a shortage in qualified personnel needed to operate and grow our business.
 
Our benefit programs are designed to be both comprehensive and tailored to the needs of our employee population, such as a paid time off policy that allows for flexibility to meet our associates’ needs.  Our wellness benefits are aimed at encouraging employees to be aware of their current state of health and provides various tools and resources to assist them in maintaining their health given the demanding nature of the work.  Through our offered benefits, including health plans, retirement benefits, stock purchase plan, and other benefit programs, we seek to provide a core sense of security to our employees.
