Each of our reportable segments is composed of certain operating segments that are aggregated primarily by the nature of products offered. These are the Piping Systems, Industrial Metals, and Climate segments.
Certain administrative expenses and expenses related primarily to retiree benefits at inactive operations are combined into the Corporate and Eliminations classification.  
Financial information concerning segments and geographic information appears under “Note 3 – Segment Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
New housing starts and commercial construction are important determinants of our sales to the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC), refrigeration, and plumbing markets because the principal end use of a significant portion of our products is in the construction of single and multi-family housing and commercial buildings.  Repairs and remodeling projects are also important drivers of underlying demand for these products.  In addition, our products are used in various transportation, automotive, and industrial applications.
Piping Systems Segment
The Piping Systems segment is composed of Domestic Piping Systems Group, Great Lakes Copper (Great Lakes), Heatlink Group, European Operations, Trading Group, Jungwoo Metal Ind. Co., LTD (Jungwoo-Mueller), and Mueller Middle East BSC (Mueller Middle East).  
The Domestic Piping Systems Group manufactures and distributes copper tube, fittings, line sets, and pipe nipples, and resells steel pipe, brass and plastic plumbing valves, malleable iron fittings and faucets, and plumbing specialties.  These products are manufactured in the U.S., sold in the U.S., and exported to markets worldwide. Our copper tube ranges in size from 1/8 inch to 8 1/8 inch diameter and is sold in various straight lengths and coils.  We are a market leader in the plumbing, air-conditioning and refrigeration service tube markets and we also supply a variety of water tube in straight lengths and coils used for plumbing applications in virtually every type of construction project.

Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 5,137 employees, of which approximately 1,635 were represented by various unions.  Those union contracts will expire as follows:

Location | Expiration Date 
Port Huron, Michigan (Local 218 IAM) | May 3, 2026 
Wynne, Arkansas (MCTP) | November 30, 2024
Port Huron, Michigan (Local 44 UAW) | May 4, 2025

Fulton, Mississippi | October 2, 2025 
University Park, Illinois | June 20, 2024 
Woodbridge, New Jersey | April 30, 2023 

The union agreements at the Company’s U.K. and Mexico operations are renewed annually.  The Company expects to renew its union contracts without material disruption to its operations. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. The health and safety of our employees is our high priority and in particular, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have taken additional measures to limit possible infections at the workplace. 
Furthermore, we expect that our employees and members of our Board of Directors will conduct themselves ethically and properly as a matter of course and comply with the guidelines set forth on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
Raw Material and Energy Availability
A substantial portion of our base metal requirements (primarily copper) is normally obtained through short-term supply contracts with competitive pricing provisions (for cathode) and the open market (for scrap).  Other raw materials used in the production of brass, including brass scrap, zinc, tin, and lead are obtained from zinc and lead producers, open-market dealers, and customers with brass process scrap.  Raw materials used in the fabrication of aluminum and plastic products are purchased in the open market from major producers.
Adequate supplies of raw material have historically been available to us from primary producers, metal brokers, and scrap dealers.  Sufficient energy in the form of natural gas, fuel oils, and electricity is available to operate our production facilities.  While temporary shortages of raw material and fuels may occur occasionally, to date they have not materially hampered our operations.
Our copper tube facilities can accommodate both refined copper and certain grades of copper scrap as the primary feedstock.  The Company has commitments from refined copper producers for a portion of its metal requirements for 
2023.  Adequate quantities of copper are currently available.  While we will continue to react to market developments, resulting pricing volatility or supply disruptions, if any, could nonetheless adversely affect the Company.
Environmental Proceedings
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a matter of high priority for the Company.  Mueller’s provision for environmental matters related to all properties was $1.4 million for 2022, $5.0 million for 2021, and $4.2 million for 2020.  The reserve for environmental matters was $20.5 million at December 31, 2022 and $27.4 million at December 25, 2021.  Environmental expenses related to non-operating properties are presented below operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and costs related to operating properties are included in cost of goods sold.  We currently anticipate that we will need to make expenditures of approximately $6.8 million for compliance activities related to existing environmental matters during the next three fiscal years.
For a description of material pending environmental proceedings, see “Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Other Business Factors
Our business is not materially dependent on patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, or concessions held.  In addition, expenditures for Company-sponsored research and development activities were not material during 2022, 2021, or 2020.  No material portion of our business involves governmental contracts.  
Seasonality
Our net sales typically moderate in the fourth quarter as a result of the seasonal construction markets and customer shutdowns for holidays, year-end plant maintenance, and physical inventory counts. Also, our working capital typically increases in the first quarter in preparation for the construction season.
