Item 1. Business 
General
Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) is an independent exploration and production company based in Houston, Texas, focused on U.S. resource plays with operations in the United States, Europe and Africa. Our corporate headquarters is located at 5555 San Felipe Street, Houston, Texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. Each of our two reportable operating segments are organized by geographic location and managed according to the nature of the products and services offered. The two segments are:

• | United States – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States;


• | International – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.

We were incorporated in 2001. On July 1, 2011 we became an Independent E&P after we completed the spin-off of our refining, marketing and transportation business, creating two independent energy companies: Marathon Oil and MPC.
Our strategy is to deliver competitive and improving corporate level returns by focusing our capital investment in the lower cost, higher margin U.S. resource plays while maintaining a peer-leading balance sheet, prioritizing sustainable cash flow generation at conservative oil prices, and returning capital to shareholders. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.
Our portfolio is concentrated in our core operations in the U.S. resource plays and E.G. The map below shows the locations of our core operations:
* Our additional locations include the U.K, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (executed a sales agreement in 2018) and other United States locations.
Segment Information
In the following discussion regarding our United States and International segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. During the year, we renamed our United States E&P and International E&P segments to the United States and International segments. The characteristics and composition of these segments remained unchanged and there was no effect on previously reported segment information. See Note 1 for further information.

United States Segment
We are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the U.S. Our primary focus in the United States segment is concentrated within our four high quality resource plays. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further detail on current year results.
United States – U.S. Resource Plays 
Eagle Ford – We have been operating in the South Texas Eagle Ford play since 2011, where roughly two thirds of our acreage is located in Karnes and Atascosa Counties. Our focus is capital efficient development with a goal of maximizing returns and cash flow generation while extending our core acreage. We operate 32 central gathering and treating facilities across the play that support more than 1,600 producing wells. We also own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in Karnes and Atascosa Counties. 
Bakken – We have been operating in the Williston Basin since 2006. The majority of our core acreage is within McKenzie, Mountrail, and Dunn Counties in North Dakota targeting the Middle Bakken and Three Forks reservoirs. We continue focusing our investment in our high-return Myrmidon and Hector areas, while also delineating our position across the rest of our acreage. 
Oklahoma – With a history in Oklahoma that dates back more than 100 years, our primary focus has recently been the transition to early infill development in the STACK Meramec and SCOOP Woodford, while progressing delineation of other plays across our footprint. We primarily hold net acreage with rights to the Woodford, Springer, Meramec, Osage and other prospect intervals, with a majority of this in the SCOOP and STACK. 
Northern Delaware – We have been operating in the Northern Delaware basin, which is located within the greater Permian area, since we closed on two major acquisitions in 2017. These acquisitions gave us a strong foundational footprint in the region where we have the majority of our acreage in Eddy and Lea counties primarily in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring New Mexico plays. Our focus since entering the play has been to strategically advance our position and prepare for future development by further coring up our footprint, progressing early delineation of our acreage, improving our cost structure and securing midstream solutions. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. 
Other United States 
Our remaining properties in the United States primarily consist of our newly acquired acreage in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk play and outside operated assets in the Gulf of Mexico, including our 3.5% overriding royalty interest in the Ursa fields. During 2018 we acquired approximately 260,000 net acres in the Louisiana Austin Chalk play at a cost of less than $850 per acre. Additionally, in the fourth quarter 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our working interest in the Droshky field, in the Gulf of Mexico, and as a result it is classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. This transaction closed in the first quarter of 2019. 
During 2018 we closed on the sale of several non-core conventional properties, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. 
International Segment 
We are engaged in oil and gas development and production across our international locations primarily in E.G. and U.K. We include the results of our LPG processing plant, gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in E.G. in our International segment. 
International 
Equatorial Guinea – We own a 63% operated working interest under a production sharing contract in the Alba field and an 80% operated working interest in Block D, both of which are offshore E.G. Operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 97% in 2018. 
Equatorial Guinea – Gas Processing – We own a 52% interest in Alba Plant LLC, accounted for as an equity method investment, which operates an onshore LPG processing plant located on Bioko Island. Alba field natural gas, under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, is processed by the LPG plant. The LPG plant extracts secondary condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. 
We also own 60% of EGHoldings and 45% of AMPCO, both accounted for as equity method investments. EGHoldings operates a 3.7 mmta LNG production facility and AMPCO operates a methanol plant, both located on Bioko Island. These facilities allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba field. The LNG production facility sells LNG under a 3.4 mmta sales and purchase agreement. Under the agreement, which runs through 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index. Gross sales of LNG from this production facility 
6

totaled approximately 3.5 mmta in 2018. AMPCO had gross sales totaling approximately 1,000 mt in 2018. Methanol production is sold to customers in Europe and the U.S. 
United Kingdom – Our operated assets in the U.K. sector of the North Sea are the Brae area complex where we have a 42% working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields, a 39% working interest in the East Brae field, and a 28% working interest in the nearby Braemar field. We own non-operated working interests in the Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28% working interest in the main Foinaven field, a 47% working interest in East Foinaven and a 20% working interest in the T35 and T25 fields. 
Libya – In the first quarter of 2018, we closed on the sale of our subsidiary, Marathon Oil Libya Limited, which held our 16.33% non-operated interest in the Waha concessions in Libya. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. 
Other International 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq – We have a non-operated 15% working interest in the Atrush block located north-northwest of Erbil. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our Kurdistan subsidiary, Marathon Oil KDV B.V., and as a result it is classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. We expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2019 which will complete our full country exit from Kurdistan. 
Additionally during 2018, we entered into separate agreements to sell certain non-core properties in our International segment. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions.
Reserves
Proved reserves are required to be disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves. A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent. Other International ("Other Int’l"), includes the U.K. and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Approximately 86% of our proved reserves are located in OECD countries, with 84% located within the U.S.
The following tables set forth estimated quantities of our total proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves based upon SEC pricing for period ended December 31, 2018.

Acreage
We believe we have satisfactory title to our United States and International properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry; nevertheless, we can be involved in title disputes from time to time which may result in litigation. In the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. Our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry. In addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international production sharing contracts or exploration licenses.
The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage held in our United States and International segments as of December 31, 2018.

Marketing 
Our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. These activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. We balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale.
Gross Delivery Commitments
We have committed to deliver gross quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas to customers under a variety of contracts. As of December 31, 2018, the contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to the following commitments:

 | 2019 | 2020 | | 2021 | Thereafter | Commitment Period Through
Eagle Ford | | | | | | 
Crude and condensate (mbbld) | 65 | | 51 | | — | | — | 2020
Natural gas liquids (mbbld) | 1 | | — | | — | | — | 2020

Northern Delaware | | | | | | 
Crude and condensate (mbbld) | 21 | | 19 | | — | | — | 2020

All of these contracts provide the options of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate to satisfy our commitment. In addition to the contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. Some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms.
11

Competition 
Competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies. We compete, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves, acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties, the marketing and delivery of our production into worldwide commodity markets and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical, and engineering research and technology, experience and expertise, economic analysis in connection with portfolio management, and safely operating oil and gas producing properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. 
Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. These laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution or recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. 
New laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined.
For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.
Air and Climate Change
Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have focused considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. Developments in greenhouse gas initiatives may affect us and other similarly situated companies operating in the oil and gas industry. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective.
Government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states and other jurisdictions seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Marathon Oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow.
The EPA finalized a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone in October 2015. States that contain any areas designated as non-attainment, and any tribes that choose to do so, will be required to complete development of implementation plans in the 2020-2021 time frame. The EPA may in the future designate additional areas as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. Although there may be

an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. The EPA's final rule has been judicially challenged by both industry and other interested parties, and the outcome of this litigation may also impact implementation and revisions to the rule.
In November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued a final rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to BLM jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements.  BLM issued a two-year stay of these requirements in December 2017. In September 2018, BLM published a final rule to rescind substantial portions of the rule. The rescission was challenged by multiple parties in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. If the judicial challenges to the rule are successful and the rule were to come back into effect, the requirements would result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. Various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. 
Water
In 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and its various programs. While these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule has been stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. In December 2018, EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would amend the 2015 regulations to narrow the scope of federal CWA jurisdiction. If the new proposed rule is not finalized and the 2015 rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of CWA jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities.

Concentrations of Credit Risk
We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. In 2018, sales to Valero Marketing and Supply and Flint Hills Resources and each of their respective affiliates, each accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenues. In 2017, sales to Vitol and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. In 2016, sales to Valero Marketing and Supply, Tesoro Petroleum, and Flint Hills Resources and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 13%, 11% and 10% of our total revenues. 
Trademarks, Patents and Licenses
We currently hold U.S. and foreign patents. Although in the aggregate our trademarks and patents are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, or group of related trademarks or patents as critical or essential to our business as a whole.
Employees
We had approximately 2,400 active, full-time employees as of December 31, 2018.
