ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview 
Luminar is a global automotive technology company ushering in a new era of vehicle safety and autonomy. Over the past decade, Luminar has been building from the chip-level up, our light detection and ranging sensor, or lidar, which is expected to meet the demanding performance, safety, reliability and cost requirements to enable next generation safety and autonomous capabilities for passenger and commercial vehicles as well as other adjacent markets.
The global mobility and e-mobility sector is increasingly focused on safety and autonomy, specifically next generation advanced driver assistance systems, or ADAS, and highway autonomy for passenger and commercial vehicles. Our products provide increased situational awareness in a broad range of driving environments through improved and higher confidence detection and planning at all vehicle speeds. Our portfolio encompasses sensor hardware and in-development perception and decision-making software as well as a high definition “3D” mapping engine that improve existing vehicle safety features and enable new levels of vehicle automation for passenger, commercial and other applications.
Our Markets 
The Society of Automotive Engineers (“SAE”) defines levels of automation as follows, which SAE updates from time to time:
•Level 0—No Driving Automation: In this level, the human is fully responsible for all dynamic driving tasks (“DDT”) at all times, even if an active safety system assists in the task. “L0” is defined as driver support features that are limited to warnings or momentary emergency intervention. Examples of warnings include blind spot warning or lane departure warnings. Examples of features with momentary assistance include automated emergency braking (“AEB”) and lane keep assist (“LKA”).
•Level 1—Driver Assistance: In this level, while the human is fully responsible for all DDT at all times, an active safety system may assist by executing either the longitudinal or the lateral vehicle motion control subtask, and disengages immediately upon driver request. Examples include lane centering support (“LCS”) or the more widely adopted adaptive cruise control (“ACC”). These features are viewed as comfort features, easing the driving load from the driver during extended highway drives.
•Level 2—Partial Driving Automation: In this level, the human is fully responsible for all DDT at all times, even if an active safety system assists in the task.
The term L2+ is often used for today’s higher capability systems, many of which add a driver monitoring system, such as camera or steering wheel sensing to ensure the human driver remains engaged, but require the driver remain attentive at all times. 
•Level 3—Conditional Driving Automation: In this level, the automated driving system (“ADS”) performs the entire DDT while engaged. The driver is responsible to verify the operational readiness of the ADS, determine whether to engage the system, and becomes the fallback-ready user when the ADS is engaged. The ADS permits engagement and operation only within its operational design domains (“ODD”). 
• Level 4—High Driving Automation: In this level, the ADS performs the entire DDT while engaged. The driver is responsible to verify the operational readiness of the ADS, determine whether to engage the system, and becomes a passenger when the ADS is engaged (when physically present in the vehicle). The ADS permits engagement and operation only within its ODD.
•Level 5—Full Driving Automation: In this level, the ADS performs the entire DDT while engaged. It is the designation for vehicles that when placed in automated driving mode, can drive everywhere and in all conditions without human intervention or even occupants. 
We believe the market is currently segmented in two distinct categories: (1) ADAS (L0 / L1 / L2) and (2) autonomous driving (L3 / L4 / L5). Within these two segments, we believe the largest near-term business opportunities exist for technologies that enhance, not replace, the driver in ADAS and highway autonomy applications (L3). We believe our products meaningfully improve ADAS functionality and are also key enablers for highway autonomy. 
ADAS and Proactive SafetyTM
ADAS standards are primarily driven by both the European and North American markets. The European New Car Assessment Program (“NCAP”), a voluntary vehicle safety performance assessment program which uses a 5-star safety rating system, requires a minimum level of crash mitigation functionality such as automated emergency braking (“AEB”) (for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists), lane keep assist (“LKA”), speed alert systems and other ADAS features for a vehicle to have a 5-star rating. Furthermore, we believe the European Union may be moving toward mandates of these advanced functions. 
The U.S. is less focused on mandates at this time and instead allows the U.S. New Car Assessment Program (known as the “Stars on Cars” program) and designations such as the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety “Top Safety Pick” and “Top Safety Pick+” to drive adoption and provide consumers with an understanding of the vehicle’s advanced crash avoidance capability. Through 2022, working with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), 20 automakers have made progress towards equipping most new passenger vehicles with a low-speed AEB system that includes forward-collision warning. 
With global safety rating programs and the OEMs competing to deliver more safety and comfort features to their customers, it is reasonable to expect near complete adoption of ADAS functionalities in new vehicles produced by Europe, U.S., Japan, and South Korea by 2026. We expect adoption rates to increase significantly in China as well. 
According to NHTSA, the number of automotive fatalities globally still exceeds one million annually and the social costs of accidents continue to exceed $500 billion in the United States alone. While the increased application of existing ADAS technology should help reduce the number of accidents and fatalities, we believe there is significant room for improvement in these technologies. In particular, we believe there is a significant opportunity to reduce collisions with a capable lidar sensing system that increases the quality and reliability of the perception data collected by vehicles and enables improved ADAS functionality in a wider range of environmental conditions and higher speeds. We have been developing a turn-key ADAS system known as Proactive SafetyTM that leverages our core sensor and software technologies. Intended functionality for Proactive SafetyTM currently under development includes Automatic Emergency Braking, Automatic Emergency Steering, and Adaptive Cruise Control, which are expected to represent a new generation of vehicle safety, meant to enable accident avoidance instead of merely mitigating crash severity.
Highway Autonomy 
Our focus since inception has been to enable ubiquitous safety and autonomy and we view highway autonomy, in combination with Proactive SafetyTM, as providing the most value to the end consumer for the foreseeable future. The market appears to be trending in this direction, targeting hands-off and eyes-off operations in a more controlled setting than the urban environment. While there has historically been a significant focus on investment and development of robo-taxi solutions, we believe the passenger vehicles and commercial vehicle sectors will be the greatest source of demand for our products over the next several years. 
Passenger Vehicle Market
The passenger vehicle market is very large. We expect that approximately 100 million new passenger and commercial vehicles will be manufactured annually, on average, this decade. In order to realize a vehicle feature’s maximum societal benefits, the ultimate goal in the automotive industry is to achieve widespread adoption of next-gen safety and highway autonomous features in all vehicles. We expect a technology adoption ramp-up over time as automated functionality matures, costs and pricing are reduced, and consumers become more familiar with the full benefits and capabilities of a safe autonomy system. We believe there is a substantial market opportunity for our products once development of Proactive SafetyTM is complete and coupled with autonomy due to the public benefit of the overall anticipated safety increase.
Commercial Trucking Market 
The amount of goods transported by trucking globally continues to rise year-over-year. The application of ADAS technology continues to grow and the interest in autonomy for commercial transport is at an all-time high. The business case for trucking highway autonomy includes: lower operating costs, increased utilization of the vehicles and more time spent on the road. 
Robo-Taxi Market 
The robo-taxi industry continues to develop through investment and partnerships by leading technology companies and mainstays from the automotive industry. Although the timeline for widespread deployment of robo taxies continues to be pushed out due to the complexity of the technical requirements, as well as the need for regional and federal governmental support, funding for infrastructure, and a sensing and compute solution that must anticipate every possible mixed-traffic scenario, the robo-taxi market remains an important market for lidar both for near-term validation and for long-term demand. 
Adjacent Markets 
Adjacent markets such as last mile delivery, aerospace and defense, robotics and security offer use cases for which our technology is well suited. Our goal is to scale our core markets and utilize our robust solutions to best serve these adjacent markets where it makes sense for us and our partners.
Our Products 
Our Iris and other products are described in further detail below:
Hardware 
Iris:  Iris lidar combines laser transmitter and receiver and provides long-range, 1550 nm sensory meeting OEM specs for advanced safety and autonomy. This technology provides efficient automotive-grade, and affordable solutions that are scalable, reliable, and optional for series production. Iris lidar sensors are dynamically configurable dual-axis scan sensors that detect objects up to 600 meters away over a horizontal field of view of 120° and a software configurable vertical field of view of up to 30°, providing high point densities in excess of 200 points per square degree enable long-range detection, tracking, and classification over the whole field of view. Iris is refined to meet the size, weight, cost, power, and reliability requirements of automotive qualified series production sensors. Iris features our vertically integrated receiver, detector, and laser solutions developed by our Advanced Technologies & Services segment companies - Freedom Photonics, Black Forest Engineering, and Optogration. The internal development of these key technologies gives us a significant advantage in the development of our product roadmap. 
Software 
Software presently under development includes the following:
Core Sensor Software:  Our lidar sensors are configurable and capture valuable information extracted from the raw point-cloud to promote the development and performance of perception software. Our core sensor software features are being designed to help our commercial partners to operate and integrate our lidar sensors and control, and enrich the sensor data stream before perception processing. 
Perception Software: Our perception software is in design to transform lidar point-cloud data into actionable information about the environment surrounding the vehicle. This information includes classifying static objects such as lane markings, road surface, curbs, signs and buildings as well as other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and animals. Through internal development as well as the recent acquisition of certain assets of Solfice (aka Civil Maps), we expect to be able to utilize our point-cloud data to achieve precise vehicle localization and to create and provide continuous updates to a high definition map of a vehicle’s environment.
Sentinel:  Sentinel is our full-stack software platform for safety and autonomy that will enable Proactive SafetyTM and highway autonomy for cars and commercial trucks. 
Our software products are in designing and coding phase of the development and had not yet achieved technological feasibility as at end of 2022.
Competition 
The market for lidar-enabled vehicle features, on and off road, is an emerging one with many potential applications in the development stage. As a result, we face competition for lidar hardware business from a range of companies seeking to have their products incorporated into these applications. We believe we hold a strong position based on both hardware product performance and maturity, and our growing ability to develop deeply integrated software capabilities needed to provide autonomous and safety solutions to our customers.
Within the automotive autonomy software space, the competitive landscape is still nascent and primarily focused on developing robo-taxi technologies as opposed to autonomous software solutions for passenger vehicles. Other autonomous software providers include: in-house OEM software teams; automotive silicon providers; large technology companies and newer technology companies focused on autonomous software. We partner with several of these autonomous software providers to provide our lidar and other products.
Beyond automotive, the adjacent markets, including delivery bots and mapping, among others, are highly competitive. There are entrenched incumbents and competitors, including from China, particularly around ultra-low cost products that are widely available.
Intellectual Property 
Our success and competitive advantage depend in part upon our ability to develop and protect our core technology and intellectual property. We own a portfolio of intellectual property, including patents and registered trademarks, confidential technical information, and expertise in the development of lidar technology and software for autonomous vehicles. 
We have filed patent and trademark applications in order to further secure these rights and strengthen our ability to defend against third parties who may infringe on our rights. Additionally, we protect our proprietary rights through agreements with our commercial partners, supply-chain vendors, employees, and consultants, as well as close monitoring of the developments and products in the industry. 
As of January 2023, we had 135 issued patents (130 U.S. and 5 international), 125 pending applications (61 U.S. and 64 international), of which one U.S. application has been allowed. In addition, we have three registered U.S. trademarks, 22 registered foreign trademarks and 70 pending trademark applications. 
Manufacturing Process
We build and design certain critical components in-house, including our receiver ASIC and InGaAs photodiode. We have an internal advanced manufacturing line located in Orlando, Florida, where we develop the manufacturing and testing processes, including capturing any related intellectual property necessary to develop our products. Our manufacturing processes and knowledge are a key differentiator for us in the market. 
Extended component lead times and bottlenecks in the supply chain have created supply challenges for the entire market in the past and may continue through 2023 or beyond. 
In May 2021, we announced our series manufacturing partnerships with Celestica and Fabrinet. We are in process of installing our high-volume series production facility in Mexico, which will be operated by Celestica. We expect to start production at the high-volume facility in the second half of 2023. In the meantime, we are currently producing our Iris sensors at an existing facility owned and operated by Celestica.
Research and Development 
Our research and development activities occur in various locations in the United States, Germany and India.
Our research and development team is responsible for creating new technologies and expanding lidar and perception and mapping software functionality. The team is responsible for ensuring our lidar is designed for manufacturability and testability. The team partners with our operations and supply chain functions to develop scalable commercial and reliable manufacturing processes and direct production material procurement. 
Sales and Marketing 
We use customer feedback to specifically tailor our product and approach to build and expand our relationships with potential commercial partners. In parallel, marketing and communications drive our brand equity and narrative through ongoing announcements, campaigns, events, speaking opportunities, and public relations efforts. 
The automotive value chain characteristically involves research and feasibility studies, followed by long-term product development cycles, including testing and qualification with the automakers which can last for several years. In general, automaker agreements do not guarantee potential volumes, which vehicle models will incorporate supplier components, or timing of purchases to their suppliers during this product development cycle. Instead, typically, after initial research and feasibility agreements and extensive competitive negotiations, automakers enter into development agreements that establish collaborations or partnerships to develop and integrate technology into the automaker’s vehicles or platforms intended for series production, frequently accompanied by non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) projects. While these collaboration or partnership agreements provide automakers the right to terminate the relationship without purchasing any production volume, factors such as difficulty of integrating complex technologies, sunken costs relating to NRE projects, impact on product roadmap, time to market, and risk of being unable to secure future supply may deter automakers to cancel collaboration or development agreements. Automakers typically only enter into blanket purchase orders or other definitive supply agreements with binding commitments several months before production is expected to begin. We identify major commercial wins only when we have entered into a collaboration, development, partnership or other similar agreement and have reason to believe that such engagement is expected to result in future series production. Given the customary business practices in the automotive industry, there remains potential risk that our major commercial wins may not ultimately generate any significant revenue (See Item 1A, Risk Factors for definition of major commercial win and further discussion of risk).
Government Regulation 
Automotive safety regulation in the area of autonomy is split between two categories: (1) SAE Level 0-2 (including active safety, driver assist, and conditional autonomy); and (2) SAE Level 3-5 (partial through full autonomy) (commonly referred to as “higher autonomy”). In general, throughout the world, there is a positive legal environment that encourages consumer sale and use of SAE Level 0-2 functionality. The legal environment for SAE Level 3-5 functionality varies, generally encouraging the safe testing and development of higher autonomy functions, but restricting consumer use in personal vehicles and commercial use, as in automated trucking and taxis in many regions.
In the U.S., at both the federal and state level, nearly all SAE Level 0-2 functionality is permitted, while SAE Level 3-5 enjoys a positive environment for on-road testing and development, but mixed opportunities to deploy in consumer and commercial use. Federal regulation does not prohibit higher levels of autonomy today, but if National Highway Traffic Safety Administration deems an autonomy system unsafe, it would order a recall to remove vehicles from the road. Thus far, several U.S. states have expressly permitted SAE Level 4-5 levels of autonomy, while many remain silent, and others have laws that limit driverless operation. We believe regulations related to automotive autonomy technologies will continue to evolve to remove hurdles as state and federal regulators gain more experience with the technology. 
In Europe, China, and the rest of the world, most automotive safety is regulated by a common system under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE). Under current UN/ECE standards, SAE Level 0-2 functionality may be deployed with certain restrictions such as road type and with driver monitoring, but higher SAE Level 3-5 functionality is limited to testing only. Safety regulators continue to work on standards for autonomy, but we expect this development process to be slower than in the U.S. However, China has increasingly departed from the common UN/ECE standards and is more likely to create its own regulation allowing higher levels of autonomy in the nearer term with a timeline more aligned with the U.S.
Given the intense work in these regulatory areas, there is a positive environment for deploying our lidar technology and Proactive SafetyTM today in SAE Level 0-2 systems. While there is risk that SAE Level 3-5 systems may be delayed by regulation in some countries, we expect a workable path forward over the next several years as a more permissive regulatory and political environment develops.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2022, excluding contractors, we had almost 600 full-time employees primarily in the United States and Germany. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. 
Corporate Social Responsibilities and Sustainability 
We are committed to active and responsible corporate citizenship. Our Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) program is divided into seven elements (diversity and inclusion; human resources; finance/accounting; responsible sourcing; environmental, health and safety; trade compliance; and business ethics), each spearheaded by company leaders and subject matter experts in their respective areas. We expect ADAS and automated driving technologies to provide strong social benefits including reducing roadway injuries and fatalities, including in urban areas, making roadways more efficient by reducing commuting times and CO2 emissions, and offering improved productivity.
