government customers rely on our solutions to help evaluate equipment during selection, optimize and harden their network designs in labs prior to roll-out, and once rolled out, continuously monitor the production network to ensure optimal performance and security of the contents flowing through it. Our security solutions are also used by major organizations to address the new generation of cyber warfare and defend against massive cyber-attacks.
No single customer represented 10 percent or more of the group’s net revenue.
Ixia Solutions Group Competition
The market for providing network test and monitoring systems is highly competitive. We currently compete with network test and monitoring solution vendors such as Spirent Communications, Gigamon and NetScout. We also compete either directly or indirectly with large Ethernet switch vendors and network management, analysis, compliance and test tool vendors that offer point solutions that address a subset of the issues that we solve. Additionally, some of our significant customers have developed or may develop competitive in-house products for their own use or for sale to others.
Within our network test and visibility solutions, we offer a wide range of products and related software. We compete with these solutions primarily on the basis of differentiated capability, first-to-market leading-edge technology, product quality and long-term value to our customers.
The following discussions of Research and Development, Sales, Manufacturing, Marketing, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental and Acquisition of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.
Research and Development
We are committed to investing in research and development ("R&D") and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position the company for growth. Our R&D efforts focus on development of first-to-market solutions with differentiated technology to support new software and hardware product introductions and improvements to existing software and hardware products to provide complete customer solutions aligned to our industry. We conduct R&D in four principal areas: enabling technologies, system design, simulation and measurement. Our R&D seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software and hardware systems, electronics and solution delivery. R&D investments are focused on delivering technology and first-to-market solutions, as well as building a strong foundation for future solutions over a longer time horizon. Our primary technology development centers are in California, Colorado, Georgia and Texas in the United States and in China, Finland, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Romania, Singapore, Spain and U.K. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuous flow of innovative, high-quality software, customer solutions, products and services. 
Sales 
Our direct sales force focuses on addressing the needs of our global and regional customers by selling Keysight products, systems, solutions and services. Keysight’s direct sales force consists of sales and application engineers who have in‑depth knowledge of the customers’ business and technology needs. Our direct sellers concentrate on providing more complex, end-to-end solutions where customers require strategic consultation. Our application engineers bring deep solution and application expertise to provide a combination of consulting, systems integration and software engineering services that span all stages of the sale, deployment and support of our complex systems and solutions. Our direct sales organizations serve customers globally across the commercial communications, aerospace, defense and government, automotive and energy, semiconductor, general electronics, network test and network visibility markets.
To complement our direct sales force, we have an extensive network of channel partners around the world. These channel partners include resellers, manufacturer’s representatives and distributors. They serve thousands of customers across a wide range of end-user markets. They are expected to provide the same level of service and support as our direct sales force for the products they sell and generate new sales opportunities to extend our reach. Electronic commerce and tele‑sales channels are also in place for transactional, lower-touch sales.
For certain verticals such as network monitoring and performance management, our go-to-market solution strategy is based on strategic relationships with technical partners to provide the customer with a complete solution. In these cases, we work with technical partners in two main ways: (i) through customer referrals and recommendations and (ii) through automation integration/interoperability that provides a differentiated solution for our customers.
Manufacturing 
To maximize our productivity and our ability to respond to market conditions, we have significant in-house manufacturing capabilities that are supplemented by contract manufacturers. Our in-house manufacturing efforts are focused on the highest value added, more complex and highly technical aspects of production, and we use contract manufacturers for assembly, printed circuit board production, metal die-casting and plastic moulding. Our largest manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia focuses on the final assembly of our most sophisticated instruments and, on final tuning, calibration and test of instruments across the broader portfolio. We also operate three technology centers in Santa Rosa, California; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Boeblingen, Germany that collectively provide key components and sub‑systems for our instruments, including microwave monolithic integrated circuits, thick and thin film circuits, optical components, high-speed probes and precision machining. Our technology centers provide a competitive advantage by developing and manufacturing differentiated technology components with performance levels that are not available commercially.
We have manufacturing facilities in California and Colorado in the United States. Outside of the United States, we have manufacturing centralized in Malaysia with other manufacturing facilities in China, Germany, Japan and Finland.
We generally manufacture products after we have received firm orders for delivery and do not generally hold large stocks of finished inventory.
Marketing
We have several ongoing programs to support the sale and distribution of our solutions and to inform existing and potential customers, partners and distributors about the capabilities and benefits of our expansive solutions and services portfolio. We are modernizing our marketing platforms to increase focus on lead generation for top growth segments, including broad territory customers. We continue to invest in improving the Keysight brand recognition in strategic industries, such as automotive and commercial communications, and geographies, including the greater San Francisco area, Germany, Shanghai, and Nagoya. Our marketing efforts promote the Keysight business through participating in industry trade shows and technical conferences, sponsoring technical seminars and webinars that highlight our solutions, and advertising in digital media publications and physical locations. Additionally, we write and distribute various forms of marketing collateral including brochures, white papers, application notes, solutions briefs and articles for online and print journals. Finally, we communicate to our existing and potential customers through our corporate website and various social media outlets, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and our corporate blog.
Backlog
Backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue, and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced, awaiting acceptance by customers and/or completion of a commitment to a customer.
At October 31, 2019, our unfilled backlog was approximately $1,380 million, as compared to approximately $1,311 million at October 31, 2018. Our unfilled backlog as of October 31, 2019 reflects the impact of the deferred revenue adjustment related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers ("ASC 606"). See Note 2, "New Accounting Pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Consistent with our strategy, we are seeing an increase in solution sales, which have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle; however, we expect that the majority of unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months. While backlog on any particular date can be an indicator of short-term revenue performance, it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.
Intellectual Property 
We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. Although we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material, other than the Keysight mark. 
Materials 
Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials, such as plastic resins and sheet metal. We purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address the potential disruption in, and other risks related to, our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of 

solutions for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Environmental
Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated, and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.
Some of our properties are undergoing remediation by HP Inc. ("HP") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of Agilent’s separation from HP in 1999. In connection with Agilent’s separation from HP, HP and Agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which HP agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. Agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to Keysight in respect of facilities transferred to Keysight in our separation from Agilent on November 1, 2014 (the "Separation"). As a result, HP has access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation. Although HP agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at such properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. In connection with the Separation, Agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that Agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations.
In connection with the Separation, Agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from Agilent to us. We cannot be sure that Agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations.
We maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy that may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.
Acquisition of Material Assets
On April 18, 2017, pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated January 30, 2017, between Keysight and Ixia (the "Merger Agreement"), we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Ixia for $1,622 million, net of $72 million of cash acquired, pursuant to an exchange offer for $19.65 per share (the "Merger Consideration").
