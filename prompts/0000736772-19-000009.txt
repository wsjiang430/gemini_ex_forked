ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
CNB Financial Corporation (the “Corporation”) is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). It was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1983 for the purpose of engaging in the business of a financial holding company. On April 26, 1984, the Corporation acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of County National Bank, a national banking chartered institution. In December 2006, County National Bank changed its name to CNB Bank (the "Bank"), and became a state bank chartered in Pennsylvania and subject to regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In October 2013, the Corporation acquired FC Banc Corp. and its subsidiary, The Farmers Citizens Bank. In July 2016, the Corporation acquired Lake National Bank.
In addition to the Bank, the Corporation has four other subsidiaries. CNB Securities Corporation is incorporated in Delaware and currently maintains investments in debt and equity securities. CNB Insurance Agency, incorporated in Pennsylvania, provides for the sale of nonproprietary annuities and other insurance products. CNB Risk Management, Inc. is a Delaware-based captive insurance company which insures against certain risks unique to the operations of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today's insurance marketplace. Holiday Financial Services Corporation, incorporated in Pennsylvania, offers small balance unsecured loans and secured loans, primarily collateralized by automobiles and equipment, to borrowers with higher risk characteristics.
CNB Bank
The Bank was originally chartered as a national bank in 1934 and is now a a Pennsylvania-chartered bank. In February 2017, the Bank completed construction of a full-service branch location in Duncansville, Pennsylvania and concurrently closed its loan production office in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. The full-service branch is being operated as part of the CNB Bank franchise.
ERIEBANK, a division of the Bank, began operations in 2005. In July 2016, the Corporation acquired Lake National Bank, which operated two full-service branches in Mentor, Ohio, approximately 20 miles east of Cleveland, Ohio. The Bank is continuing to operate these two branch locations within its ERIEBANK franchise. In February 2017, the Corporation completed construction of a full-service branch location in Ashtabula, Ohio, which is also operating within the ERIEBANK franchise.
In October 2013, the Corporation acquired FC Banc Corp. and its subsidiary, Farmers Citizens Bank. In 2017, the Bank sold its Mount Hope branch of FCBank to First Federal Community Bank of Dover, Ohio. The Bank currently operates seven branch locations as FCBank, a division of the Bank, with its headquarters in Worthington, Ohio.
In 2016, the Bank received regulatory approval to conduct business in the state of New York as BankOnBuffalo, a division of the Bank. The Bank opened a loan production office in Buffalo, New York in May 2016, which was closed in February 2017 concurrent opening of a full-service location in downtown Buffalo in February 2017. The Bank opened full-service locations in Williamsville, New York and Orchard Park, New York in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a full-service location in Niagara Falls, New York in the third quarter of 2018.
The Bank has 42 full-service branch offices located in various communities in its market area. The Bank’s primary market area includes the Pennsylvania counties of Blair, Cambria, Cameron, Centre, Clearfield, Crawford, Elk, Indiana, Jefferson, and McKean. ERIEBANK, a division of the Bank, operates in the Pennsylvania counties of Crawford, Erie, and Warren and the Ohio counties of Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, and Lake.

Holiday Financial Services Corporation
In 2005, the Corporation entered the consumer discount loan and finance business, which is conducted through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Holiday Financial Services Corporation ("Holiday"). Holiday currently has nine offices within the Corporation’s market area.
Competition
The financial services industry in the Corporation’s service area continues to be extremely competitive, both among commercial banks and with other financial service providers such as consumer finance companies, thrifts, investment firms, mutual funds and credit unions. The increased competition has resulted from changes in the legal and regulatory guidelines as well as from economic conditions. Mortgage banking firms, leasing companies, financial affiliates of industrial companies, brokerage firms, retirement fund management firms, and even government agencies provide additional competition for loans and other financial services. Some of the financial service providers operating in the Corporation’s market area operate on a large-scale regional or national basis and possess resources greater than those of the Corporation. The Corporation is generally competitive with all competing financial institutions in its service area with respect to interest rates paid on time and savings deposits, service charges on deposit accounts and interest rates charged on loans.
Supervision and Regulation
The Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status, and the Bank is a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, the Corporation is subject to the oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and is regulated under the BHC Act, and the Bank is subject to the oversight of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as its primary federal regulator. The Corporation and the Bank are also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, such as requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types, amounts and terms and conditions of loans that may be granted, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may be offered. Various consumer financial protection laws and regulations also affect the operation of the Bank and, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) is authorized to write rules on consumer financial products and services which could affect the operations of the Bank and Holiday. In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial banks are significantly affected by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board, including actions taken with respect to interest rates, as the Federal Reserve Board attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in the U.S. in order to influence the economy.
The following summary sets forth certain of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information about us and our subsidiaries. It does not describe all of the provisions of the statutes, regulations and policies that are identified. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business.
Bank Holding Company Regulation
As a bank holding company that controls a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank, the Corporation is subject to regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the Federal Reserve Board. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHC Act, and applicable regulations. For instance, the BHC Act requires each bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire substantially all the assets of any bank, or before it may acquire ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than five percent of any class of voting shares of such bank. Such a transaction may also require approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking.
Pursuant to provisions of the BHC Act and regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board thereunder, the Corporation may only engage in, or own companies that engage in, activities deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be permissible for bank holding companies or financial holding companies. Activities permissible for bank holding companies are those that are so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Permissible activities for financial holding companies include those “so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto” as well as certain additional activities deemed “financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity” or complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of the depository institution or the financial system.

The Corporation must obtain permission from or provide notice to the Federal Reserve Board prior to engaging in most new business activities.
Regulation of CNB Bank
Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern, among other things, the scope of a bank’s business, the investments a bank may make, the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain, the loans a bank makes and collateral it takes, the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and acquisitions, the establishment of branches, management practices, and numerous other aspects of banking operations.
Source of Strength Doctrine
Under Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the Federal Reserve Board’s policy that in serving as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility, and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice, a violation of the Federal Reserve Board regulations, or both. This doctrine is commonly known as the “source of strength” doctrine.
Identity Theft
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (together with the SEC, the “Commissions”) jointly issued final rules and guidelines to require certain regulated entities to establish programs to address risks of identity theft. The rules and guidelines implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These provisions amend Section 615(e) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and directed the Commissions to adopt rules requiring entities that are subject to the Commissions’ jurisdiction to address identity theft in two ways. First, the rules require financial institutions and creditors to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program that is designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with certain existing accounts or the opening of new accounts. The rules include guidelines to assist entities in the formulation and maintenance of programs that would satisfy the requirements of the rules. Second, the rules establish special requirements for any credit and debit card issuers that are subject to the Commissions’ jurisdiction, to assess the validity of notifications of changes of address under certain circumstances.
Capital Adequacy
The Capital Rules adopted in 2013 by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, generally implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital framework, referred to as Basel III, for strengthening international capital standards. The Capital Rules revise the definitions and components of regulatory capital, increase risk-based capital requirements, and make selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The risk-weighting categories in the Capital Rules are standardized and include a risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of assets.
The Capital Rules, among other things:

• | revise minimum capital requirements and adjust prompt corrective action thresholds;


• | revise the components of regulatory capital, including adding a new minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets and increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement from 4% to 6%;


• | retain the existing risk-based capital treatment for 1-4 family residential mortgage exposures;


• | permit most banking organizations to retain, through a one-time permanent election, the existing capital treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income;


• | implement the capital conservation buffer beginning January 1, 2016, which was phased in incrementally until it reached 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, in addition to the minimum common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, on January 1, 2019;


• | require a minimum leverage ratio of 4%;


• | require a total capital ratio of 8%;

 3


• | increase capital requirements for past-due loans, high volatility commercial real estate exposures, and certain short-term loan commitments;


• | require the deduction of mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that exceed 10% of common equity Tier 1 capital in each category and 15% of common equity Tier 1 capital in the aggregate; and


• | remove references to credit ratings consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act and establish due diligence requirements for securitization exposures.

Compliance with the Capital Rules was required beginning January 1, 2015, for most banking organizations including the Corporation, subject to a transition period for several aspects of the final rules, including the new minimum capital ratio requirements, the capital conservation buffer, and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions. The Corporation implemented the Capital Rules on January 1, 2015, and continues to exceed all estimated well-capitalized regulatory requirements on a fully phased-in basis.
In November 2017, the Federal Reserve Board finalized a rule extending the currently applicable capital rules for mortgage servicing assists and certain other items for non-advanced approaches institutions. This rule is in effect pending the comment period and review of the general proposal to simplify the Capital Rules for non-advanced approaches institutions.
Dividend Restrictions
The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Declaration and payment of cash dividends depends upon cash dividend payments to the Corporation by the Bank, which is our primary source of revenue and cash flow. Accordingly, the right of the Corporation, and consequently the right of our creditors and shareholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the Bank, except to the extent that claims of the Corporation in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized.
As a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment and amounts of dividends under the Pennsylvania Banking Code. Further, the ability of banking subsidiaries to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements.
The payment of dividends by the Bank and the Corporation may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory requirements. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. A depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if the regulators deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice.
Prompt Corrective Action and Safety and Soundness
Under applicable “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) statutes and regulations, depository institutions are placed into one of five capital categories, ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.” The PCA statute and regulations provide for progressively more stringent supervisory measures as an insured depository institution’s capital category declines. An institution that is not well capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market. An undercapitalized depository institution must submit an acceptable restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency. One requisite element of such a plan is that the institution’s parent holding company must guarantee compliance by the institution with the plan, subject to certain limitations.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank qualified as “well capitalized” under applicable regulatory capital standards.
Bank holding companies and insured depository institutions may also be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the agency, or term of a written agreement with the agency. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include the issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors, and other institution affiliated parties; the termination of the insured depository institution’s deposit insurance; the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the insured depository institution; and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the FDIC, as receiver, would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.

Community Reinvestment Act
Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), the FDIC is required to assess the record of all financial institutions it supervises to determine if these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the community (including low and moderate income neighborhoods) which they serve. CRA performance evaluations are based on a four-tiered rating system: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve and Substantial Noncompliance. CRA performance evaluations are considered in evaluating applications for such things as mergers, acquisitions and applications to open branches. The Bank received a CRA rating of “Satisfactory” at its most recent CRA exam.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
The Bank is subject to the restrictions of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the implementing Regulation W. The Bank's "affiliates" for purposes of these sections include, among other potential entities, the Corporation and its direct subsidiaries. Section 23A requires that loans or extensions of credit by the Bank to an affiliate, purchases by the Bank of securities issued by an affiliate, purchases by the Bank of assets from an affiliate (except as may be exempted by order or regulation), the Bank’s acceptance of securities or debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of the credit to a third party, the Bank’s acceptance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate, a transaction with an affiliate involving the borrowing or lending of securities to the extent the transaction causes the Bank to have credit exposure to the affiliate, and a derivative transaction with an affiliate, to the extent the Bank will have credit exposure to the affiliate (collectively, “Covered Transactions”) be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Section 23A also imposes quantitative restrictions on the amount of and collateralization requirements on such transactions. Section 23B requires that all Covered Transactions and certain other transactions, including the sale of securities or other assets by the Bank to an affiliate and the payment of money or the furnishing of services by the Bank to an affiliate, be on terms comparable to those prevailing for similar transactions with nonaffiliates.
The Bank is also subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, and the implementation of Regulation O issued by the Federal Reserve Board. These provisions impose limitations on loans and extensions of credit by the Bank to its and its affiliates' executive officers, directors and principal shareholders and their related interests. The limitations restrict the terms and aggregate amount of such transactions. Regulation O also imposes certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
Deposit Insurance and Premiums
The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits per insured depositor by the FDIC. The standard maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured depository institution, per ownership category, in accordance with applicable FDIC regulations.
The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based on a risk matrix that takes into account the bank’s capital level and supervisory rating. The base for insurance assessments is the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed. FDIC deposit insurance expense also includes deposit insurance assessments and FICO assessments related to outstanding FICO bonds.
Financial Privacy and Data Security
The Corporation is subject to federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain state laws containing consumer privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties and limit the reuse of certain consumer information received from non-affiliated financial institutions. These provisions require notice of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain nonpublic personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of opt-out or opt-in authorizations.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect consumer information. Federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information. Further, pursuant to interpretive guidance issued under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain state laws, financial institutions are required to notify customers of security breaches that result in unauthorized access to their nonpublic personal information.
 5

Incentive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, including the Corporation and the Bank, with at least $1 billion in total consolidated assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking agencies and the SEC most recently proposed such regulations in 2016, but the regulations have not yet been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will restrict the manner in which executive compensation is structured.
The Dodd-Frank Act also requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the date of enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on so-called “golden parachute” payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions.
USA PATRIOT Act
Under Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, all financial institutions are required to take certain measures to identify their customers, prevent money laundering, monitor customer transactions, and report suspicious activity to U.S. law enforcement agencies. Financial institutions also are required to respond to requests for information from federal banking agencies and law enforcement agencies. Information sharing among financial institutions for the above purposes is encouraged by an exemption granted to complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other privacy laws. Financial institutions that hold correspondent accounts for foreign banks or provide private banking services to foreign individuals are required to take measures to avoid dealing with certain foreign individuals or entities, including foreign banks with profiles that raise money laundering concerns, and are prohibited from dealing with foreign “shell banks” and persons from jurisdictions of particular concern. The primary federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury have adopted regulations to implement several of these provisions. All financial institutions also are required to establish internal anti-money laundering programs. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the Bank Merger Act. The Bank has in place a Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act compliance program and engages in very few transactions of any kind with foreign financial institutions or foreign persons.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The United States government has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. These are typically known as the “OFAC” rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Office of Foreign Assets Control-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Other Federal Laws and Regulations
State usury and other credit laws limit the amount of interest and various other charges collected or contracted by a bank on loans. The Bank is also subject to lending limits on loans to one borrower and regulatory guidance on concentrations of credit. The Bank’s loans and other products and services are also subject to numerous federal and state consumer financial protection laws, including, but not limited to, the following:

• | Truth-In-Lending Act, which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;


• | Truth-in-Savings Act, which governs disclosures of the terms of deposit accounts to consumers;


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to regulators to enable determinations as to whether financial institutions are fulfilling their obligations to meet the home lending needs of the communities they serve and not discriminating in their lending practices;


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, sex or other prohibited factors in extending credit;

 6


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which imposes requirements relating to real estate settlements, including requiring lenders to disclose certain information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlement services;


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act, covering numerous areas relating to certain types of consumer information and identity theft;


• | Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related regulations, which require that financial institutions provide privacy policies to consumers, to allow customers to “opt out” of certain sharing of their nonpublic personal information, and to safeguard sensitive and confidential customer information;


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act, which is a consumer protection law regarding electronic fund transfers; and


• | Numerous other federal and state laws and regulations, including those related to consumer protection and bank operations.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") is applicable to all companies with equity securities registered or that file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including publicly-held financial holding companies such as the Corporation. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes: (i) requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise, and responsibilities; (ii) additional responsibilities regarding financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (iv) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers; and (v) new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of the securities laws.
Governmental Policies
Our earnings are significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open-market operations in U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the level of inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may have on our business and earnings.
Other Legislative Initiatives
Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress, in the Pennsylvania Legislature, and/or by various bank regulatory authorities that could alter the powers of, and restrictions on, different types of banking organizations and which could restructure part or all of the existing regulatory framework for banks, bank and financial holding companies and other providers of financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced in Congress which would further regulate, deregulate or restructure the financial services industry, including proposals to substantially reform the regulatory framework. It is not possible to predict whether any such proposals will be enacted into law or, even if enacted, what effect such action may have on our business and earnings.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had a total of 556 employees, of which 505 were full time and 51 were part time.
