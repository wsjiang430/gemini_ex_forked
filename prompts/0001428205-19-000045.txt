Item 1. Business
References to “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company” are to ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. (“ARMOUR”) and its subsidiaries. References to “ACM” are to ARMOUR Capital Management LP, a Delaware limited partnership. Refer to the Glossary of Terms for definitions of capitalized terms and abbreviations used in this report. 
Our Company
ARMOUR is an externally managed Maryland corporation incorporated in 2008. The Company is managed by ACM, an investment advisor registered with the SEC (see Note 11 and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). 
We invest in residential mortgage backed securities issued or guaranteed by a United States (“U.S.”) Government-sponsored entity (“GSE”), such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), or a government agency such as Government National Mortgage Administration (Ginnie Mae) (collectively, “Agency Securities”). The Agency securities in our securities portfolio consist primarily of fixed rate home loans, the remaining are either backed by hybrid adjustable rate or adjustable rate home loans. Other securities backed by residential mortgages in which we invest, for which the payment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or government agency, may benefit from credit enhancement derived from structural elements such as subordination, over collateralization or insurance (collectively, “Credit Risk and Non-Agency Securities”). We also invest in Interest-Only Securities, which are the interest portion of Agency Securities, that is separated and sold individually from the principal portion of the same payment.("Agency Securities" together with “Credit Risk and Non-Agency Securities” and Interest-Only Securities, collectively, "MBS"). From time to time we may also invest in U.S. Treasury Securities and money market instruments.
We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (“the Code”). Our qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the concentration of ownership of our capital stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and our manner of operations enables us to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on the REIT taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income.
Our Strategies
We seek to create shareholder value through thoughtful investment and risk management that produces current yield and superior risk adjusted returns over the long term. Our focus on residential real estate finance supports home ownership for a broad and diverse spectrum of Americans by bringing private capital into the mortgage markets. 
Our Assets
Since our formation, our assets have been invested in MBS, U.S. Treasury Securities and money market instruments.
Our Borrowings
We borrow against our MBS using repurchase agreements. Our borrowings generally have maturities that may range from one month or less, up to one year, although occasionally we may enter into longer dated borrowing agreements.. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our total repurchase indebtedness was approximately $7,037,651 and $7,555,917, respectively, with a weighted average maturity of 14 days and 51 days, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, BUCKLER Securities, LLC, "BUCKLER" (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements) accounted for 49.8% and 38.4%, respectively, of our aggregate borrowings Our borrowings (on a recourse basis) are generally between six and ten times the amount of our total stockholders’ equity, but we are not limited to that range. The level of our borrowings may vary periodically depending on market conditions. In addition, certain of our MRAs and master swap agreements contain a restriction that prohibits our leverage from exceeding twelve times our total stockholders’ equity as well as termination events in the case of significant reductions in equity capital.
Our Hedging
We use derivatives in the normal course of our business to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cost of funding consistent with our REIT tax requirements. These techniques primarily consist of entering into interest rate swap contracts, basis swaps and swaptions and purchasing or selling Futures Contracts and may also include entering into interest rate cap or floor agreements, purchasing put and call options on securities or securities underlying Futures Contracts, or entering into forward rate agreements. Although we are not legally limited to our use of hedging, we intend to limit our use of derivative instruments to only those techniques described above and to enter into derivative transactions only with counterparties that we believe have a strong credit rating to help limit the risk of counterparty default or insolvency. These transactions are not entered into for speculative purposes. 
To the extent that changes in the swap and futures rates correlate with changes in mortgage rates, changes in the fair values of our derivatives will tend to offset changes in the fair values of our MBS. The actual extent of such offset will depend on the relative size of our portfolios of derivatives and MBS and the actual correlation of rate changes. However, changes in the fair value of our derivatives are reported in net income, while changes in the fair values of our Agency Securities are reported directly in our total stockholders’ equity. Therefore, earnings reported in accordance with GAAP will fluctuate even in situations where our derivatives are operating as intended. As a result of this mark-to-market accounting treatment, our reported results of operations are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used cash flow hedge accounting. Comparisons with companies that use cash flow hedge accounting for all or part of their derivative activities may not be meaningful.
Our Manager
The Company is managed by ACM, pursuant to management agreements with ARMOUR and JAVELIN (see Note 11 and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). ACM manages our day-to-day operations, subject to the direction and oversight of the Board. The ARMOUR management agreement runs through June 18, 2024 and is thereafter automatically renewed for successive five-year terms unless terminated under certain circumstances. JAVELIN also has a management agreement with ACM, with a base management fee of one dollar that will continue to automatically renew unless terminated under certain circumstances. Either party must provide 180 days prior written notice of any such termination.
The ARMOUR management agreement entitles ACM to receive management fees payable monthly in arrears. The monthly ARMOUR management fee is 1/12th of the sum of (a) 1.5% of gross equity raised up to $1.0 billion plus (b) 0.75% of gross equity raised in excess of $1.0 billion. The cost of repurchased stock and liquidation distributions as approved and so designated by a majority of the Board will reduce the amount of gross equity raised used to calculate the monthly management fee. At December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the effective management fees were 1.03%, 1.04% and 1.05% based on gross equity raised of $2,658,969, $2,618,020
and $2,469,368, respectively. The ACM monthly management fees are not calculated based on the performance of our assets. Accordingly, the payment of our monthly management fees may not decline in the event of a decline in our earnings and may cause us to incur losses. ACM is further entitled to receive termination fees under certain circumstances. Our total management fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $27,246 compared to $26,582 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $26,070 for the year ended December 31, 2016.
We are required to take actions as may be reasonably required to permit and enable ACM to carry out its duties and obligations. We are also responsible for any costs and expenses that ACM incurred solely on our behalf other than the various overhead expenses specified in the terms of the management agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we reimbursed ACM $206, $764 and $1,950, respectively for other expenses incurred on our behalf. In 2013 and 2017, we elected to make restricted stock unit awards to our executive officers and other ACM employees through ACM that vest over 5 years. In November 2017, we elected to make restricted stock unit awards to the Board. We recognized stock based compensation expense of $436, $339 and $470 for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements).
Other Activities
If ACM and the Board determine that additional funding is advisable, we may raise such funds through equity offerings (including preferred equity), unsecured debt securities, convertible securities (including warrants, preferred equity and debt) or the retention of cash flow (subject to provisions in the Code concerning taxability of undistributed REIT taxable income) or a combination of these methods.
In 2017, we contributed $352 for a 10% ownership interest in BUCKLER a Delaware limited liability company and a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer, controlled by ACM and certain executive officers of ARMOUR. In 2018, we made additional contributions to BUCKLER of $133. BUCKLER, began trading operations in the fourth quarter 2017 (see Note 9 and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). 
In the event that ACM and the Board determine that we should raise additional equity capital, we have the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue additional stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as we deem appropriate, at any time. At December 31, 2018, there were 81,297 authorized shares of common stock and 8,710 authorized shares of preferred stock available for issuance. At December 31, 2018, there were 1,874 authorized shares remaining available for repurchase under our Repurchase Program.
See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for shares issued subsequent to December 31, 2018. 
Real Estate Investment Trust Requirements
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on the REIT taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders. We also must satisfy other ongoing REIT requirements under the Code, including meeting certain asset, income and stock ownership tests. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income.
Distributions
In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we are required to timely distribute, with respect to each year at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. To satisfy these requirements, we presently intend to continue to make regular cash distributions of all or substantially all of our taxable income to holders of our stock 
out of assets legally available for such purposes. We are not restricted from using the proceeds of equity or debt offerings to pay dividends, but we do not intend to do so. The timing and amount of any dividends we pay to holders of our stock will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon various factors, including our earnings and financial condition, maintenance of REIT status, applicable provisions of MGCL and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. Dividends in excess of REIT taxable income for the year (including taxable income carried forward from the previous year) will generally not be taxable to common stockholders. The portion of the dividends on our common stock which represented non-taxable return of capital was approximately 83.2% in 2018, 89.0% in 2017, and 81.6% in 2016.
Investment Company Act of 1940 Exclusion
We conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. We rely on the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act as interpreted by the staff of the SEC. To qualify for this exclusion we must invest at least 55% of our assets in “mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate” or “qualifying real estate interests” and at least 80% of our assets in qualifying real estate interests and “real estate related assets.” In satisfying this 55% requirement we treat MBS issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgage loans in which we hold all of the certificates issued by the pool (“whole pool” securities) as qualifying real estate interests. We currently treat MBS in which we hold less than all of the certificates issued by the pool (“partial pool” securities) as real estate related assets and not qualifying real estate interests. 
There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the 1940 Act status of REITs, including guidance and interpretations from the SEC staff regarding the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations or business. For example, such changes might require us to employ less leverage in financing certain of our mortgage related investments and we may be precluded from acquiring certain types of higher yielding securities. The net effect of these factors would be to lower our net interest income. If we fail to qualify for an exclusion from registration as an investment company or an exclusion from the definition of an investment company, our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced. Our business will be materially and adversely affected if we fail to qualify for an exclusion from regulation under the 1940 Act.
Compliance with NYSE Corporate Governance Standards

We comply with the corporate governance standards of the NYSE. Our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are comprised entirely of independent directors and a majority of our directors are “independent” in accordance with the rules of the NYSE.
Competition
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets with favorable margins over our borrowing costs. In acquiring MBS, we compete with mortgage REITs, mortgage finance and specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, other lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. Many of these organizations have greater financial resources and access to lower costs of capital than we do. Some of these entities may not be subject to the same regulatory constraints that we are (i.e., REIT compliance or maintaining an exclusion under the 1940 Act). In addition, there are numerous mortgage REITs with similar asset acquisition objectives, including MBS and others may be organized in the future. The effect of the existence of additional REITs may be to increase competition for the available supply of mortgage assets suitable for purchase. An increase in competition for financing could adversely affect the availability and cost of our financing.
