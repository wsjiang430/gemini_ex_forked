Company Background – Business Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Utah on October 4, 1985, under the name of Mormon Mint, Inc. The corporation was originally a startup company organized to manufacture and market commemorative medallions related to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. On January 5, 1999, Bekam Investments, Ltd. acquired one hundred percent of the common shares of the Company and spun the Company off changing its name Converge Global, Inc. From August 13, 1999 until November 20, 2002, the Company focused on the development and implementation of Internet web content and e-commerce applications. From 2009 to 2014, we operated primarily in the mining exploration business. In 2015, we left the mining business and began an internet-based marketing business focused on offerings from our “Majestic Menu” food service items offered to the hospitality and food service industry via an on-line internet site, where individuals could purchase retail direct from food distributors via credit cards and commercial accounts.
 On September 4, 2015, Donald Steinberg and Charles Larsen purchased 400,000,000 shares of restricted common stock and 10,000,000 shares of the Preferred Class A stock from the Company’s President, Cornelia Volino, in exchange for $105,000.00. On September 9, 2015, Donald Steinberg was appointed Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Company. Mr. Larsen was appointed to the Board of Directors. The former officers and directors of the Company resigned concurrent with the new appointments. By virtue of Messrs. Steinberg and Larsen’s stock purchase and appointment to the Company’s Board of Directors, a purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business and a corresponding change of control occurred. The Company reported the change of control in its September 30, 2015 quarterly report filed with the OTC Markets. Thereafter, the Company’s business plans and operations changed to focus on cannabis and legalized hemp more fully discussed in this filing. The Company changed its name to Marijuana Company of America, Inc. and trading symbol on December 1, 2015.
 
Marijuana Company of America Inc. and subsidiaries is a publicly listed company quoted on OTC Markets OTCQB Tier under the symbol “MCOA”. We are based in Escondido, California.

Joint Ventures and Investments
 
Our business also includes participating and making selected investments in other related new businesses. Currently, we have made investments in startup ventures, including:
 

Bougainville Ventures, Inc. Joint Venture; On March 16, 2017,
we entered into a joint venture agreement with Bougainville Ventures, Inc., a Canadian corporation. The purpose of the joint venture
was for the Company and Bougainville to jointly engage in the development and promotion of products in the legalized cannabis industry
in Washington State; (ii) utilize Bougainville's high quality cannabis grow operations in the State of Washington, where
it claimed to have an ownership interest in real property for use within the legalized cannabis industry; (iii) leverage Bougainville’s
agreement with a I502 Tier 3 license holder to grow cannabis on the site; provide technical and management services and resources
including, but not limited to: sales and marketing, agricultural procedures, operations security and monitoring, processing and
delivery, branding, capital resources and financial management; and, (iv) optimize collaborative business opportunities. The Company
and Bougainville agreed to operate through a Washington State Limited Liability Company, and BV-MCOA Management, LLC was organized in
the State of Washington on May 16, 2017.

As our contribution to the joint venture, the Company committed to raise not less than $1 million dollars to fund joint venture operations based upon a funding schedule. The Company also committed to providing branding and systems for the representation of cannabis related products and derivatives comprised of management, marketing and various proprietary methodologies directly tailored to the cannabis industry.
 
Bougainville represented that it had an ownership interest in real property located in Washington State used for growing cannabis, and possessed information primarily related to the management and control of cannabis grow operations as conducted in Washington State that included research, development and know how in the cannabis industry. Bougainville also represented that it had an agreement with a I502 Tier 3 license holder in Washington State to operate on the land. The Company and Bougainville's agreement provided that funding provided by the Company would go, in part, towards the joint venture’s ultimate purchase of the land consisting of a one-acre parcel located in Okanogan County, Washington, for joint venture operations.
 As disclosed on Form 8-K on December 11, 2017, the Company did not comply with the funding schedule for the joint venture. On November 6, 2017, the Company and Bougainville amended the joint venture agreement to reduce the amount of the Company's commitment to $800,000 and also required the Company to issue Bougainville 15 million shares of the Company's restricted common stock. The Company completed its payments pursuant to the amended agreement on November 7, 2017, and on November 9, 2017, issued to Bougainville 15 million shares of restricted common stock. The amended agreement provided that Bougainville would deed the real property to the joint venture within thirty days of its receipt of payment.
 
Thereafter, the Company determined that Bougainville had no ownership interest in the property in Washington State, but rather was a party to a purchase agreement for real property that was in breach for non-payment. Bougainville also did not possess an agreement with a Tier 3 I502 license holder to grow Marijuana on the property. Nonetheless, as a result of funding arranged for by the Company, Bougainville and an unrelated third party, Green Ventures Capital Corp., purchased the land. The land is currently pending the payment of delinquent property taxes that would allow for the Okanogan County Assessor to sub-divide the property, so that the appropriate portion could be deeded to the joint venture. Although Bougainville represented it would pay the delinquent taxes, it has not. To date, the property has not been deeded to the joint venture.
 
To clarify the respective contributions and roles of the parties, the Company also offered to enter into good faith negotiations to revise and restate the joint venture agreement with Bougainville. The Company diligently attempted to communicate with Bougainville in good faith to accomplish a revised and restated joint venture agreement, and efforts towards satisfying the conditions to complete the subdivision of the land by the Okanogan County Assessor. However, Bougainville failed to cooperate or communicate with the Company in good faith, and failed to pay the delinquent taxes on the real property that would allow for sub-division and the deeding of the real property to the joint venture. 
 
On August 10, 2018, the Company advised its independent auditor that Bougainville did not cooperate or communicate with the Company regarding its requests for information concerning the audit of Bougainville’s receipt and expenditures of funds contributed by the Company in the joint venture agreement. Bougainville had a material obligation to do so under the joint venture agreement. The Company believes that some of the funds it paid to Bougainville were misappropriated and that there was self-dealing with respect to those funds. Additionally, the Company believes that Bougainville misrepresented material facts in the joint venture agreement, as amended, including, but not limited to, Bougainville’s representations that: (i) it had an ownership interest in real property that was to be deeded to the joint venture; (ii) it had an agreement with a Tier 3 # I502 cannabis license holder to grow cannabis on the real property; and, (iii) that clear title to the real property associated with the Tier 3 # I502 license would be deeded to the joint venture thirty days after the Company made its final funding contribution. As a result, on September 20, 2018, the Company filed suit against Bougainville Ventures, Inc., BV-MCOA Management, LLC, Andy Jagpal, Richard Cindric, et al. in Okanogan County Washington Superior Court, case number 18-2- 0045324. The Company’s complaint seeks legal and equitable relief for breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, recession of the joint venture agreement, an accounting, quiet title to real property in the name of the Company, for the appointment of a receiver, the return to treasury of 15 million shares issued to Bougainville, and, for treble damages pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act in Washington State. The registrant has filed a lis pendens on the real property. The case is currently in litigation.

In connection with the agreement, the Company recorded a cash investment of $1,188,500 to the Joint Venture during 2017. This was comprised of 49.5% ownership of BV-MCOA Management LLC, and was accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company recorded an annual impairment in 2017 of $792,500, reflecting the Company’s percentage of ownership of the net book value of the investment. During 2018, the Company recorded equity losses of $37,673 and $11,043 for the first and second quarters respectively, and recorded an annual impairment of $285,986 for the year ended December 31, 2018, at which time the Company determined the investment to be fully impaired due to Bougainville’s breach of contract, including: (i) its failure to communicate and cooperate regarding the Company’s audit; (ii) its misrepresentations concerning its ownership interest in the real property in Okanogan County Washington; (iii) its failure to deed the property to the joint venture within thirty days of payment pursuant to the amended joint venture agreement; and, (iv) its misrepresentation that it possessed an agreement with a Tier 3 license holder to operate on the property.



GateC Joint Venture; On March 17, 2017, the Company and GateC
Research, Inc. (“GateC”) entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (“Agreement”) whereby the Company committed
to raise up to one and one-half million dollars ($1,500,000) over a six-month period, with a minimum commitment of five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000) within a three (3) month period; and, information establishing brands and systems for the representation
of cannabis related products and derivatives comprised of management, marketing and various proprietary methodologies, including
but not limited to its affiliate marketing program, directly tailored to the cannabis industry.

 
GateC agreed to contribute its management and control services and systems related to cannabis grow operations in Adelanto County, California, and its permit to grow marijuana in an approved zone in Adelanto, California. GateC did not own a physical site for its operation in Adelanto County, California, and GateC’s permit to grow cannabis did not contain a conditional use permit.
 
On or about November 28, 2017, GateC and the Registrant orally agreed to suspend the Company’s funding commitment, pending the finalization of California State regulations governing the growth, cultivation and distribution of cannabis, which were expected to be completed in 2018. 
 
On March 19, 2018, the Company and GateC rescinded the Agreement and concurrently released each other from any all any and all losses, claims, debts, liabilities, demands, obligations, promises, acts, omissions, agreements, costs and expenses, damages, injuries, suits, actions and causes of action, of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, contingent or fixed, that they may have against each other and their Affiliates, arising out of the Agreement.
 
The Registrant incurred no termination penalties as the result of its entry into the Recession and Mutual Release Agreement.
 
In 2017, the Company recorded a debt obligation of $1,500,000 to the Joint Venture and a corresponding impairment charge of $1,500,000 during for year ended December 31, 2017. Upon termination of the material definitive agreement on March 19, 2018, the Company realized a gain on settlement of debt obligation of $1,500,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2018.

Conveniant Hemp Mart, LLC; Conveniant Hemp Mart, LLC is a Wyoming
limited liability company whose business plan includes the development, manufacture and sale of consumer products containing CBD
that are intended for marketing and sales at convenience stores, gas stations and markets. On July 19, 2017, we agreed to lend
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to Conveniant based on a promissory note. The note provided that in lieu of receiving repayment,
we could elect to exercise a right to convert the loaned amount into a payment towards the purchase of a 25% interest in Conveniant,
subject to our payment of an additional fifty thousand dollars [$50,000] equaling a total purchase price of $100,000. The Company
exercised this option on November 20, 2017 and made payment to Conveniant on November 21, 2017. Conveniant developed a line of
consumer products containing industrial hemp derived CBD with no traceable THC content. The product line includes tinctures that
combine industrial hemp-derived CBD with hemp seed oil, coconut oil and other essential natural oils; a muscle cream product that
combines industrial hemp-derived CBD with natural oils; a hand lotion that combines industrial hemp derived CBD with lavender oils;

Global Hemp Group, Inc. Joint Venture; On September 5, 2017,
we announced our agreement to participate in a joint venture with Global Hemp Group Inc., a Canadian corporation, in a multi-phase
industrial hemp project on the Acadian peninsula of New Brunswick, Canada. The joint venture’s goal is to develop a “Hemp
Agro-Industrial Zone”, a concept that promotes and engages farmers, processors and manufacturers to collaboratively produce
and process 100% of the hemp plant into a number of wholesale materials that can be manufactured into healthy and sustainable products.
The “HAIZ” will be surrounded by hemp production thereby minimizing the cost of expensive transportation to distant
processing facilities. The “Hemp Agro-Industrial Zone” has a goal of producing social and environmental benefits to
the communities where they operate. These zones are envisioned to prospectively create jobs for farmers, foster rural development,
provide the opportunity to develop more sustainable products of superior quality and help support Global Hemp Group’s commitment
to creating a carbon free economy. The first phase of the project involved lab testing in support of the trials. The Collège
Communautaire du Nouveau Brunswick (CCNB) in Bathurst, New Brunswick (“CCNB”) intends to assist Global Hemp Group in
research on its ongoing industrial hemp trials in the region, and to perform laboratory tests in support of these trials. These
tests will provide information to validate agronomic and key yield data in preparation of a large-scale industrial development
project that will involve processing of the full plant: grain, straw, flowers and leaves, scheduled to begin in 2018. The results
of these tests will also be used in discussions with farmers of the region to refine a hemp-based farming model, and to mobilize additional farmers for
the next growing season. Our participation included providing one-half, or $10,775 of the funding for the phase one work. On January
10, 2018, phase-one was completed by successfully cultivating industrial hemp during the 2017 growing season for research purposes.
The objective of phase one was to re-introduce hemp into the area and ensure that it could be productive under New Brunswick growing
conditions prior to significantly increasing cultivation acreage and building a hemp processing facility in the region, in future
phases of the project. As a result of our participation in the joint venture, we will share in the ownership of research and development
of hemp and CBD related studies produced by the New Brunswick Project, and, in the event Canadian laws governing the growing, harvesting,
manufacturing and production of products containing hemp and CBD change (as expected, but not guaranteed) in 2018, we would benefit
from possible preferred pricing and terms for the purchase of hemp and CBD that would enable us to further conduct its business
and research and development into hemp and CBD products. Our New Brunswick joint venture with Global Hemp
Group, Inc. is a related party transaction insofar as its director, Charles Larsen, is a beneficial owner of more than 10% of our
common stock, and was a former director of the Company, and our President and Chief Executive Officer Donald Steinberg is a shareholder
in Global Hemp Group.


Global Hemp Group Joint Venture/Scio Oregon Hemp Project; On
May 8, 2018, the Company, Global Hemp Group, Inc., a Canadian corporation, and TTO Enterprises, Ltd., an Oregon corporation entered
into a Joint Venture Agreement. The purpose of the joint venture is to develop a project to commercialize the cultivation of industrial
hemp on a 109 acre parcel of real property owned by the Company and Global Hemp Group in Scio, Oregon, and operating under the
Oregon corporation Covered Bridges, Ltd. The joint venture is in the development stage. On May 30, 2018, the joint venture purchased
TTO’s 15% interest in the joint venture for $30,000. The Company and Global Hemp Group, Inc. now have an equal 50-50 interest
in the joint venture. The joint venture agreement commits the Company to a cash contribution of $600,000 payable on the following
funding schedule: $200,000 upon execution of the joint venture agreement; $238,780 by July 31, 2018; $126,445 by October 31, 2018;
and, $34,775 by January 31, 2019. The Company has complied with its payments. The 2018 crop of hemp grown on the joint venture’s
real property consisted of 33 acres of high yielding CBD hemp grown in an orchard style cultivation on the property. The 2018 harvest
consisted of approximately 37,000 high yielding CBD hemp plants producing 24 tons of biomass that produced 48,000 pounds of dried
biomass. The joint venture partners prepared processing samples ranging in size from 100 lbs to 2,000 lbs. for sample offers to
extraction companies. The biomass is being processed into CBD crude oil with the option to refine it further into isolate, or full
spectrum oil, in order to increase its value on the market. Results from the current extraction test batches are expected to be
received by mid-April 2019 and will serve as a basis for the final terms of the sale of the biomass by the Partners. Our joint
venture with Global Hemp Group regarding the Scio Oregon project is a related party transaction insofar as its director, Charles
Larsen, is a beneficial owner of more than 10% of our common stock, and a former director of the Company, and our President and
Chief Executive Officer Donald Steinberg is a shareholder in Global Hemp Group.

Recent Government Decriminalization and Legalization of Hemp
 
On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill”. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, and hemp derived CBD were classified as Schedule 1 controlled substances, and so illegal under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 811 (hereafter referred to as the “CSA”). 
 
With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.
 Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive “high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis—or marijuana—under federal law and would thus face no legal protection under this new legislation and would be an illegal Schedule 1 drug under the CSA. 
 
Additionally, there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally-run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under Occupational Health and Safety Act—both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems.
 
The Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.
 One of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort. Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further, section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also recognizes that there is a still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives.
 We currently operate two divisions within the regulated cannabis industry: (i) the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of our hempSMART™ consumer products that include non-psychoactive industrial hemp-based CBD as an ingredient; and, (ii) professional financial consulting and property management services
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market and sell our services and products throughout the United States in states that have implemented regulated cannabis programs as well as Canada. We intend to expand our offerings as additional countries, states and jurisdictions adopt state-regulated or federal programs. We market and sell our hempSMART™ products directly through our web site, and through our affiliate marketing program, where qualified sales affiliates use a secure multi-level-marketing sales software program that facilitates order placement over the internet via a web site, and accounts for affiliate orders and sales; calculates referral benefits apportionable to specific sales associates and calculates and accounts for loyalty and rewards benefits for returning customers. We also retained a full-service marketing company that uses a multi-channel transactional marketing campaign focused on digital advertising, infographics, content marketing, customer incentives and acquisition, a broad social media presence, as well as search engine marketing and optimization that includes comprehensive research and analytics and order fulfillment in order to boost direct sales.
 
On March 21, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary, hempSMART, Ltd., a corporation organized in the United Kingdom, officially launched the sales efforts for the Company’s industrial hemp CBD formulated hempSMART™ products in the United Kingdom. We retained Mr. Ian Harvey as our Global Sales Director. Our sales efforts in the UK and EU will be accomplished through our affiliate marketing program.
 
Research and Development 
  
11
--

 

Our research and development activity for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily focused on formulations of our various hempSMART™ products. Our research and development costs were $1,500. We expect to conduct additional research and development as the Company expands its hempSMART™ line of products.
 
Significant Customers
 
Sales of our hempSMART™ products, both directly by us and through our affiliate marketing sales program, have yet to produce material revenues, and so our operations have not resulted in reportable significant customers. Company has recently launched a wholesale marketing model, which went fully operational, may result in a concentration of sales coming from one customer.
Intellectual Property
 
On February 12, 2019, the U. S. Patent Office issued patent number 10,201,553 for the Company’s hempSMART™ Brain product. On October 3, 2016, H Smart, Inc. filed a trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the tradename hempSMART™, Application No. 87/531,833. The trademark has not yet been registered, and the application is pending.
Competition
 
Our competitors include professional services firms dedicated to the regulated hemp industry, as well as sellers of hemp-based CBD products. We compete in markets where cannabis and/or hemp has been legalized and regulated, which includes various states within the United States and Canada. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new states and geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate cannabis and hemp products, such as and including the 2018 Farm Bill. We believe that by being well established in the industry, our experience, and our continued expansion of service and product offerings in new and existing locations, are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our expected operations and results.
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 16 full-time employees and independent contractors, most of whom are U.S. based, primarily in California at our Escondido headquarters. None of our U.S employees are represented by a labor union.
