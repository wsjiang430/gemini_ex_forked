Item 1.       BUSINESS Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics using our proprietary AMPPLIFY™ mucus-penetrating particle, or MPP, drug delivery technology, with an initial focus on the treatment of eye diseases. The innovative MPP technology, which we refer to as our AMPPLIFY technology, uses selectively‑sized nanoparticles that each have a proprietary coating. We believe that these two key attributes enable even distribution of drug particles on mucosal surfaces and significantly increase drug delivery to target tissues by enhancing mobility of drug particles through mucus and preventing drug particles from becoming trapped and eliminated by mucus. We have applied the AMPPLIFY technology to loteprednol etabonate, or LE, a corticosteroid designed for ocular applications, resulting in the August 2018 approval of INVELTYS™ (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) 1%, our topical twice-a-day ocular steroid for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and the development of our lead product candidate, KPI‑121 0.25%, for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. We commercially launched INVELTYS in January 2019.
 KPI‑121 0.25% is our product candidate for patients with dry eye disease utilizing a two‑week course of therapy. In January 2018, we announced topline results from two completed Phase 3 clinical trials, which we refer to as STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2 (STRIDE - S hort T erm R elief I n  D ry E ye), evaluating the safety and efficacy of KPI-121 0.25% versus vehicle (placebo) in patients with dry eye disease. In STRIDE 1, statistical significance was achieved for the primary sign endpoint of conjunctival hyperemia and the primary symptom endpoint of ocular discomfort severity change from baseline to day 15 in the intent to treat, or ITT, population; in addition,  statistical significance was also achieved in STRIDE 1 for a second pre-specified primary symptom endpoint of ocular discomfort severity change from baseline to day 15 in patients with more severe baseline ocular discomfort. In STRIDE 2, statistical significance was achieved for the primary sign endpoint of conjunctival hyperemia, but statistical significance was not achieved for the primary symptom endpoint of ocular discomfort severity. KPI‑121 0.25% was generally well tolerated in both STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2, with no clinically significant treatment‑related adverse events observed during the course of either trial, and with elevations in interocular pressure, or IOP in both trials similar to placebo.
 In December 2018, the FDA accepted for filing our new drug application, or NDA, for KPI‑121 0.25%.  The FDA has set a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, of August 15, 2019.  Based upon the recommendation of the FDA, we also initiated an additional Phase 3 clinical trial, STRIDE 3, in the third quarter of 2018 evaluating KPI‑121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. We believe we have identified key factors that contributed to the differences observed in the results from STRIDE 2 compared to those of STRIDE 1 and the Phase 2 trial, and that changes made to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of STRIDE 3 based on these analyses will improve the probability of success. If approved, KPI-121 0.25% could be the first FDA-approved product for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
 INVELTYS is the first and only FDA‑approved ocular corticosteroid product with a twice-a-day dosing regimen for the treatment of post‑operative inflammation and pain. Other approved topical ocular corticosteroid products for this indication are dosed four times a day. In clinical trials, INVELTYS showed statistical significance in the primary efficacy endpoints of complete resolution of inflammation at day eight maintained through day 15 with no need for rescue medication compared to placebo and complete resolution of pain at day eight maintained through day 15 with no need for rescue medications compared to placebo.
 We are evaluating opportunities for MPP nanosuspensions of LE with less frequent daily dosing regimens for the temporary relief of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease and for potential chronic treatment of dry eye disease. We also are evaluating compounds in our receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor program, or rTKI program, that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, pathway, for the potential treatment of a number of retinal diseases.
 INVELTYS received FDA approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, which is the pathway we plan to rely on for the approval of KPI‑121 0.25% as well. We have retained

worldwide commercial rights for INVELTYS and our current product candidates. Since FDA approval of INVELTYS, we have built a commercial infrastructure with our own focused, specialty sales force which includes 57 territory sales managers, or TSMs, 7 regional sales leaders, or RSLs, and 3 directors of national accounts, or DNAs. If KPI-121 0.25% is approved for the temporary treatment of dry eye disease, we expect to further expand our sales force by up to an additional 100 personnel. We expect to commercialize in the United States any of our other product candidates that receive marketing approval as well. In anticipation of the potential to commercialize our product candidates in other global markets, we are evaluating a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties.
 We own and/or exclusively license patents relating to INVELTYS, our product candidates and AMPPLIFY technology, including U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications covering KPI‑121, our rTKI program, other products under development and our AMPPLIFY technology, along with pending patent applications relating to ophthalmic applications of our AMPPLIFY technology. The earliest expiration date of an issued U.S. patent covering INVELTYS and our current product candidates is in 2033. The earliest expiration date of an issued U.S. patent relating to our AMPPLIFY technology is in 2027.
 The following table describes the stage of each of our current programs:

     Our Product
 INVELTYS for Post‑Operative Inflammation and Pain
 Ocular inflammation and pain are common complications following ocular surgery. According to Marketscope, a third‑party provider of market data, in 2018 there were approximately 8.2 million ocular surgeries in the United States. Tissue damage caused by ocular surgery leads to the production of prostaglandins, lipids that aid in recovery at the site of an injury, and an increase in blood flow to the affected area, which contribute to inflammation. The standard of care for post‑operative inflammation and pain includes anti‑inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids, which improve patient comfort and accelerate recovery through disruption of the inflammatory cascade.

 INVELTYS received FDA approval in August 2018 for the treatment of post-surgical inflammation and pain following all ocular surgery, and was commercially launched in the United States in January 2019. INVELTYS is the first and only post-operative ocular steroid shown effective and FDA approved for twice-a-day, or BID, dosing, has the highest concentration (1%) of LE on the market in the United States and is formulated with our AMPPLIFY technology, which enables INVELTYS to deliver 3.75x more drug to the ocular tissue compared to an active comparator. Based on a market survey we commissioned of 100 ophthalmologists, we believe INVELTYS offers advantages over other existing post‑surgical treatment options due to its twice‑daily dosing, two‑week course of treatment and safety data, including low incidence of reported IOP spikes, and efficacy data from our clinical trials.
 In each of the two Phase 3 clinical trials of INVELTYS in patients who had undergone cataract surgery, administration of INVELTYS two times a day for 14 days achieved statistical significance for both primary efficacy endpoints of complete resolution of inflammation at day eight maintained through day 15 with no need for rescue medication and complete resolution of pain at day eight maintained through day 15 with no need for rescue medication. In each of these trials, INVELTYS was well tolerated with similar increases in IOP, a common side effect of steroids, compared to placebo and with no treatment‑related significant adverse events observed during the course of either trial.

 KPI‑121 0.25% for Dry Eye Disease
 Dry eye disease is a chronic, episodic, multifactorial disease affecting the tears and ocular surface that can result in tear film instability, inflammation, discomfort, visual disturbance and ocular surface damage. Dry eye disease can have a significant impact on quality of life and can potentially cause long‑term damage to the ocular surface. Due to the impact of dry eye disease on tear film dynamics, the condition can affect performance of common vision‑related activities such as reading, using a computer and driving, and can lead to complications associated with visual impairment. In addition, the vast majority of dry eye patients experience acute exacerbations of their symptoms, which are commonly referred to as flares, at various times throughout the year. These flares can be triggered by numerous factors, including exposure to allergens, pollution, wind and low humidity, intense visual concentration such as watching television and working at a computer, hormonal changes, contact lens wear, smoking and sleep deprivation, which cause ocular surface inflammation and impact tear production and/or tear film stability.
 We estimate dry eye disease affects approximately 33 million people in the United States based on an estimated dry eye disease prevalence of 14.5% described below and applied to the population of the United States over 20 years old. Based on third‑party academic research, we believe dry eye disease results in approximately $55 billion in direct and indirect costs in the United States each year, of which approximately $3.8 billion are direct medical costs. The exact prevalence of dry eye disease is unknown due to the difficulty in defining the disease and the lack of a single diagnostic test to confirm its presence. The Beaver Dam Offspring Study, a major epidemiological study published in 2014 in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, reported that in a cohort of over 3,000 patients, dry eye disease was self‑reported by 14.5% of the patients. The prevalence of dry eye disease increases with age, and we expect that the number of dry eye disease cases will increase as the U.S. population continues to age. Epidemiology and market research commissioned by us indicate that there are an estimated 16 million patients with a diagnosis of dry eye disease in the United States. We commissioned two surveys of 503 and 297 dry eye disease patients, which we refer to as the patient surveys. The patient surveys included a representative set of dry eye patients based on demographics and disease characteristics, such as age, sex and therapeutic history. The patients represented a broad range of dry eye disease severity. Based upon our review of the patient survey, we believe dry eye disease is a burdensome disease that has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients with dry eye disease.
 The most commonly used treatments for dry eye disease in the United States are over‑the‑counter eye drops, often referred to as “artificial tears,” and two prescription pharmaceutical products, Restasis® and Xiidra®. Artificial tears are intended to be palliative in nature to supplement insufficient tear production or improve tear film instability, but do not treat the underlying inflammation in dry eye disease. Restasis increases tear production and Xiidra treats the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, however, both Restasis and Xiidra are typically used chronically for dry eye patients who have continuous symptoms. Restasis had sales in 2018 of approximately $1.2 billion in the United States. Xiidra, which was commercially launched in the United States in August 2016, had sales of approximately $255.1 million for

the nine month period ended September 30, 2018. As each of Restasis and Xiidra have a relatively long onset of action, they are not generally used for the short‑term treatment of episodic dry eye flares. We believe there is a larger proportion of dry eye patients whose symptoms are primarily episodic as opposed to chronic, and for whom a chronic therapy is not necessary. For these patients, we believe an FDA‑approved, acute, short‑term therapy can address a significant unmet need. Our review of the patient surveys indicates that approximately 90% of surveyed patients reported experiencing short-term flares, with flares lasting on average approximately 4 days and occurring approximately 6 times per year. The patients surveyed also indicated that the most common reason for discontinuing the two leading branded dry eye treatments were insufficient efficacy and side effects. In addition, the results of a multi-sponsored Gallup Poll survey were consistent with our patient surveys, indicating on average 5-6 flares per year lasting on average 4 days.
 We are developing KPI‑121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, utilizing a two‑week course of therapy administered four times a day. We believe that KPI‑121 0.25%’s broad mechanism of action, rapid onset of relief of both signs and symptoms, favorable tolerability profile and potential to be complementary to existing therapies, will result in a favorable profile for the management of dry eye flares and other dry eye associated conditions that would benefit from temporary relief of dry eye signs and symptoms. We believe these features of KPI‑121 0.25% may be attractive to prescribing clinicians and could be a first line prescription medication choice for a substantial number of their dry eye patients. Based upon our review of the patient surveys, we also believe patients with dry eye disease will be attracted to KPI‑121 0.25%’s novelty, rapid efficacy in the relief of signs and symptoms and ability to be used on an as‑needed basis to treat the short-term flares.
 In June 2016, we initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials, STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2 each with enrollment of over 900 dry eye patients, comparing KPI‑121 0.25% to placebo, both administered four times a day for 14 days. We announced topline results from both trials in January 2018. Statistical significance was achieved for the primary sign and both pre-specified primary symptom endpoints in STRIDE 1. Statistical significance was achieved for the primary sign endpoint in STRIDE 2 with a trend towards a treatment effect for the primary symptom endpoint. KPI‑121 0.25% was generally well tolerated in both STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2, with no clinically significant treatment‑related adverse events observed during the course of either the trial. In December 2018, the FDA accepted for filing our NDA for KPI‑121 0.25%, and the FDA has set a target action date under PDUFA of August 15, 2019. The NDA includes data from three clinical trials studying approximately 2,000 patients, including one Phase 2 trial and two Phase 3 efficacy and safety trials (STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2). Based upon the recommendation of the FDA, we also initiated an additional Phase 3 clinical trial, STRIDE 3, in the third quarter of 2018 evaluating KPI‑121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. We believe we have identified key factors that contributed to the differences observed in the results from STRIDE 2 compared to those of STRIDE 1 and the Phase 2 trial, and that changes made to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of STRIDE 3 based on these analyses will improve the probability of success. We expect to report top-line results for STRIDE 3 in the fourth quarter of 2019. If approved, KPI-121 0.25% could be the first FDA-approved product for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
 rTKI Program for Retinal Diseases
 Commonly used therapies for retinal diseases must be injected directly into the patient’s eye, often at monthly intervals. We believe that our AMPPLIFY technology has the potential to facilitate the delivery of therapeutics into tissues in the back of the eye, which has the potential to improve dosing regimen and offers a competitive advantage over current therapies.
 After synthesizing and testing a number of new chemical entities, or NCEs, from our rTKI program, we are further evaluating compounds in our rTKI program that inhibit the VEGF pathway for the potential treatment of a number of retinal diseases, including wet age‑related macular degeneration, or Wet AMD, Diabetic Retinopathy, or DR, Diabetic Macular Edema, or DME, and Retinal Vein Occlusion, or RVO, each of which involves either the leakage of existing blood vessels or the proliferation of poorly formed and leaky blood vessels at the back of the eye. These eye diseases can significantly reduce vision and eventually lead to blindness. VEGF is a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels and increased permeability, two pathological processes that contribute to the vision loss associated with certain retinal diseases. In our rTKI program, we are initially targeting Wet AMD with our lead rTKI compound, KPI‑285. KPI‑285 inhibits the VEGF pathway. In preclinical rabbit studies, topical administration of KPI‑285 achieved concentrations in tissues in the back of the eye well above the concentrations required for in vitro
 
  7

 
inhibition of 50% of the VEGF receptor kinase activity. Prior to initiating IND‑enabling studies, we may consider potential collaborative partnership opportunities to advance product candidates we develop through our rTKI program, including KPI‑285.
 Other Potential Applications of our AMPPLIFY Technology
 While our current focus is on the application of our AMPPLIFY technology in ophthalmology, we have conducted preclinical studies demonstrating the potential of our AMPPLIFY technology in other therapeutic areas. Mucus limits delivery of conventionally formulated drugs to the lung, cervical/vaginal tract, gastrointestinal tract and other mucus‑protected tissues. In preclinical studies, we have demonstrated that our AMPPLIFY technology can be used to increase the mucus penetration of over fifteen classes of drugs, including anti‑infective and anti‑inflammatory drugs.
 Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics using our proprietary AMPPLIFY technology. Key elements of our strategy include:
· | Maximize the commercial potential of INVELTYS for post‑operative inflammation and pain. In January 2019, we began to commercialize INVELTYS in the United States with our own focused, specialty sales force of 57 TSMs, 7 RSLs and 3 DNAs, targeting both ophthalmologists and optometrists. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Seek and obtain regulatory approval for, and maximize the commercial potential of, KPI‑121 0.25% for the treatment of dry eye disease. In December 2018, the FDA accepted for filing our NDA for KPI‑121 0.25%, and set a target action date under PDUFA of August 15, 2019. Based upon the recommendation of the FDA, we also initiated an additional Phase 3 clinical trial, STRIDE 3, in the third quarter of 2018 evaluating KPI‑121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. We believe we have identified key factors that contributed to the differences observed in the results from STRIDE 2 compared to those of STRIDE 1 and the Phase 2 trial, and that changes made to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of STRIDE 3 based on these analyses will improve the probability of success. If approved, we intend to commercialize KPI‑121 0.25% in the United States with our specialty sales force, which we expect to expand by approximately 100 representatives that will target ophthalmologists and optometrists. We also expect to explore commercialization of KPI‑121 0.25% for the treatment of dry eye disease in certain markets outside the United States, including the European Union, or EU, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties.

Prior to initiating IND‑enabling studies, we may consider potential collaborative partnership opportunities to advance product candidates we develop through our rTKI program, including KPI‑285. In addition, we also are evaluating additional product opportunities with significant unmet medical needs that we believe can be addressed by our proprietary AMPPLIFY technology, including diseases of the lung.

· | Business development through selective acquisitions and licensing. We plan to pursue value-driven business development opportunities as they arise in order to enhance our business and product pipeline through strategically acquiring clinical or commercial-ready product candidates or approved revenue-generating products with growth potential, particularly in the ophthalmic area. We will also continue to assess the addition of other specialty therapeutic areas through both product/portfolio acquisitions or other M&A activity with a similar focus on opportunities that we anticipate are or will become revenue generating and accretive.

 Our MPP Technology
 Opportunities in Drug Delivery across Mucosal Barriers
 The body is surrounded by boundary tissues that play the important physiological role of preventing foreign bodies from penetrating into the body. The mucus that coats these tissues, the eyes, lung, cervical/vaginal tract and gastrointestinal tract, for example, serves as a protective barrier to trap and eliminate particulate matter, such as viruses, bacteria and allergens, before these agents can enter the underlying tissues and cause infections or elicit reactions. However, in playing this pivotal role of protection, mucus can also hinder medical treatments by limiting the penetration of medications to mucus‑protected tissues, thereby reducing their therapeutic effect.
 Mucus also makes it difficult to treat many ophthalmic diseases. The body can rapidly eliminate drugs delivered to the eye via the tear film protecting the surface of the eye, which can significantly limit the effectiveness of these drugs. This is the case both for drugs designed to treat conditions in the front of the eye, such as dry eye disease and post‑operative inflammation and pain, as well as for drugs designed to treat conditions in the back of the eye, such as retinal diseases. We believe that our proprietary MPP technology, which we refer to as our AMPPLIFY technology, has the potential to address this clear unmet medical need for more efficient delivery of drugs.
 MPP Technology
 Our MPPs are selectively‑sized nanoparticles, with average diameters of approximately 330 nanometers, and have non‑covalent proprietary coatings. We believe that these two key attributes enable even distribution of drug particles on mucosal surfaces and significantly increase drug delivery to target tissues by enhancing mobility of drug particles through mucus and preventing drug particles from becoming trapped and eliminated by mucus. We believe this enables enhanced efficacy at equal or lower doses as well as less frequent dosing for improved patient convenience and compliance.
 In a preclinical study, MPPs or conventional particles in a hypotonic solution were administered intravaginally to mice. Ten minutes after administration, the vaginal tissues were dissected and stained. The image on the left below shows the distribution of the conventional particles and the image on the right below shows the distribution of the MPPs. The conventional particles aggregated in the lumenal mucus and did not reach the target tissues. In contrast, the MPPs coated the entire vaginal epithelium, including all the target surfaces.

 While a significant portion of conventionally formulated ophthalmic drugs are rapidly eliminated via the tear film, we have shown that our MPPs are capable of achieving higher concentration on the surface of the eye, thereby enabling the active drug substance to reach cells in the underlying ocular tissue at higher levels.
 The graphic below illustrates the ability of our MPP drug nanoparticles to penetrate the tear and membrane‑bound mucins to reach the ocular surface, as compared to conventional, non‑coated particles, which adhere to the mucins in the tear film and are cleared with the tears through blinking.

 This graphic is included for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to provide a complete representation of the way in which our MPP drug nanoparticles interact with the ocular surface.
 Our initial focus is to leverage our MPP technology, to enhance delivery of drugs into the eye. In preclinical studies, KPI‑121 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics and increased drug penetration into ocular tissues as compared to a branded form of LE. In a preclinical study of ocular inflammation in rabbits, KPI‑121 0.5% administered four times a day, or QID, showed a larger reduction of inflammation as compared to a branded form of LE 0.5% given QID, as measured by the mean aqueous humor cell counts after intravitreal injection of lipopolysaccharide. We also administered either 0.4% KPI‑121 or 0.5% branded LE to the eyes of two groups of rabbits. As illustrated in the line graph below, the concentrations of LE in aqueous humor, a transparent gelatinous fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers between the lens and the cornea, of the rabbit eyes treated with KPI‑121 were more than three times higher than the rabbit eyes treated with branded LE 30 minutes after dosing, at a 20% lower concentration.

 LE in Aqueous Humor

 We administered KPI‑121 0.5%, branded LE 0.5%, or 0.5% of an LE non‑MPP nanoparticle, to the eyes of three groups of rabbits and measured the amount of LE that was delivered to the cornea. The non‑MPP nanoparticle was similar in size to our MPP nanoparticles but lacked the proprietary surface coating used in our MPP nanoparticles. As illustrated in the line graph below, concentrations of LE in the cornea of the rabbit eyes treated with KPI‑121 were more than three times higher than the concentrations in rabbits treated with branded LE between 20 and 40 minutes after dosing. In addition, the rabbit eyes treated with the non‑MPP nanoparticles had concentrations of LE similar to that in the rabbit eyes treated with branded LE and did not display the improved drug bioavailability properties observed with KPI‑121. We believe these results highlight the importance of our proprietary MPP technology and show that KPI‑121’s improved pharmacokinetic profile has the potential to reduce the dosing strength and/or frequency of administration of LE with KPI‑121 as compared to branded LE.

 
  11

 

 LE in Cornea

 We also have demonstrated the potential of our MPP nanoparticles to increase the mucus penetration of over fifteen classes of drugs. While our current focus is in ophthalmology, in preclinical studies, our MPP technology has been effective in delivering drugs to the lungs, cervical/vaginal tract, gastrointestinal tract and other mucus‑protected tissues. We have the ability to vary the rate of drug release as appropriate for the targeted disease state and tissue. As a result, drugs can be delivered either in rapid release formulations or as sustained release formulations that slowly release drug over a time period that ranges from hours to days.
 Eye Disease
 The human eye is often segmented into two sections—the front and back of the eye. The front of the eye consists of tissues and structures responsible for the protection and maintenance of the eye (including the cornea, conjunctiva and tear film), for providing nutrition to the various tissues of the eye (aqueous humor) and for facilitating the optimal transfer and focusing of light to the retina (including the cornea, iris and lens). Front‑of‑the‑eye diseases include ocular inflammation, dry eye disease, infection, allergy and refractive disorders. Clinicians typically treat diseases that affect the front of the eye with topically applied eye drops. A major limitation of these treatments is that the eye rapidly eliminates topically applied medications via the tear film, limiting the penetration of drugs into the ocular tissue.
 The back of the eye contains the retina, which is the light sensing layer of tissue, the choroid, which is a key vascular layer of the eye, the vitreous humor, which is a transparent gel that fills the vitreous chamber between the lens and the retina, and the optic nerve, which transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. Common retinal diseases include AMD, DR, DME and RVO. These diseases frequently result in damage to the vasculature of the eye, leading to poor function and/or leaking of existing vessels and often leading to proliferation of new, abnormal and leaky blood vessels in the back of the eye. These conditions can lead to retinal damage, scarring and irreversible loss of vision. The most common treatments for these diseases involve administration of biologic agents that block the VEGF pathway and prevent or retard the blood vessel leakage and/or proliferation. Unfortunately, clinicians must inject these biologic agents directly into the vitreous of the eye via frequent intravitreal injections, or IVTs, to maintain vision. An effective therapeutic to treat retinal diseases with improved dosing regimen would bring significant benefits to patients.

 Our Product and Product Candidates
 KPI‑121 Program
 Both INVELTYS and our lead product candidate, KPI‑121 0.25%, consist of MPP nanosuspensions of LE designed to enhance penetration through the mucus layer of the tear film to enable LE to reach the underlying ocular tissue. We believe that INVELTYS and KPI‑121 0.25%, have a favorable profile for the treatment of front‑of‑the‑eye inflammatory conditions due to their broad mechanism of action, rapid onset of relief and favorable tolerability profile. LE is a corticosteroid developed specifically for the treatment of ophthalmic conditions and is designed to limit side effects, such as increases in IOP and cataract formation, that are associated with other ocular steroids. The first LE containing product was approved by the FDA in 1998.
 INVELTYS and KPI‑121 0.25% are eye drops that are topically administered as an aqueous suspension of LE. In preclinical studies, MPP nanosuspensions of LE demonstrated superior pharmacokinetic characteristics and bioavailability as compared to branded LE, with increased penetration of LE into ocular tissues. Our KPI-121 program includes the following:

· | FDA-approved INVELTYS, administered two times a day, for the treatment of post‑operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | KPI‑121 0.25%, administered four times a day, which we are developing for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  INVELTYS received FDA approval in August 2018 under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. The Section 505(b)(2) pathway provides an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations, or new uses of previously approved products, by enabling an applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of the NDA. An NDA filed under Section 505(b)(2) allows us to reference the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for LE to supplement the safety and efficacy data generated in our clinical trials. In December 2018, the FDA accepted our NDA for KPI-121 0.25% for filing and granted a PDUFA date of August 15, 2019. We are seeking FDA approval of KPI‑121 0.25% through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as well.
 KPI‑121 0.25% for Dry Eye Disease
 Dry Eye Disease Overview
 Dry eye disease is a chronic, episodic, multifactorial disease affecting the tears and ocular surface that can result in tear film instability, inflammation, discomfort, visual disturbance and ocular surface damage. While the precise cause of dry eye disease is not fully understood, it often involves impairment of the lacrimal unit, which consists of the lacrimal glands, ocular surface and the sensory and motor nerves that connect them, and has a significant inflammatory component. There is significant published research that suggests that inflammation plays a major role in the development of dry eye disease. Dry eye disease can have a significant impact on quality of life and can potentially cause long‑term damage to the ocular surface. Due to the impact of dry eye disease on tear film dynamics, the condition can affect performance of common vision‑related activities such as reading, using a computer and driving, and can lead to complications associated with visual impairment. Dry eye disease is commonly treated by ophthalmologists and optometrists.

 A significant number of dry eye disease patients experience acute, episodic exacerbations of their symptoms, which we refer to as flares, at various times throughout the year that can cause significant discomfort and disability. A dry eye flare is defined as a rapid onset, inflammation-driven response to a variety of triggers that typically cannot be adequately managed with the patient’s ongoing therapy. As illustrated in the graphic below, these flares can be triggered by numerous factors, such as environmental stimuli related to exposure to allergens, pollution, wind and low humidity. Intense visual concentration, such as watching television or working at a computer, can also trigger flares. Other potential triggers include contact lens wear, smoking and sleep deprivation, which cause ocular surface inflammation and impact tear production and/or tear film stability.

 We estimate dry eye disease affects approximately 33 million people in the United States. Based on third‑party academic research, we believe dry eye disease results in approximately $55 billion in direct and indirect costs in the United States each year, of which approximately $3.8 billion are direct medical costs. The exact prevalence of dry eye disease is unknown due to the difficulty in defining the disease and the lack of a single diagnostic test to confirm its presence. The Beaver Dam Offspring Study, a major epidemiological study published in 2014 in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, reported that in a cohort of over 3,000 patients, dry eye disease was self‑reported by 14.5% of the patients. The prevalence of dry eye disease increases with age, and we expect that the number of dry eye disease cases will increase as the U.S. population continues to age. Epidemiology and market research commissioned by us indicate that there are an estimated 16 million patients with a diagnosis of dry eye disease in the United States. The vast majority of dry eye patients experience acute exacerbations of their symptoms, which are commonly referred to as flares, at various times throughout the year.
 The most commonly used treatments for dry eye disease in the United States are over‑the‑counter eye drops, often referred to as “artificial tears,” and two prescription pharmaceutical products, Restasis and Xiidra. Artificial tears are palliative in nature and intended to supplement insufficient tear production or improve tear film instability, but do not treat the underlying inflammation in dry eye disease. Restasis increases tear production and Xiidra treats the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, however, both Restasis and Xiidra are typically used chronically for dry eye patients who have continuous symptoms. As each of Restasis and Xiidra have a relatively long onset of action, they are not generally

used for the short‑term treatment of episodic dry eye flares. We believe there is a larger proportion of dry eye patients whose symptoms are primarily episodic as opposed to chronic, and for whom a chronic therapy is not necessary and an FDA‑approved, acute, short‑term therapy can address a significant unmet need
 Limitations of Existing Treatments for Dry Eye Disease
 Initial treatment for dry eye disease in the United States frequently consists of over‑the‑counter artificial tear/lubricating eye drops. Most over‑the‑counter artificial tears are palliative and typically provide only short term or temporary relief by lubricating the eyes and helping to maintain moisture on the outer surface of the eye. These products do not treat the underlying inflammatory components of dry eye disease.
 In addition to over‑the‑counter artificial tears, Restasis and Xiidra are sometimes prescribed as a chronic therapy for the treatment of dry eye disease. We believe that less than 15% of patients diagnosed with dry eye disease in the United States use a chronic therapy to treat their disease. Restasis is a topically applied, ophthalmic formulation of the immuno‑suppressant cyclosporine. Restasis is not approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, but rather for increasing tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with dry eye disease. In 2018, Restasis had sales of approximately $1.2 billion in the United States. Restasis frequently causes burning upon instillation, and, according to the package insert, 17% of patients in clinical trials of Restasis reported ocular burning upon instillation. Xiidra is a topically applied ophthalmic formulation of lifitegrast, a small molecule LF1a antagonist, which was approved by the FDA in July 2016 for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease and was commercially launched in the United States in August 2016. Xiidra had sales of approximately $255.1 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018. Xiidra, like Restasis, is typically used chronically. Due to each of Restasis and Xiidra having a relatively long onset of action, they are not generally used for the short‑term treatment of dry eye flares.
 Topically applied steroids have been shown to provide some clinical benefit to patients with dry eye disease. However, no topical steroid products, including INVELTYS, are approved in the United States for the acute or chronic treatment of dry eye disease, and there is no widely established treatment paradigm for the safe use of steroids in treating dry eye disease. As a result, treatment of dry eye disease represents a very small percentage of total ophthalmic steroid use in the United States.
 KPI‑121 0.25% Opportunity in Dry Eye Disease
 We believe that KPI‑121 0.25% has a favorable profile for the management of dry eye disease flares, including the following attributes:

· | Broad mechanism of action. LE is a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are known for their broad anti‑inflammatory properties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rapid onset of relief. In our Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, patients treated with KPI‑121 0.25% reported reductions in ocular discomfort within days of initiation of treatment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Favorable safety and tolerability profile. LE is one of the safest topical ocular steroids available due to its unique pharmacokinetics. LE was designed to be metabolized after exerting its anti‑inflammatory action in the eye. The metabolism of LE to inactive metabolites reduces exposure of the trabecular meshwork, an area of tissue located in the anterior chamber that is responsible for draining the aqueous humor from the eye, to active steroid, thus reducing the risk of an increase in IOP relative to other steroids. In both STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2, KPI‑121 0.25% had comparable rates of IOP to placebo. No serious adverse events were associated with KPI‑121 0.25% in either trial.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Specifically targeting relief of episodic dry eye flares. The mechanism of action and rapid onset of relief of KPI‑121 0.25% in dry eye disease is distinct from that of artificial tears and chronic therapies like Restasis and Xiidra. Therefore, we expect it to be used as a stand‑alone short course therapy to provide rapid relief

of dry eye flares by improving ocular discomfort (a dry eye symptom) and reducing ocular redness (a dry eye sign).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Potentially complementary to existing therapies. We believe that patients on chronic therapies also experience dry eye flares and could potentially benefit from using KPI‑121 0.25% in addition to their maintenance therapy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If we receive FDA approval of an NDA for KPI‑121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, we believe that we could have the first FDA‑approved product for this indication with demonstrated safety and efficacy and a two‑week course dosing regimen. We believe that these attributes will make KPI‑121 0.25% attractive to prescribing clinicians for treating patients that suffer from dry eye flares.
 KPI‑121 0.25% Clinical Development Program
 In 2014, we conducted a Phase 2 double‑masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial of KPI‑121 0.25% in 150 patients with dry eye disease at nine clinical sites. Patients were enrolled in the trial based on their magnitude of conjunctival hyperemia and ocular discomfort prior to treatment. Patients had a two week run‑in with placebo administered four times a day and were required to maintain a similar magnitude of conjunctival hyperemia and ocular discomfort following this run‑in period to be included in the randomization portion of the trial. Upon achieving the trial entry criteria after this run‑in period, patients were randomized to receive either KPI‑121 0.25% or a placebo four times a day for 28 days. Safety and efficacy assessments were made over the four week dosing period.
 For our Phase 2 clinical trial, the primary sign endpoint was conjunctival hyperemia at day 29, as measured via a 0 to 4 scale ranging from no hyperemia (score=0) to severe hyperemia (score=4), and the primary symptom endpoint was ocular discomfort severity at day 29, as reported by the patient on a visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 100 mm (0 mm=very mild; 100 mm=very severe).
 KPI‑121 0.25% achieved statistical significance for the primary clinical sign endpoint of conjunctival hyperemia at day 29. A positive treatment effect for hyperemia was also achieved for conjunctival hyperemia at day 15 (p=0.0090). In addition, a higher proportion of patients treated with KPI‑121 0.25% demonstrated a reduction of one unit or greater in conjunctival hyperemia as compared to patients treated with placebo. Patients treated with KPI‑121 0.25% also showed reductions in the symptom endpoint of ocular discomfort severity at days 29 and 15 but did not reach statistical significance for this endpoint based on the analysis that was pre-defined in the statistical analysis plan.
 Following completion of our Phase 3 trials, we conducted additional analysis on a post-hoc basis of our Phase 2 data using the same statistical analysis plan as used to test the primary symptom endpoints in the Phase 3 trials. Using this analysis we observe a treatment effect for ocular discomfort at day 15 of a similar magnitude as was observed in STRIDE 1 (-5.27 mm difference in Phase 2 compared to -5.44 mm in STRIDE 1) and a p-value of 0.0489. Although post-hoc analyses may be given less weight by regulatory authorities than pre-specified analyses, we believe these analyses may provide important information regarding KPI-121 0.25% and may be helpful in reviewing our NDA submission.
 KPI‑121 0.25% was generally well tolerated, with no treatment‑related significant adverse events observed during the course of the trial. The only treatment‑emergent adverse event reported in greater than 3% of patients was instillation site pain, which was reported in 6.9% of patients treated with KPI‑121 0.25% compared to 3.8% of patients treated with placebo. Patients in the KPI‑121 0.25% and placebo treatment arms had a similar profile with respect to mean IOP, and the number of patients with an IOP increase of greater than 5 mm Hg was similar in the two treatment groups. In June 2016, we initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials, STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2, comparing KPI‑121 0.25% to placebo, both administered four times a day for 14 days. These clinical trials were each multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled, parallel-arm studies comparing KPI-121 0.25% to placebo each dosed QID for 14 days. Patients who met initial screening and inclusion/exclusion criteria underwent a two week run-in period with placebo dosed in each eye QID for 14 days. Patients who continued to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria after the run-in were randomized to either KPI-121 0.25% or placebo. A total of 918 patients were randomized in STRIDE 1 and 909 patients were randomized in STRIDE 2. Conjunctival hyperemia was measured using  a 0 to 4 scale ranging from no hyperemia 

 
  16

 
(score=0) to severe hyperemia (score=4).  Ocular discomfort severity was graded daily by the patient over the entire course of the trial using a visual analog grading scale  ranging from 0 to 100 mm (0 mm=very mild; 100 mm=very severe)  recorded in a patient diary.
 In STRIDE 1, statistical significance was achieved for the primary sign endpoint of conjunctival hyperemia change from baseline to day 15 in the ITT population (p<0.0001) and the primary symptom endpoint of ocular discomfort severity change from baseline to day 15 in the ITT population (p<0.0001). Statistical significance was also achieved for a second pre-specified primary symptom endpoint of ocular discomfort severity change from baseline to day 15 in patients with more severe baseline ocular discomfort (p=0.0008). Statistical significance was not achieved for a second pre-specified primary sign endpoint, inferior corneal staining change from baseline to day 15 (p=0.1128). A positive treatment effect for ocular discomfort was also observed in the ITT population at day eight (p=0.0011), a key secondary endpoint.
 In STRIDE 2, statistical significance was achieved for the primary sign endpoint of conjunctival hyperemia change from baseline to day 15 in the ITT population (p<0.0001). Statistical significance was not achieved for the primary symptom endpoint of ocular discomfort severity change from baseline to day 15 in the ITT population (p=0.1298), although a positive treatment effect was observed at day eight (p=0.0408), a key secondary endpoint. A trend towards a positive treatment effect was observed for ocular discomfort severity change from baseline to day 15 in the patients with more severe baseline ocular discomfort (p=0.0799), which was a key secondary endpoint in this trial.
 The results for ocular hyperemia, ocular discomfort in the ITT population and ocular discomfort in patients with more severe baseline discomfort are shown below.

     We have conducted additional analyses on a post-hoc basis of STRIDE 1, STRIDE 2 and our Phase 2 data to better understand our clinical results, inform our developmental plans and potentially support an NDA submission. One key analysis was evaluation of the Phase 2 ocular discomfort data using the same statistical analysis plan as used to test the primary symptom endpoints in the Phase 3 trials. Using this analysis we observe a treatment effect for ocular discomfort at day 15 of similar magnitude as was observed in STRIDE 1 (-5.27 mm difference in Phase 2 compared to -5.44 mm in STRIDE 1) and a p-value of 0.0489. In addition, we performed an analysis of the pooled data from the ITT populations from STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2, which resulted in an observed positive treatment effect for ocular discomfort at day 15 (p< 0.0001). The pooled results in 2 exploratory analyses in subgroups defined by geographical regions of east and west achieved p-values of 0.0071 and 0.0021 respectively and north and south achieved p-values of 0.0002 and 0.0176, respectively. Further, when we analyzed the ocular discomfort data at days 9 through 14 in STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2 using the same statistical method as day 8 and 15, we observed a positive treatment effect with p-values less than 0.002 at all time points between days 8 and 15 in STRIDE 1 and p-values less than 0.05 at 6 of 8 time points in STRIDE 2. Although post-hoc analyses may be given less weight by regulatory authorities than pre-specified analyses, we believe these analyses may provide important information regarding KPI-121 0.25% and may be helpful in reviewing our NDA submission. 
 KPI-121 0.25% was well tolerated in both trials. The most common adverse event observed in STRIDE 1 was instillation site pain, which was observed in 6.1% of patients in both the KPI-121 0.25% treatment group and the placebo group. The only other adverse event reported by greater than 1% of patients in STRIDE 1 was eye irritation, which was reported in 1.1% of patients on KPI-121 0.25% vs. 1.5% of patients on placebo. Elevations in IOP, a known side effect with topical corticosteroid administration, were similar between the two groups in STRIDE 1 with 0.4% in the KPI-121 0.25% group experiencing an increase in IOP of 5 mm of mercury (mmHg) or greater resulting in an IOP of 21 mmHg or greater compared to 0.4% in the placebo group.
 The most common adverse event observed in STRIDE 2 was instillation pain which was reported by 5.7% of patients in the KPI-121 0.25% treatment group vs. 4.4% in the placebo group. The only other adverse event reported by greater than 1% of patients was blurred vision, which was reported in 0.2% of patients on KPI-121 0.25% vs. 1.3% of patients on placebo. Elevations in IOP were similar between the two groups with 1.1% in the KPI-121 group experiencing an increase in IOP of 5 mmHg or greater resulting in an IOP of 21 mmHg or greater compared to none in the placebo group.
 We met with the FDA in June 2018 to discuss the results our Phase 3 dry eye clinical trials and potential next steps for our dry eye disease program. Based on our discussions, we filed an NDA in September 2018, which included data from three clinical trials studying approximately 2,000 patients, including one Phase 2 trial and two Phase 3 efficacy and safety trials (STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2). In December 2018, the FDA accepted for filing our NDA and set a target action date under PDUFA of August 15, 2019.

 
  18

 

 Based upon our discussions with FDA, we also initiated an additional Phase 3 clinical trial, STRIDE 3, in the third quarter of 2018 evaluating KPI‑121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. The STRIDE 3 trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-arm study comparing KPI-121 0.25% to placebo, each dosed four times a day, or QID, for 14 days, in approximately 900 patients with dry eye disease. Subjects who meet initial screening and inclusion/exclusion criteria undergo a 2-week run-in period with placebo. Subjects who continue to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria after the run-in are randomized to either KPI-121 0.25% or placebo. The primary endpoint, Day 15 ocular discomfort severity, is based upon a patient diary in which ocular discomfort is recorded daily over the entire course of the trial using a visual analog grading scale.
 We believe we have identified key factors that contributed to the differences observed in the results from STRIDE 2 compared to those of STRIDE 1 and the Phase 2 trial, and that changes made to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of STRIDE 3 based on these analyses will improve the probability of success. We expect to report top-line results for STRIDE 3 in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 INVELTYS for Post‑Operative Inflammation and Pain
 Post‑Operative Inflammation and Pain Overview
 Ocular inflammation and pain are common complications following ocular surgery. According to Marketscope, in 2018 there were approximately 8.2 million ocular surgeries in the United States. Marketscope also projected that there would be approximately 10.0 million ocular surgeries in the United States in 2023. Commonly performed ocular surgeries include cataract, cornea, refractive, oculoplastic and glaucoma procedures. Tissue damage caused by ocular surgery leads to the production of prostaglandins and increases in blood flow to the affected area, which contribute to inflammation. The standard of care for post‑operative inflammation and pain includes anti‑inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids, which improve patient comfort and accelerate recovery through disruption of the inflammatory cascade. Commonly used topical ocular corticosteroid products for the treatment of post‑operative inflammation and pain are approved for dosing four times a day. This dosing regimen can be burdensome for patients as they are taking multiple eye drops following surgery, and four‑times‑a‑day dosing is believed to reduce patient compliance.
 INVELTYS was approved by the FDA on August 22, 2018. INVELTYS is the first and only twice-daily ocular corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery.
 Limitations of Treatments for Post‑Operative Inflammation and Pain
 LE is a unique steroid that was designed to limit side effects, such as increases in IOP and cataract formation, that are associated with other ocular steroids. The first LE containing product, Lotemax®, was approved by the FDA in 1998. Subsequent gel and ointment formulations of Lotemax were approved by the FDA for the treatment of post‑operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. Durezol® is a topical steroid approved by the FDA for the treatment of inflammation and pain associated with ocular surgery. Durezol eye drops are dosed four times a day for two weeks followed by dose tapering based on patient response.
 The most commonly used ocular steroids, including Lotemax products and Durezol, are approved for the treatment of post‑operative inflammation and pain with a four‑times‑a‑day dosing regimen. This dosing regimen can be burdensome for patients as they are taking multiple eye drops following surgery, and four‑times‑a‑day dosing may reduce patient compliance with the prescribed medication. Other than INVELTYS, there is currently no marketed ocular steroid product with an approved twice‑a‑day dosing regimen.
 INVELTYS Opportunity in Post‑Operative Inflammation and Pain
 We believe that INVELTYS has a favorable profile for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery, including the following attributes:

· | Twice daily dosing. INVELTYS is the first and only twice-daily ocular corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. All other ocular corticosteroid
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  19

 

products for the treatment of post‑operative inflammation and pain are approved for dosing four times a day. Given the generally accepted view that less frequent dosing leads to higher patient compliance, we believe the ability to achieve a significant reduction in inflammation and pain following surgery with a twice‑a‑day product will be a key differentiating attribute of INVELTYS.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Favorable safety and tolerability profile. LE is one of the safest topical ocular steroids available due to its unique pharmacokinetics. LE was designed to be metabolized after exerting its anti‑inflammatory action in the eye. The metabolism of LE to inactive metabolites reduces exposure of the trabecular meshwork to the active steroid, thus reducing risk of IOP increase relative to other steroids. In our completed Phase 3 clinical trials, INVELTYS had a tolerability profile comparable to placebo, with no treatment‑related serious adverse events observed during the course of either Phase 3 trial.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our current estimates of potential future revenue from sales of INVELTYS are based, in part, on market research data we have commissioned. For example, based on a market survey we commissioned of 100 ophthalmologists, we believe INVELTYS offers advantages over existing post‑surgical treatment options due to its twice‑daily dosing, two‑week course of treatment and safety data, including low incidence of reported IOP spikes, and efficacy data from our clinical trials. In this market survey, a majority of surveyed ophthalmologists indicated they were likely to prescribe INVELTYS.
 Other Preclinical Opportunities for Dry Eye Disease
 Building on the results of our clinical trials for our INVELTYS and KPI‑121 0.25% product candidates, we are evaluating opportunities for MPP nanosuspensions of LE with less frequent daily dosing regimens for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease and for potential chronic treatment of dry eye disease.
 rTKI Program
 Retinal Disease
 There are a range of retinal diseases and conditions that adversely affect vision.
 Age‑Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
 AMD is a degeneration of the macula of the retina that leads to impairment and loss of central vision. There are two categories of AMD: “Dry” AMD, which involves slow deterioration of the retina with submacular drusen, atrophy, loss of macular function and central vision impairment; and “Wet” AMD, which involves growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina and macula, resulting in edema, tissue damage and rapid loss of central vision. If untreated, neovascularization in Wet AMD patients typically results in significant vision loss and the formation of a scar under the macular region of the retina. Most cases begin as Dry AMD, which can progress to Wet AMD. Wet AMD is a leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 55 in the United States and the European Union. The incidence of Wet AMD increases substantially with age, and we expect that the number of cases of Wet AMD will increase with growth of the elderly population in the United States.
 The current standard of care for Wet AMD is intravitreal injection of drugs that target VEGF, one of the key proteins involved in neovascularization.
 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)
 DR is an ocular complication of diabetes involving changes of retinal blood vessels that lead to significant visual impairment. These changes include dysfunction of retinal vasculature (nonproliferative retinopathy), with vascular occlusion and increased permeability, leading to retinal hypoxia and DME. The disease can further progress to proliferative retinopathy with retinal neovascularization, hemorrhage and retinal detachment.

 
  20

 

 Among an estimated 19.8 million adults in the United States aged forty years and older known to have diabetes, the prevalence rate for DME is 3.8%, or approximately 746,000 people. DME is the leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in Americans between 20 and 74 years old.
 Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)
 RVO is a blockage of the small veins that carry blood away from the retina. The disease can cause sudden blurring or vision loss in all or part of one eye. RVO has been estimated to affect 16 million people worldwide. Limitations of Existing Treatments for Retinal Disease
 VEGF is a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels and increased permeability, two pathological processes that contribute to the vision loss associated with certain retinal diseases. Several VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been investigated in AMD patients in clinical trials. These inhibitors have been administered in a variety of ways, including intravitreal injection, oral administration and topical dosing. To date, no VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been approved in the United States for the treatment of ocular diseases. We believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for a safe and effective VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors to treat various retinal diseases, such as AMD, DR, DME, RVO and related neovascular diseases.
 The most common treatments for retinal diseases involve administration of biologic agents that block the VEGF pathway and prevent or retard the blood vessel leakage and/or proliferation. Unfortunately, clinicians must inject these biologic agents directly into the eye via frequent IVTs to maintain vision. Sales of the two leading IVT biologic agents used to treat eye diseases associated with abnormal blood vessel proliferation, Genentech’s Lucentis ® and Regeneron’s Eylea ®, were $1.65 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, in the in the United States in 2016. An effective therapeutic to treat retinal diseases with improved dosing regimen would bring significant benefits to patients.
 rTKI Program for the Potential Treatment of Wet AMD, DR, DME and RVO
 Through our rTKI program we generate small molecule NCEs that are designed to be potent VEGF receptor kinase inhibitors. KPI‑285 is our current rTKI lead compound. In preclinical rabbit studies, KPI‑285 demonstrated a potency of less than one nanomolar against the VEGF receptor‑2 kinase and good selectivity against particular growth factor receptor kinases, cell cycle kinases and other detrimental receptors.
 Also in preclinical rabbit studies, topical administration of KPI‑285 achieved concentrations in tissues in the back of the eye well above the concentrations required for in vitro inhibition of 50% of the VEGF receptor kinase activity. In addition, in a rabbit model of VEGF induced vascular leakage, topically applied KPI‑285 MPP reduced leakage to an extent similar to that achieved with an IVT injection of Genentech’s Avastin ® , a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF. In this model, vascular leakage of fluorescein was induced by IVT injections of VEGF. The extent of fluorescein leakage observed in various treatment groups was scored in a blinded fashion on a scale from 0 to 4, with 0 being no leakage and 4 being heavy leakage. As shown in the photographs below, the 

 
  21

 
magnitude of the effect achieved with topical administration of KPI‑285 5.0% was similar to that observed with IVT injection of Avastin.

 We believe that an effective therapy with an improved dosing regimen for patients with retinal diseases such as AMD, DR, DME and RVO will be a significant advancement in the treatment of these diseases and could increase patient compliance and reduce treatment burden in patients suffering from these sight threatening diseases. Prior to initiating IND‑enabling studies, we may consider potential collaborative partnership opportunities to advance our product candidates we develop through our rTKI program, including KPI‑285.
 Potential Applications in Other Diseases
 Mucus limits delivery of conventionally formulated drugs to mucosal tissues such as the lung, cervical/vaginal and gastrointestinal tract. While our current focus is in ophthalmology, our AMPPLIFY technology has been effective in preclinical studies in enhancing drug delivery to these other tissues. We also have demonstrated in preclinical studies that AMPPLIFY technology can be used to increase mucus penetration of over fifteen classes of drugs. Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 Our competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may 

 
  22

 
also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of INVELTYS, our first product, and KPI‑121 0.25% and other product candidates, if approved, are likely to be the product or product candidate’s efficacy, safety, method of administration, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third‑party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products.
 Competition in Inflammation and Pain Following Ocular Surgery
 Following ocular surgery, topical steroids are commonly prescribed to manage and prevent complications from post‑operative inflammation.
 Topical steroid drops are the main competition to INVELTYS for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. The current branded market leaders in the United States based on revenue are Lotemax products and Durezol. Generic topical steroid formulations consist mainly of products containing prednisolone, fluorometholone or dexamethasone.
 There are also non-topical formulations of ocular steroids that have been recently approved and/or marketed. EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, or EyePoint, has received FDA approval for DexycuTM, an intraocular suspension of dexamethasone for the treatment of post-operative inflammation. Eyepoint has stated that it expects to launch Dexycu in the first half of 2019. Ocular Therapeutix, or Ocular, has received FDA approval for Dextenza®, an intracanicular insert of dexamethasone, for the treatment of ocular pain following ophthalmic surgery. Ocular has indicated that it expects to commercially launch Dextenza in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2019. In addition, there are various formulations of steroids that are produced by compounding pharmacies and that are in drop form or are injected into the eye following ocular surgery.
 There also are other product candidates for treatment of pain and inflammation following ocular surgery in the United States that are in earlier stages of development.
 Competition in Dry Eye Disease
 We are developing KPI‑121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, which may include the management of dry eye disease flares. The current disease management approaches for dry eye disease in the United States includes non-pharmaceutical therapies and pharmaceutical therapies. Non-pharmaceutical therapies include over‑the‑counter artificial tear eye drops, which are palliative and used on an intermittent or chronic basis to provide short‑term symptomatic relief of dryness and irritation; hot compresses for the eye and lid hygiene management; devices, such as punctal plugs that are inserted into the tear ducts to inhibit tear drainage, resulting in more moisture on the surface of the eye; and TrueTear® Intranasal Tear Neurostimulator, a neurostimulator that received marketing approval from the FDA in April 2017 which provides electrical pulses within the nasal cavity to stimulate tear production.
 Pharmaceutical therapies for dry eye disease include off‑label prescription drugs, including topical steroid drops and/or other similar products, which are prescribed on occasion for treatment of dry eye disease; on‑label prescription drugs, including Restasis, Xiidra, and CequaTM, which are the only prescription pharmaceutical products that are approved in the United States for use in patients with dry eye disease. Generic versions of Restasis are expected to become available in the U.S. in 2019. Restasis and Cequa are both topical cyclosporine formulations that are approved for increasing tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular 

 
  23

 
keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Xiidra is a topical anti-inflammatory therapy approved for treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
 There are several product candidates in preclinical and clinical development in the United States for the treatment of dry eye disease. These product candidates are being developed by pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies of various sizes, such as Oyster Point Pharma’s OC‑01 and OC‑02, ReGenTree’s RGN‑259, Aldeyra Therapeutics’ reproxalap ophthalmic solution, Aurinia Pharmaceuticals’ voclosporin ophthalmic solution and Surface Pharmaceutical’s SURF‑100 and SURF‑200.
 Based on publicly available information, we have identified various other product candidates in clinical development for the chronic treatment of dry eye disease in the United States. If any of these product candidates is approved and such product candidate either effectively treats the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease or reduces the frequency of flares in dry eye patients, it could reduce the overall market opportunity for KPI‑121 0.25%.
 Competition in Retinal Disease
 Several therapies have been developed to block the effects of VEGF by binding to and sequestering the protein. These include Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Eylea, and Genentech, Inc.’s Lucentis and Avastin. Avastin is approved as an anti‑cancer agent, but is widely used off‑label in ophthalmic diseases. All of these therapies are administered by intravitreal injections and must be regularly dosed for optimal efficacy.
 In addition to the anti-VEGF therapies, there also are marketed drug delivery systems, or DDS, that are used to treat retinal diseases, notably: Ozurdex®, which releases dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, and is marketed by Allergan, and Iluvien®, which releases fluocinolone acetonide, a corticosteroid, and is marketed by Alimera Sciences.
 There are a number of preclinical research and clinical development programs being conducted by third parties to develop treatments for retinal diseases. We expect that product candidates currently in clinical development, or that could enter clinical development in the near future, may represent significant competition if approved. These product candidates may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies.
 Sales and Marketing
 In January 2019, we began commercializing INVELTYS in the United States with our own focused, specialty sales force of 57 TSMs, 7 RSLs and 3 NADs. We believe, our sales team is one of the most experienced in our specialty with our RSLs having an average of 9.1 years ophthalmic experience and 5.4 years sales leadership experience and our 57 TSMs having an average of 7.7 years ophthalmic experience and 12.7 years pharmaceutical sales experience.
 If KPI-121 0.25% is approved for the temporary treatment of dry eye disease, we expect to further expand our sales force by up to an additional 100 personnel. We expect to explore commercialization of KPI‑121 0.25% and potentially other product candidates in certain markets outside the United States, including the EU, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties.
 Manufacturing
 We utilize our substantial in‑house expertise and know‑how to develop and scale up our manufacturing processes before these processes are transferred to third‑party contract manufacturers, and to understand and establish controls of critical process parameters. We also have personnel with deep product development experience who actively manage the third‑party contract manufacturers producing KPI‑121 and other products that we may develop in the future.
 Our KPI‑121 drug product, including commercial lots of INVELTYS, is currently manufactured at qualified contract manufacturing facilities in compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations. We expect that the same facilities we use to manufacture commercial lots of INVELTYS will be used to manufacture commercial lots of KPI‑121 0.25%. Preparation of the concentrated milled suspension is performed by a third party 

 
  24

 
using a manufacturing process developed by us. The milled suspension is sterilized by gamma radiation at a separate third‑party facility. The sterilized milled suspension is then diluted to the final drug product concentrations and filled into multi‑dose ophthalmic dropper bottles at a third‑party manufacturer. Our third‑party manufacturers are subject to FDA inspections from time to time.
 We have supply agreements in place with these contract manufacturers to support KPI‑121 commercial, clinical and registration manufacturing, release testing, registration stability, and labeling and packaging. We also have entered into long term commercial supply agreements with these contract manufacturers to supply KPI‑121.
 Catalent Commercial Supply Agreement. In June 2016, we entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement, or the Catalent Agreement, which we amended in February 2018, with Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC, or Catalent, pursuant to which Catalent has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Catalent, a minimum amount of INVELTYS and KPI‑121 0.25% for commercial use. The Catalent Agreement has an initial term of eight years from August 22, 2018, which is the date INVELTYS was approved for commercial sale in the United States, and which is subject to three‑year automatic renewal periods, absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the commercial supply agreement. The Catalent Agreement provides for pricing for INVELTYS and KPI‑121 0.25% structured on a tiered basis, with the price reduced as the volume of each product ordered increases. We also have annual minimum purchase requirements for each of INVELTYS and KPI‑121 0.25%. We may also pay certain fees in connection with validation and stability test services and commercialization ramp‑up following regulatory approval. We may cancel any purchase order under the Catalent Agreement, subject to our minimum purchase obligations. Each party has the right to terminate the Catalent Agreement for customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The Catalent Agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Catalent with cGMP, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
 Alliance Commercial Supply Agreement. In October 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement, or the Alliance Agreement, with Alliance Contract Pharma, LLC, or Alliance, pursuant to which Alliance has agree to provide to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Alliance, bulk KPI‑121 concentrates. The Alliance Agreement provides for pricing for KPI‑121 concentrates structured on a tiered basis, with the price reduced as the volume of product ordered increases. Under the Alliance Agreement, we will provide a forecast of orders for the quantities of bulk KPI‑121 concentrates we believe we will require, and forecasted quantities will become binding at a certain point before the firm delivery date set forth in the forecast. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms, the Alliance Agreement has an initial term of ten years, after which it continues until terminated. Each party has the right to terminate the Alliance Agreement for customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. In addition, we have the right to terminate the Alliance Agreement at any time for any or no reason upon sufficient advance notice, in which case we would owe payment to Alliance for any firm orders and certain raw materials. The Alliance Agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Alliance with cGMP, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
 Chemo Iberica Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. In January 2017, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, or the Chemo Agreement, with Chemo Iberica SA, or Chemo, pursuant to which Chemo has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Chemo, bulk supply of loteprednol, with pricing structured on a per‑kilogram basis. Under the Chemo Agreement, we will provide a forecast of orders for the quantities of loteprednol we believe we will require, and we commit to purchasing 75% of the forecasted quantities. We can alter portions of a forecast at any time, except that, without Chemo’s consent, we cannot alter a portion of the forecast less than ninety days before the period to which such portion pertains. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms, the Chemo Agreement has an initial term of seven years, after which it renews in two year increments unless either party gives notice of non‑renewal at least one year in advance. Each party has the right to terminate the Chemo Agreement for customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The Chemo Agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Chemo with cGMP, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.

 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, product candidates, technology and know‑how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know‑how, continuing technological innovation and in‑licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 As of February 28, 2019, we owned 21 U.S. issued patents and 17 U.S. patent applications, as well as 23 foreign issued patents and 92 foreign patent applications (including Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications). We exclusively licensed a total of 19 U.S. issued patents and 20 U.S. patent applications, as well as 27 foreign issued patents and 78 foreign patent applications including original filings, continuations and divisional applications. Our patent portfolio includes the following patents and patent applications that we own or exclusively license:

· | six U.S. patents and six U.S. patent application, relating to our MPP technology, which we refer to as our AMPPLIFY technology and INVELTYS and KPI‑121 0.25%, in‑licensed from The Johns Hopkins University, or JHU, two related foreign patents jointly owned by us and JHU, six related foreign patent applications jointly owned by us and JHU, five related foreign patents owned by us and 23 related foreign patent applications owned by us, which, if granted with respect to the patent applications, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, are expected to expire in 2033;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | one U.S. patent application relating to our AMPPLIFY technology, and two related foreign patents and six related foreign patent applications, which are owned by us, and which, if granted with respect to the patent applications, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, are expected to expire in 2033;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 19 U.S. patents and 13 U.S. patent applications, relating to rTKI compounds, including KPI‑285, and their uses, and 11 related foreign patents, and 46 foreign related patent applications, including pending PCT applications, which are owned by us, and which, if granted with respect to the patent applications, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, which are expected to expire beginning in 2034 through 2038;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | One U.S. patent and one U.S. patent application, relating to antibiotic compounds and their uses, and one related foreign patent and seven related foreign patent applications, which are owned by us, and which, if granted with respect to the patent applications, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, are expected to expire in 2034;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | six U.S. patents and five U.S. patent applications, relating to methods for treating an eye disease or disorder by injecting or instilling a drug delivery system, and 11 related foreign patents, and 47 related foreign patent applications, which are exclusively sub‑licensed from GrayBug Vision, Inc., and which, if granted with respect to the patent applications, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, are expected to expire beginning in 2031 through 2036; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | six U.S. patents and nine U.S. patent applications, related to our AMPPLIFY technology, and 16 related foreign patents and 31 related foreign patent applications, which are exclusively in‑licensed from JHU, and which, if granted with respect to the patent applications, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, are expected to expire beginning in 2025 through 2036.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non‑provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in 

 
  26

 
certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch‑Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. We cannot provide any assurance that any patent term extension with respect to any U.S. patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension.
 Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, if permitted under the applicable laws, regulations, and rules and depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. The expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us. However, we cannot provide any assurances that any such patent term extension of any patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension.
 Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. License Agreements
 The Johns Hopkins University
 In November 2009, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with JHU, which was amended in November 2012, May 2014, August 2014, and June 2018 and amended in part by the JHU settlement agreement described below. We refer to the amended license agreement with JHU as the JHU license agreement. Pursuant to the JHU license agreement, JHU granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under specified patent rights covering various aspects of MPP technology, to research, develop, make, use and sell products and provide services in any field. JHU also granted us a non‑exclusive license to use specified know‑how with limits on JHU’s right to license the know‑how to other commercial entities. Financial Terms
 In connection with the JHU license agreement, we paid JHU an upfront license fee in the low tens of thousands of dollars and issued to JHU a low single digit percentage of our common stock. We also reimbursed JHU for the prosecution and maintenance costs incurred by JHU for the licensed patent rights prior to our entering into the JHU license agreement, and we are responsible for all of the ongoing costs relating to the prosecution and maintenance of the JHU patent rights licensed to us. We paid JHU fees in the low tens of thousands of dollars upon entering into certain of the amendments to the JHU license agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we also have paid JHU an aggregate of approximately $337,000 in minimum annual royalty fees and development milestones and are obligated to pay fees upon achievement of additional specified development milestones and achievement of specified commercial milestones under the license agreement.
 In connection with the JHU license agreement and the JHU settlement agreement described below, we are obligated to make certain future payments to JHU. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we paid JHU a minimum annual royalty 

 
  27

 
fee of approximately $38,000, and we are obligated to pay JHU annual minimum royalties that will not exceed approximately $113,000 per year in the future. In addition, we must pay JHU a tiered royalty rate in the low single‑digits on annual sales by us or our affiliates of products or services covered by a valid issued claim, or certain pending claims, of a licensed JHU patent right in the country of sale, from which we may, under specified circumstances, offset portions of amounts we must pay as royalties on other patent rights in order to commercialize a licensed product or licensed service up to a maximum reduction of a mid‑double digit percentage. We must also pay a percentage, in the high single digits, of certain consideration we or our affiliates receive from sublicensing rights under the licensed JHU intellectual property, subject to specified offsets and deductions. We may offset against each minimum annual payment the royalties and sublicense income that we pay to JHU in the preceding twelve‑month period. We also are obligated to pay to JHU certain milestone payments, which will not exceed approximately $1.9 million in the aggregate, if certain development and commercial events are achieved. The JHU patent rights sublicensed to us by GrayBug under the JHU settlement agreement described below are considered in the same way as the JHU patent rights directly licensed to us by JHU for purposes of determining these payments.
 Diligence Obligations
 We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and introduce the licensed products and licensed services to the market, including developing licensed products suitable for different indications, consistent with sound and reasonable business practice and judgment, and, after introducing a licensed product or licensed service into the market, we must endeavor to keep licensed products and licensed services reasonably available to the public consistent with sound and reasonable business practice and judgment. Term and Termination
 The JHU license agreement will expire on a country‑by‑country basis upon the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent in such country or, if no licensed patent issues in such country, then in November 2029. Either we or JHU may terminate the JHU license agreement for the other party’s breach that is not cured within specified time periods or if the other party is subject to certain bankruptcy protections. In addition, we may terminate the JHU license agreement, for any reason, upon 90 days’ prior written notice to JHU. Assignment and Exclusive License
 In April of 2017 we assigned to JHU certain Kala‑owned patent applications and our interest in certain patents and patent applications formerly co‑owned by JHU and Kala, unifying ownership of the assigned patent rights in JHU’s name. As part of the assignment of these patent rights to JHU, Kala was granted an exclusive, non‑royalty bearing, sub‑licensable license from JHU under all of the patent rights Kala assigned in this transaction, which will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent under the new license. No fees were paid to JHU for this exclusive license. GrayBug Vision, Inc. and The Johns Hopkins University
 A dispute arose between us, JHU, and GrayBug Vision, Inc. (formerly known as GrayBug, LLC and GrayBug, Inc.), or GrayBug, over rights licensed to us and GrayBug under certain patent rights owned by JHU. In October 2014, we, GrayBug, and JHU resolved this matter by entering into a Settlement and License Agreement, which was amended in January 2015, which we refer to as the JHU settlement agreement.
 Under the JHU settlement agreement, GrayBug granted us, under specified patent rights that are exclusively licensed to GrayBug by JHU in all fields, an exclusive, worldwide royalty‑free sublicense in the field of use of a particle with specified characteristics for delivery of a biologically active material through mucus, mucin, or a mucosal barrier where such delivery does not involve administration via injection to the eye, which we refer to as the Kala sublicense field. In December 2017, GrayBug terminated its exclusive license from JHU as to one patent family among these patent rights. Pursuant to the JHU settlement agreement, these patent rights are now automatically directly licensed to us under the terms of the JHU license agreement, and we are now responsible for all future patent prosecution costs for these patent rights. In turn, pursuant to the JHU settlement agreement we granted GrayBug, under specified patent rights that 

 
  28

 
are exclusively licensed to us by JHU in all fields, an exclusive, worldwide royalty‑free sublicense in the field of use of a particle with specified characteristics for delivery of a biologically active material to the eye via injection, excluding any particle comprising or consisting of loteprednol etabonate, which we refer to as the GrayBug sublicense field. In addition, JHU granted us, under the terms of the JHU license agreement, an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain additional specified patent rights relating to further aspects of MPP technology in the Kala sublicense field. JHU also granted to GrayBug a similar license under these same patent rights in the GrayBug sublicense field. In January 2017, GrayBug terminated its license under all but one patent family in these additional specified patent rights, and in July 2017, GrayBug terminated its license under the remaining patent family. As a result, for those patent rights terminated by GrayBug, we are now licensed in both the Kala sublicense field and the GrayBug sublicense field. JHU also granted us certain rights to obtain a non‑exclusive license to certain additional patent rights and, if we obtain such a license, we would have the exclusive right to negotiate for a specified time period an exclusive license under such patent rights in the Kala sublicense field. Under the JHU settlement agreement, we agreed not to exercise our rights under the JHU patent rights licensed or sublicensed to us to use a particular active ingredient. Each party to the JHU settlement agreement may sublicense the rights granted to it pursuant to the JHU settlement agreement, subject to notice requirements and the requirement that any such sublicense must involve some aspect of collaboration, joint research, development, manufacture, partnership or the like. In any event, sublicenses beyond a specified number of tiers are not permitted without the original licensing party’s written consent.
 We, GrayBug and JHU each released the others, and certain persons affiliated with them, from any claims and losses known to the releasing party as of the effective date of the JHU settlement agreement in connection with the dispute that led to the JHU settlement agreement.
 Financial Terms
 The JHU settlement agreement also amended certain of our financial obligations under the JHU license agreement, which we have reflected in the description above. Neither we nor GrayBug owe the other any royalties, milestone payments or other payments with respect to the sublicenses and other rights granted to each other. In addition, JHU agreed that we are not responsible for paying to JHU any sublicense fees or other payments due under our JHU license agreement that may otherwise have arisen as a result of our granting GrayBug the sublicenses under the JHU settlement agreement.
 For the specified patent rights directly licensed to us by JHU in the Kala sublicense field under the JHU settlement agreement, we reimbursed JHU for a portion of the patent prosecution and maintenance costs incurred prior to entering the JHU settlement agreement, and we are responsible for all of the ongoing prosecution and maintenance costs of any of these JHU patent rights for which there is no other direct licensee of JHU, such as the JHU patent rights licensed to us in both the Kala sublicense field and the GrayBug sublicense field.
 Term and Termination
 The JHU settlement agreement will expire upon the expiration of all the patent rights that are the subject of the JHU settlement agreement. We may terminate one or more of the licenses or sublicenses granted to us in the JHU settlement agreement on a country‑by‑country basis for convenience upon 30 days’ prior written notice to GrayBug. We or GrayBug may terminate one or more the sublicenses granted to the other party under the JHU patent rights if the other party, or its employees, officers, directors, agents or representatives, takes certain steps to oppose, attempt to invalidate or prevent the issuance of any of the patent rights directly licensed to the terminating party by JHU. Government Regulation and Product Approvals
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, 

 
  29

 
along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Approval and Regulation of Drugs in the United States
 In the United States, drug products are regulated under the FDCA and applicable implementing regulations and guidance. The failure of an applicant to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including non-clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post-approval process, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, the FDA’s refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines and civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA or Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other government entities, including state agencies.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps before the product candidate will be approved by the FDA:

· | preclinical testing including laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations and standards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a NDA for a drug product which includes not only the results of the clinical trials, but also, detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labelling for one or more proposed indication(s);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product candidate or components thereof are manufactured to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of clinical data in support of the NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA to allow marketing of the new drug product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies
 Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 The IND and IRB Processes
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an 

 
  31

 
institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides recommendations as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application.
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended) a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect.  This provision requires drug and biologic companies to make publicly available their policies for expanded access for individual patient access to products intended for serious diseases. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA  approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements which include, among other things, the 

 
  32

 
requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval.
 Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the investigational drug product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
 Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population.
 Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a drug: such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.”
 In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
 Progress reports detailing the status and a brief description of available results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or completed at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate 

 
  33

 
packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Review and Approval of an NDA
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides sufficient data establishing the safety, purity and potency of the proposed drug product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 The NDA is a vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new drug product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2019 is $309,915 Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
 Following submission of an NDA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which the FDA accepts the application for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of products that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that the FDA receives the application. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.  Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report.
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity.

 
  34

 

 The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation.
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case‑by‑case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment‑limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.

 Accelerated Approval Pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. Thus, the benefit of accelerated approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with priority review.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post‑approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post‑approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure 

 
  36

 
that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU.  ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Post-Approval Regulation
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that 

 
  37

 
are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information.
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.

Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
 NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”
 Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

 
  38

 
Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
 The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight (8) months for a drug that has three (3) or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of ‘‘competitor generic therapies’’ or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.

 
  39

 

 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

· | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


· | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.

For drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety (90) days after FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of 

 
  40

 
deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.

The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits an NDA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the NDA if the drug is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.  The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary efficacy to inform pediatric labeling for the product.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.    Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must seek orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the candidate product. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different conditions. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term 

 
  41

 
restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
 FDA approval and regulation of companion diagnostics
 If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling.
 If the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics Device Evaluation and Safety.
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval.
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If 

 
  42

 
the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.

Health care Law and Regulation
 Health care providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the following:

· | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing ·or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  43

 


· | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to health care items or services that are reimbursed by non-government third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Health Care Reform
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 The containment of health care costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the health care system in the United States.
 In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are:

· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% (and 70% starting January 1, 2019) point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.”  The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise.  Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the 

 
  45

 
annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices.  Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. The Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA during the next Congressional session.
 The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA.  Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on May 11, 2018, the Administration issued a plan to lower drug prices. Under this blueprint for action, the Administration indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services will: take steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies; advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition; evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers’ ads to enhance price competition; speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers; avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid; work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers; examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans, and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program; update Medicare’s drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency; prohibit Part D contracts that include “gag rules” that prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance; and require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases.
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.  We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.

 Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union (“EU”) generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU.

Clinical Trial Approval
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. The Regulation was published on June 16, 2014 but is not expected to apply until 2019. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and replacing any national legislation that was put in place to implement the Directive.  Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which on-going clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU Portal and Database”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the appointed reporting Member State, whose assessment report is submitted for review by the sponsor and all other competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States). Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the Concerned Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 PRIME Designation in the EU
 In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist.  The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure.  Products from 

 
  47

 
small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies.  Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted.  Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) or Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level.  A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
 Marketing Authorization
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across the European Economic Area (i.e. the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, ATMPs and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.   The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases.  We anticipate that the centralized procedure will be mandatory for the product candidates we are developing.
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a final opinion from the CHMP, the European Commission must prepare a draft decision concerning an application for marketing authorization. This draft decision must take the opinion and any relevant provisions of EU law into account. Before arriving at a final decision on an application for centralized authorization of a medicinal product the European Commission must consult the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use. The Standing Committee is composed of representatives of the EU Member States and chaired by a non-voting European Commission representative. The European Parliament also has a related “droit de regard”. The European Parliament's role is to ensure that the European Commission has not exceeded its powers in deciding to grant or refuse to grant a marketing authorization.
 The European Commission may grant a so-called “marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances”. Such authorization is intended for products for which the applicant can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indications for which the 

 
  48

 
product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Consequently, marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following:

· | the applicant must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radiopharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is subject to annual review to reassess the risk-benefit balance in an annual reassessment procedure. Continuation of the authorization is linked to the annual reassessment and a negative assessment could potentially result in the marketing authorization being suspended or revoked. The renewal of a marketing authorization of a medicinal product under exceptional circumstances, however, follows the same rules as a “normal” marketing authorization. Thus, a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is granted for an initial five years, after which the authorization will become valid indefinitely, unless the EMA decides that safety grounds merit one additional five-year renewal.
 The European Commission may also grant a so-called “conditional marketing authorization” prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (i) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (iii) the product fulfills an unmet medical need and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization.
 The EU medicines rules expressly permit the EU Member States to adopt national legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale, supply or use of any medicinal product containing, consisting of or derived from a specific type of human or animal cell, such as embryonic stem cells. While the products we have in development do not make use of embryonic stem cells, it is possible that the national laws in certain EU Member States may prohibit or restrict us from commercializing our products, even if they have been granted an EU marketing authorization.
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.

 The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.
 Regulatory Data Protection in the EU
 In the EU, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abridged) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals
 A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU n market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA‑approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product‑specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so‑called Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the Centralized Procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in

the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a drug can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
 Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity
 Regulatory Requirements after a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
 In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include:

· | Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and EU Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU.

  Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU (which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU will take effect either 

 
  51

 
on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty. Discussions between the United Kingdom and the EU focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements are ongoing. However, limited progress to date in these negotiations and ongoing uncertainty within the UK Government and Parliament sustains the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the EU on March 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption.
 Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.
 Pricing Decisions for Approved Products
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries. General Data Protection Regulation
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
