ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
Corporate Background and General Business Overview
 
Our Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 8, 2014 to engage in the development and operation of a business engaged in the distribution of glass craft products produced in China. We are a development stage company and also considered an Emerging Growth Company. Our fiscal year end is July 31st. We have an office located at 3A, 171-173 Lockhard Road, Kingswell Commercial Tower, Wanchai, Hong Kong. On Our President and CEO, Chi Ming Tso, oversees the implementation of the business strategy and is responsible for the development of new initiatives and future expansion of the Companys operations. 
 
Since inception, we have had limited operating activities. Our principal business activities from inception to recently were in the sale of glass craft products. We had supply agreements with three large and well-established suppliers and distributors of glass craft products in China. The term of these agreement began in 2014 and expired in 2018. 
 
Currently, we are in the early stage of development of our new business plan in which we act as an international agent through our wholly owned subsidiary for a Chinese environmental company to market its environmental technologies, equipment and products and to develop projects utilizing its environmental technologies, equipment and products in worldwide markets. As well, we would seek for acquisition by the Chinese environmental company environmental technologies and equipment or technology and equipment integration methodologies.
 
On April 9, 2019 the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with MoralArrival Environmental and Blockchain Technology Services Limited ("MoralArrival"), a British Virgin Islands company and the shareholder of MoralArrival. Under the terms of that Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to exchange 300,000 shares of its common stock for all the outstanding shares of common stock of MoralArrival. As a result of this transaction, MoralArrival would become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. MoralArrival is a recently formed startup company with nominal assets and no history of operations. MoralArrival is in the business of acting as an international agent for a Chinese environmental company, Hengshui Jingzhen Environmental Technology Company Limited of Hebei, China (Hengshui). Hengshui supplies environmental treatment systems and products. It is a comprehensive environmental protection enterprise with technology integrating hazardous waste collection, disposal and utilization. It uses modern technology to efficiently treat hazardous waste and turn waste into energy regeneration. 

On April 10, 2019 the Company sold its shares of its wholly owned subsidiary, Real Capital Limited (Real Capital), for a nominal consideration of One US Dollar (US$1.00). The Company acquired Real Capital on May 8, 2018 with the aim of developing new business opportunities. Real Capital has had no sales revenue for the past few years and a net assets value of minus Forty Two Thousand, One Hundred and Sixty Hong Kong Dollars (HK$42,160) as at January 31, 2019.
 
Our plan of operations over the next 12-month period is to continue to develop and grow our current business activities. We are also continuously looking for other business opportunities. 
 
On July 17, 2019 the Company received the approval from Finra to do a 1:10 forward split of its shares. Prior to the 1:10 forward split, the Company had 6,104,999 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, and after the 1:10 forward split the Company had 61,049,990 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
 
As at July 31, 2019 the Company had 61,049,990 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
 
From the Companys inception on July 8, 2014 to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, the Company had $223,910 in revenues and a net loss of $512,258. From the Companys inception on July 8, 2014 to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, the Company had $223,910 in revenues and a net loss of $136,266.

Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern (see Financial Statements).
 
The Company qualifies as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act). We intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As well, our election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until they apply to private companies. Therefore, as a result of our election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

Management believes the current premises arrangement is sufficient for its needs for at least the next 12 months.

Jobs Act
 
Because we generated less than $1 billion in total annual gross revenues during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.
 
We will lose our emerging growth company status on the earliest occurrence of any of the following events:
 
1. on the last day of any fiscal year in which we earn at least $1 billion in total annual gross revenues, which amount is adjusted for inflation every five years;
 
2. on the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement;
 
3. on the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or
 
4. the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in section 240.12b2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto.
 
A large accelerated filer is an issuer that, at the end of its fiscal year, meets the following conditions:
 
1. it has an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of the issuer's most recently completed second fiscal quarter; 
 
2. It has been subject to the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months; and
 
3. It has filed at least one annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act.

As an emerging growth company, exemptions from the following provisions are available to us:
 
1. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires auditor attestation of internal controls;
 
2. Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation;
 
3. Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the company;
 
4. Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the ratio between the annual total compensation of the CEO and the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the companies; and 
 
5. The requirement to provide certain other executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K. Instead, an emerging growth company must only comply with the more limited provisions of Item 402 applicable to smaller reporting companies, regardless of the issuers size.
 
Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company may choose to forgo such exemption and instead comply with the requirements that apply to an issuer that is not an emerging growth company. 
 
We have elected to maintain our status as an emerging growth company and take advantage of the JOBS Act provisions.
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY - THE JOBS ACT
 -7-

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

 | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A;


 | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth companys internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;


 | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth companys executive compensation arrangements; and


 | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.

 
We may take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies even if we no longer qualify as an "emerging growth company." 
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period provided above and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
 
We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
