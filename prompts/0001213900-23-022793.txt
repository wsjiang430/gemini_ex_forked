Item 1. Business



We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on February 12, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our “initial business combination.” We have reviewed a number of opportunities to enter into an initial business combination; however, we have neither engaged in any operations nor have we generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company,” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. Further, we are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. For more information, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.”



Our executive offices are located at 214 Brazilian Avenue, Suite 200-A, Palm Beach, Florida, 33480, and our telephone number is (561) 805-3588. Our corporate website address is www.colombierspac.com. Our website and the information contained thereon or that can be accessed through the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Company History



Initial Public Offering



On March 19, 2021, we filed a Form S-1 with the SEC indicating our intent to offer three classes of securities: (1) units, each consisting of one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001, and one-third of one redeemable warrant (the “Units”); (2) shares of Class A common stock included as part of the Units (the “Public Shares”); and (3) redeemable warrants included as part of the Units (the “Warrants”). Following a series of correspondence and amendments filed with the SEC on May 7, 2021 and June 3, 2021, the registration statement (as amended) for this initial public offering was declared effective on June 8, 2021 (the “Initial Public Offering”).



On June 11, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 15,000,000 Units, generating gross proceeds of $150,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 5,250,000 Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Warrant in a private placement to our sponsor, Colombier Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $5,250,000 (the “Private Placement Warrants”).



At the closing of the Initial Public Offering on June 11, 2021, due to a clerical error, the Trust Account (as defined below) was overfunded by $1,240,000. The overfunded amount was transferred to our operating account on June 14, 2021.



On July 1, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option related to the Initial Public Offering in full, resulting in the issuance of an additional 2,250,000 Units for an aggregate amount of $22,500,000. In connection with the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option, we also consummated the sale of an additional 450,000 Warrants at $1.00 per Warrant, generating total proceeds of $450,000. A total of $22,500,000 was deposited into a trust account (the “Trust Account”), bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the Trust Account to $172,500,000.



Total costs associated with the Initial Public Offering accruing in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $10,277,418, consisting of (1) $3,450,000 of underwriting fees payable on the date of the Initial Public Offering, (2) $6,037,500 of deferred underwriting fees payable from the proceeds in the Trust Account solely in the event we effectuate an initial business combination, (3) $329,619 of costs associated with the derivative warrant liabilities, and (4) $460,299 of other offering costs.





1







As of December 31, 2022, we had not yet commenced any operations. All activity for the period beginning on February 12, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022 relates to our formation, Initial Public Offering, and, subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a business combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. We have elected December 31 as our fiscal year end.



Our Units, Public Shares and the Warrants are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbols “CLBR.U,” “CLBR,” and “CLBR.WS,” respectively. Our Units began trading on June 11, 2021, and our Public Shares and Warrants began separate trading on the NYSE on July 6, 2021.



Use of Proceeds of the Initial Public Offering



Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on June 11, 2021, an amount of $150,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) representing the net proceeds from the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Warrants in the private placement to the Sponsor was placed in the Trust Account, which is and will be invested in either (1) U.S. government securities within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less, or (2) in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of an initial business combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to our shareholders, as described below. Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward completing a business combination. We must complete one or more initial business combinations with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if applicable, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a business combination. We will only complete a business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully effect a business combination.
Founder Shares



On February 15, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 4,312,500 shares of our Class B common stock (the “Founder Shares”) for an aggregate price of $25,000. At the time of the purchase, the Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 562,500 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriter’s over-allotment option was not exercised in full or in part, so that the Sponsor would collectively own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of our issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering (assuming the Sponsor did not purchase any Public Shares in the Initial Public Offering). As a result of the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option on July 1, 2021, 562,500 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.



The Sponsor has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares (or shares of common stock issuable upon conversion thereof) until the earlier of: (1) one year after the completion of our initial business combination or (2) subsequent to an initial business combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a business combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.

Initial Business Combination



NYSE rules require that an initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if applicable, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount). We refer to this as the “80% of net assets test.” The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our Board of Directors (the “Board”) based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our Board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or from an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.



We will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination.



To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal, and other information which will be made available to us.



We cannot currently ascertain with any degree of certainty the amount of time and associated costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in us incurring losses, which will reduce the funds we can use to attempt to complete another business combination.



We will have until June 11, 2023 to complete a business combination (the “Completion Window” or “Combination Period”) (or until September 11, 2023 if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination prior to June 11, 2023). If we are unable to complete a business combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares at a per share price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, and any amounts used to fund working capital requirements, subject to an annual limit of $1,000,000, and/or to pay our taxes (“Permitted Withdrawals”)), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable laws. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete a business combination within the Combination Period.





3







Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (our “Charter”) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of our Board, which must include a majority of our independent directors, to approve our initial business combination (or such other vote as the applicable law or stock exchange rules then in effect may require). We are not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a business combination. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully effect or complete a business combination.



We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either (i) to complete our initial business combination or (ii) because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares in connection with our initial business combination or a stockholder vote to make certain amendments to our Charter, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. In addition, we intend to target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available to us, including from the Trust Account (net of amounts needed to satisfy redemptions by public stockholders), we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such a proposed initial business combination. We may also obtain financing prior to the closing of our initial business combination to fund our working capital needs and transaction costs in connection with our search for and completion of our initial business combination. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances, or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements into which we may enter. Subject to compliance with the applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account upon expiration of the Combination Period. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.



The terms of our Charter provide a Completion Window of 24 months from the date of closing of our Initial Public Offering (the “IPO Date”), or 27 months from the IPO Date if we have entered into a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the IPO Date. As a result of our entering into the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with PSQ Holdings, Inc. on February 27, 2023 (prior to the 24-month anniversary of the IPO Date), our Completion Window has been automatically extended from June 11, 2023 to September 11, 2023 in accordance with the terms of our Charter.



Lack of Business Diversification



For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business.



Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:




● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive, and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team



Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team (if any) in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated with us in some capacity following our initial business combination, it is highly unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business Operations and Our Search for and Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, an Initial Business Combination - We may seek acquisition opportunities in acquisition targets that may be outside of our management’s areas of expertise.”



We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.



Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination



We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if such approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.

Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required
--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 




Under the NYSE’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:




● | we issue (other than in a public offering for cash) shares of common stock that will either (a) be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of common stock then outstanding or (b) have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then outstanding; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial security holders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of shares of common stock to be issued, or if the number of shares of common stock into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1% of the number of shares of common stock or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our directors and officers or (b) 5% of the number of shares of common stock or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial security holders; or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance will result in our undergoing a change of control. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






5







The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by law will be made by us solely in our discretion. We will base this decision on business and legal rationales, which include a variety of factors, such as:




● | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other time and budget constraints of the company; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Business Combination



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (net of Permitted Withdrawals), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption right will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its Public Shares. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares without voting, and if it does vote, irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our Warrants. Our Sponsor, officers, and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any Public Shares that they hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either: (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us solely in our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval, while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our Charter would typically require stockholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We currently intend to conduct redemptions pursuant to a stockholder vote unless stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons.



If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our Charter:




● | conduct redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to redeem our Public Shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act, we and our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Public Shares in the open market.





6







In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of Public Shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more Public Shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and will not complete such initial business combination.



If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our Charter:




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above. We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, thus providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote, even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration.



If we seek stockholder approval, unless otherwise required by applicable law, regulation, or stock exchange rules, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders, officers, and directors will count towards this quorum, and all have agreed to vote any Founder Shares and any Public Shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds and agreements may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares without voting, and if it does vote, irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination.



Our Charter provides that in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Redemptions of our Public Shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Public Shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceeds the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Public Shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval



Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Charter provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of our shares without our prior consent, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares and/or subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of our shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of our shares, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.



Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights



We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights—whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name”—to either (1) tender their certificates to our transfer agent (a) prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders or (b) up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, in the event we distribute proxy materials; or (2) to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian (“DWAC”) System, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our Public Shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, thus providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their Public Shares.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00, and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their Public Shares. The need to deliver Public Shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.



The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificates. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.

Once made, any request to redeem such shares may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a Public Share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our Public Shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.



If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.



If our proposed initial business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until the end of the Combination Period.



Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination



Our Charter provides that we will have only the time of the Completion Window (the date that is 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or the date that is 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination prior to the date that is 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such period, we will: (1) cease all operations (except for the purpose of winding up); (2) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of Permitted Withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the Completion Window.



The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event we do not complete a business combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).



Our initial stockholders, officers, and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the Completion Window. However, if our initial stockholders or any of our officers, directors, or any of their respective affiliates then hold any Public Shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period.



Our Sponsor, officers, and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our Charter to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our Public Shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the Completion Window, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of Permitted Withdrawals), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares. However, we may not redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination.

We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts held outside the Trust Account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay taxes or make other Permitted Withdrawals, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.



If we were to expend all of funds held outside of the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account and any Permitted Withdrawals or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors -  Risks Relating to Our Business Operations and Our Search for and Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, an Initial Business Combination - If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share.” Under Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.



Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses, or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest, or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that such entities will execute such agreements or, even if they execute such agreements, that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account—including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility, or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts, or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per Public Share in the aggregate or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the Trust Account assets, net of Permitted Withdrawals, except as to any claims by a third party that executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether any such waiver is enforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company; therefore, our Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per Public Share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your Public Shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties, including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.





10







In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below: (1) $10.00 per Public Share in the aggregate; or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the Trust Account assets, net of Permitted Withdrawals, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that in exercising their business judgment, our independent directors may choose not to do so in certain instances. For example, the independent directors may deem the cost of such legal action to be too high relative to the amount recoverable, or the independent directors may determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business Operations and Our Search for and Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, an Initial Business Combination - If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share.”



We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses, or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest, or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As of March 23, 2023, we had access to approximately $175.0 million in the Trust Account with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, which is estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors.



Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the Completion Window may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If we comply with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that we make reasonable provision for all claims against us, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against us, a 90-day period during which we may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.



Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the Completion Window is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law, and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution instead of three years (as in the case of a liquidating distribution). If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the Completion Window, we will: (1) cease all operations, except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible (but not more than ten business days thereafter) redeem the Public Shares at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of Permitted Withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our Public Shares as soon as reasonably possible following the expiration of the Completion Window and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.





11







Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan—based on facts known to us at such time—that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company rather than an operating company, and because our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers and investment bankers, among others) or prospective target businesses. As described above, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses, or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited, and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, our Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below: (1) $10.00 per Public Share; or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in value of the Trust Account assets, net of Permitted Withdrawals, and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.



If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy laws and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our Board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business Operations and Our Search for and Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, an Initial Business Combination - If, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our Board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our Board and us to claims of punitive damages.”



Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earlier to occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination, and then only in connection with those Public Shares that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein; (2) the redemption of any Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our Charter to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our Public Shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the Completion Window; and (3) the redemption of all of our Public Shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the Completion Window, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with our initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating, and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors may possess greater financial, technical, human, and other resources than we have. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation may provide others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination, and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.





12







Employees



We currently have two officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Facilities



We currently maintain our executive offices at 214 Brazilian Avenue, Suite 200-A, Palm Beach, Florida, 33480. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.



Regulation



Emerging Growth Company Status



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have and intend to continue to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until the earliest of: (1) the last day of the first fiscal year in our annual gross revenue exceeds of $1.235 billion; (2) December 31 of the fiscal year that we become a “large accelerated filer,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months; or (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the preceding three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act.



Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



Our Units, Public Shares and Warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site at www.sec.gov that contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.





13







We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or international financial reporting standards as promulgated by the international accounting standards board (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the Completion Window. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.



Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer an emerging growth company will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.



Our Sponsor: Colombier Sponsor LLC



Sponsor Indemnity



In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per Public Share in the aggregate or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the Trust Account assets, less Permitted Withdrawals; provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account, nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses, or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest, or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.
Sponsor Redemption Rights



The Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of an initial business combination, (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or 27 months, under certain circumstances) and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Charter (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if we do not complete a business combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment.
Sponsor Liquidation Rights



The Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if we fail to complete a business combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if we fail to complete a business combination within the Combination Period.
