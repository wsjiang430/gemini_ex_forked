ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Dover Corporation is a diversified global manufacturer delivering innovative equipment and components, specialty systems, consumable supplies, software and digital solutions and support services through three operating segments: Engineered Systems, Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. The Company's entrepreneurial business model encourages, promotes and fosters deep customer engagement and collaboration, which has led to Dover's well-established and valued reputation for providing superior customer service and industry-leading product innovation. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references herein to "Dover," "the Company," and words such as "we," "us," or "our" include Dover Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Dover was incorporated in 1947 in the State of Delaware and became a publicly traded company in 1955. Dover is headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois and currently employs approximately 24,000 people worldwide. 
Dover's three operating segments are structured around our key end markets and are designed to support focused growth strategies. Our segment structure also allows us to leverage Dover's scale and channel presence while capitalizing on productivity initiatives. Dover's three operating segments are as follows: 
•Our Engineered Systems segment is comprised of two platforms, Printing & Identification and Industrials and is focused on the design, manufacture and service of critical equipment, consumables and components serving the fast-moving consumer goods, digital textile printing, vehicle service, environmental solutions and industrial end markets. 
•Our Fluids segment, serving the Fueling & Transport, Pumps, and Process Solutions end markets, is focused on the safe handling of critical fluids across the retail fueling, chemical, hygienic, oil and gas and industrial end markets. 
•Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energy efficient equipment and systems serving the commercial refrigeration and food equipment end markets. 
Spin-off of Energy Businesses
On May 9, 2018, we completed the spin-off of Apergy Corporation ("Apergy") to our shareholders. Apergy holds the entities conducting our former upstream energy businesses previously included in our Energy segment. The transaction was completed through the pro rata distribution of 100% of the common stock of Apergy to Dover's shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 30, 2018. Each Dover shareholder received one share of Apergy common stock for every two shares of Dover common stock held as of the record date. For more details, see Note 2 — Spin-off of Apergy Corporation in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
Management Philosophy 
Dover is committed to generating shareholder value through a combination of sustained long-term profitable growth, operational excellence and superior free cash-flow generation. We foster an operating culture with high ethical standards that values accountability, rigor, trust, respect and open communications, designed to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness. Dover seeks to be a leader in our end markets as measured by market share, customer satisfaction, growth, and return on invested capital. Our operating structure of three business segments allows for focused acquisition activity, accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies, including global sourcing and supply chain integration, shared services, and manufacturing, and advances the development of our executive talent. Our segment and executive management teams set strategic direction, initiatives and goals, provide oversight of strategy execution and achievement of these goals for our operating companies, and with oversight from our Board of Directors, make capital allocation decisions, including organic investment initiatives, major capital projects, acquisitions and the return of capital to our shareholders. 
We are also committed to creating sustainable business practices that protect the environment, and through the development of products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals. We have accelerated our efforts and processes around innovation, focusing on technologies which create tangible value for our customers. Each of Dover’s segments is dedicated to this important initiative. In our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, SWEP, a manufacturer of brazed plate heat exchangers, focuses on the conversion to sustainable and renewable energy usage in heat transfer. Their Passive Cooling
 Unit, for example, uses natural cooling from the ground or groundwater to remove excess heat from interiors with the process requiring only a small amount of electricity for the circulation pumps which make this solution both very energy efficient and cost effective. Over the last 7 years, Markem-Imaje, a marking and coding business within Dover’s Engineered Systems segment, has reduced its carbon emissions by 40% and produced 18% less waste by implementing an Environmental, Health and Safety program. Lastly, in Dover’s Fluids segment, OPW, a leader in fluid handling and car wash equipment, released the 14 Series fueling nozzle family that features patented and patent-pending technology to prevent dripping of excess fuel while motorists refuel their vehicles. 
Company Goals
We are committed to driving shareholder returns through three key objectives. First, we are committed to achieving organic sales growth above that of gross domestic product (or 3% to 5% annually on average) over a long-term business cycle, absent prolonged adverse economic conditions, complemented by growth through strategic acquisitions. Second, we continue to focus on improving returns on capital and segment margins through effective cost management and productivity initiatives, including supply chain activities, targeted, thoughtful restructuring activities, strategic pricing and portfolio management. Third, we aim to generate free cash flow as a percentage of sales of approximately 8-12% through strong earnings performance, productivity improvements and active working capital management. Dover’s value-creation strategy is supported by a financial policy that includes a prudent approach to financial leverage, and a disciplined approach to capital allocation that allows for a balance between reinvestment and return of capital to shareholders. We support achievement of these goals by (1) aligning management compensation with financial objectives, (2) executing on well-defined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes and (3) investing in talent development programs.
Business Strategy 
To achieve our goals, we are focused on executing the following three pillars of Dover’s business strategy: 
Capturing growth potential in our key end markets and adjacencies
Dover’s three business segments focus on building enduring competitive advantages and leadership positions in end markets that are positioned for future growth. We believe that our businesses are among the top suppliers in most markets and niches that we serve (as defined by customer applications, geographies or products), which positions us well to capture future growth in such markets. We capitalize on our engineering, technology and design expertise and maintain an intense focus on meeting the needs of our customers and adding significant value to their operations through superior product performance, safety and reliability and a commitment to after sales and service support. We cultivate and maintain an entrepreneurial culture and continuously innovate to address our customers’ needs to help them win in the markets they serve.
In particular, our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on growing industrial manufacturing and trade volumes, continuous productivity improvement, adoption of digital technologies and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), sustainability and safety, energy efficiency, consumer product safety and growth of the middle class and consumption in emerging economies. Our Engineered Systems segment combines its engineering capabilities, unique product advantages and niche applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including conversion to digital textile printing, productivity solutions, sustainability, consumer product safety and growth in emerging economies. Our Fluids segment is focused on accelerating growth within the chemical/plastics, retail fueling, fluid transfer, industrial and hygienic markets as well as globalizing brands across geographies while expanding sales channels and engineering support. Specifically, we focus on capturing growth in the retail fueling, hygienic and pharma and polymers/plastics markets. Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment is responding to our customers’ demand for increased energy efficiency and sustainability and unique merchandising solutions with innovative new products.
We aim to grow by making organic investments in research and development, developing new products and technologies, expanding our geographic coverage, as well as by pursuing disciplined strategic acquisitions that enhance our portfolio and position Dover for long-term growth. We continually evaluate how our assets and capabilities can position Dover to grow in markets adjacent to our core businesses (for example, new applications, geographies, product segments or adjacent technologies) where Dover can be advantaged.
Improving profitability and return on invested capital 
We are committed to generating sustainable returns on invested capital well above the cost of capital across all of our businesses. We continually evaluate and pursue opportunities to improve efficiency, margin and return on capital. We are intensely focused on driving operational excellence and capturing the benefits of common ownership across our businesses. We have implemented numerous productivity initiatives, such as supply chain integration management, shared service centers and lean manufacturing principles, to maximize our efficiency as well as workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees. Our businesses place strong emphasis on continual product quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and to facilitate expansion into new product and geographic markets. Further, we continue to make significant investments in talent development, especially in the area of operational management, and recognize that the growth and development of our employees is essential for our continued success.
In 2018, we launched a margin expansion program, designed to reduce our selling, general and administrative cost base and rationalize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint across the portfolio. In prior years, we have invested in our global supply chain organization to capitalize on Dover’s scale in procurement, and in Dover Business Services shared service centers to provide important transactional and value-added services to our operating companies in the areas of finance, information technology and human resources. Our shared service model allows us to leverage scale across Dover, increase process efficiencies through technology and specialization and reduce risk through centralized controls. Our shared service centers serve our operating companies by freeing resources normally dedicated to transactional services to allow those resources to focus on customers, markets and product excellence.
Additionally, we focus on improving margins and returns by rigorously capturing synergies from our acquisitions and providing best-in-class corporate support and services through a lean corporate center.
Disciplined capital allocation 
Our businesses generate annual free cash flow of approximately 8-12% of revenue. We are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize returns on investment. To do this, we prioritize organic reinvestment to grow and strengthen our existing businesses. We plan to make average annual investments in capital spending of approximately 2% - 4% of revenue with a focus on internal projects designed to expand markets, develop products and improve productivity. We also seek to deploy capital in disciplined acquisitions in our key end markets which include industrials, printing & identification, pumps, hygienic & pharma, fueling & transport, and process solutions markets. Dover focuses primarily on bolt-on acquisitions, applying strict selection criteria of market attractiveness (including growth, maturity, performance-based competition), business fit (including sustained leading position, revenue visibility, favorable customer value-add versus switching cost or risk) and financial return profile (accretive growth and margins, double-digit return on capital). Finally, we have consistently returned cash to shareholders by paying dividends, which have increased annually over each of the last 63 years. We also undertake opportunistic share repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy, and completed $1 billion of share repurchases in 2018. We employ a prudent financial policy to support our capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining an investment grade credit rating.
Portfolio Development 
Acquisitions
Our acquisition program has two key elements. As a first priority, we seek to acquire attractive add-on businesses with a strong fit that enhance our existing franchises either by increasing their reach and customer access, by broadening their product mix or by enhancing technological capability and customer value-add. Second, in the right circumstances, we may strategically pursue larger, stand-alone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces. With all our acquisitions, we seek businesses that have an accretive margin and a strong organic growth profile, offer significant synergy opportunities and the potential to generate double-digit return on capital 3-5 years after the acquisition is completed.
Over the past three years (2016 through 2018), we have spent approximately $1.7 billion to purchase 10 businesses. During 2018, we acquired two businesses for an aggregate consideration of $68.6 million, net of cash acquired. Consistent with our acquisition program, we acquired these businesses to complement and expand upon existing operations within the Process Solutions and Food Equipment end markets. During 2017, we acquired two businesses for an aggregate consideration of $32.9 million, net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration. We acquired these businesses to complement and expand upon existing operations within the Printing and Identification platform. During 2016, we acquired six businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $1.6 billion, net of cash acquired. Four of these businesses– Tokheim Group S.A.S., Fairbanks Environmental LTD, ProGauge and Wayne Fueling Systems Ltd. expanded our Fluids segment's retail fueling portfolio and two of these businesses – Alliance Wireless Technologies, Inc. and Ravaglioli S.p.A. Group complemented the Industrials platform within our Engineered Systems segment. For more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past three years, see Note 4 — Acquisitions in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
Our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses that expand the scope of our offering and make us an even more important supplier to our customers. While we expect to generate annual organic growth of 3% - 5% over a long-term business cycle absent extraordinary adverse economic conditions, our success in consistently growing the portfolio is also dependent on the ability to acquire and integrate businesses successfully within our existing structure. To track post-merger integration and accountability, we utilize an internal scorecard and defined processes to help ensure expected synergies are realized and value is created.
Dispositions
Occasionally, we may also sell or divest some of our businesses based on changes in specific market outlook, structural changes in financial performance, value-creation potential, or for other strategic considerations, which may include an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets or focus on our higher margin growth spaces. We also recognize that some smaller niche businesses in Dover’s portfolio may have a greater value-creation potential if owned by another parent with a larger presence and focus on a given niche. We pragmatically consider such opportunities as part of our ongoing portfolio management and review processes and execute divestitures if the value created is determined to be at an appropriate premium to the value of such business to Dover and allows Dover shareholders to participate in the future value-creation potential from a change in ownership. 
During the past three years (2016 through 2018) we have sold businesses for aggregate cash consideration of $583.0 million. During 2018, there were no other material dispositions aside from the spin-off of Apergy as previously discussed. The financial position and results of operations for Apergy have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. During 2017, we completed the sale of Performance Motorsports International and the consumer and industrial winch business of Warn Industries, within the Engineered Systems segment, as well as other smaller divestitures. During 2016, we completed the sale of Texas Hydraulics and Tipper Tie, within the Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments, respectively. The disposal in 2017 and 2016 did not represent strategic shifts in operations and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations. For more details, see Note 5 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
Business Segments 
As noted previously, we currently operate through three business segments that are aligned with the key end markets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments: Engineered Systems, Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. For financial information about our segments and geographic areas, see Note 18 — Segment Information in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
Engineered Systems 
Our Engineered Systems segment is focused on the design, manufacture and service of critical equipment, consumables and components across its two platforms, the Printing & Identification and Industrials, as described below.
• Printing & Identification – Our Printing & Identification businesses are worldwide suppliers of precision marking and coding, digital textile printing, soldering and dispensing equipment and related consumables and services. Our Printing & Identification platform primarily designs and manufactures equipment and consumables used for printing variable information (such as bar coding of dates and serial numbers) on fast-moving consumer goods, capitalizing
 on expanding food and product safety requirements and growth in emerging markets. In addition, our businesses serving the textile market are benefiting from a significant shift from analog to digital printing, resulting from shorter runs and more complex fashion designs, as well as increasing environmental standards.
•Industrials – Our Industrials businesses provide a wide range of products and services which have broad customer applications across a number of markets including; vehicle service, environmental solutions, industrial automation, defense and telecommunications, and winch and hoist.
Our businesses serving the global vehicle service market provide products and services used primarily in vehicle repair and maintenance, including light and heavy-duty vehicle lifts, wheel service equipment, vehicle diagnostics and vehicle collision repair solutions. Products are sold to national dealership networks, original equipment manufacturers ("OEM"), national multi-shop operators ("MSO") groups, independent repair and service shops, and large national accounts and government/transit customers through a network of distributors and channel partners.
Our businesses serving the environmental solutions markets provide products and digital services for the refuse collection industry and for on-site processing and compaction of trash and recyclable materials. Products are sold to municipal customers, national accounts and independent waste haulers through a network of distributors and directly in certain geographic areas.
The businesses in the industrial automation market provide a wide range of modular automation components including manual clamps, power clamps, rotary and linear mechanical indexers, conveyors, pick and place units, glove ports and manipulators, as well as end-of-arm robotic grippers, slides and end effectors. These products serve a very broad market including food processing, packaging, paper processing, medical, electronic, automotive, nuclear and general industrial products.
Engineered Systems' products are manufactured primarily in the United States, Europe and Asia and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors.
Fluids 
Our Fluids segment is focused on the safe handling of critical fluids across the retail fueling, chemical, hygienic, oil and gas and industrial end markets. We strive to optimize safety, efficiency, reliability, and environmental sustainability through innovative fluid handling and information management solutions. The segment serves three broad global end markets: Fueling & Transport, Pumps, and Process Solutions.
•Fueling & Transport – Our businesses provide fully integrated fluid handling solutions from refineries and chemical-processing plants through point-to-point transfers, transportation, and delivery to the final point of consumption. Within this framework, we have a very strong presence in the retail and commercial fueling markets, where we provide fuel dispensers, payment systems, hanging hardware and underground containment systems, as well as monitoring and optimization software.
• Pumps – Our businesses manufacture pumps that are used to transfer liquid and bulk products and are sold to a wide variety of markets, including the refined fuels, liquefied petroleum gas ("LPG"), food/sanitary, transportation and chemical process industries. The pumps include positive displacement and centrifugal pumps that are used in demanding and specialized fluid transfer process applications. Within this framework, we also have a focus on pumps and connectors for use in a variety of bio-processing, medical and specialty applications.
• Process Solutions – Our businesses specialize in the manufacturing of pumps, filtration systems, pelletizing equipment, compressors and bearings for use in the chemical, polymer, power generation, oil and gas, industrial, and marine industries. These highly engineered products provide unique and proprietary solutions to solve customer needs around the world.
Fluids' products are manufactured primarily in the United States, Europe, China, Mexico and Brazil and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors and OEMs.
Refrigeration & Food Equipment
Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energy-efficient equipment and systems serving the commercial refrigeration and food equipment end markets.
•Refrigeration – Our businesses manufacture refrigeration systems, refrigeration display cases, specialty glass, commercial glass refrigerator and freezer doors and brazed plate heat exchangers used for industrial and climate control.
•Food Equipment – Our businesses manufacture electrical distribution products and engineering services, commercial food service equipment, continuous motion wash systems, cook-chill production systems, custom food storage and preparation products, kitchen ventilation systems, conveyer systems and beverage can-making machinery.
The majority of the refrigeration/food systems and machinery that are manufactured or serviced by the Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment are used by the retail food industry, including supermarkets, “big-box” retail and convenience stores, the commercial/industrial refrigeration industry, institutional and commercial food service and food production markets and beverage can-making industries. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's products are manufactured primarily in North America, Europe and Asia and are sold globally, directly and through a network of distributors. 
Raw Materials 
We use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished components, which are generally available from a number of sources. As a result, shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had, and are not likely to have, a material impact on operating profits. While the required raw materials are generally available, commodity pricing can be volatile, particularly for various grades of steel, copper, aluminum and select other commodities. Although cost increases in commodities may be recovered through increased prices to customers, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. We attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global supply chain activities. 
Research and Development 
Our businesses invest to develop innovative products, as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs, including demand for energy-efficient products designed to help customers meet sustainability goals, expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally, maintain or extend competitive advantages, improve product reliability and reduce production costs.
Our Engineered Systems segment expends significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high. Our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation, and performance and total cost of ownership improvement. The result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period. 
Our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives. These businesses concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes. Most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the Engineered Systems segment. 
In addition to product innovation, we are also investing in developing digital technologies. In 2018, we opened our new digital labs center in the greater Boston area. The facility serves as the hub for our digital strategy and platform, and as a research and development center for our Markem-Imaje business unit which is part of our Engineered Systems segment. We believe that the digital labs center will enhance the effectiveness of our products and fuel our commercial growth strategy by helping us make progress on digitization opportunities and by providing machine learning, artificial intelligence, IoT and digital commerce capabilities. Our businesses pursue digital strategies based on customer needs and will now be able to leverage cross-company capabilities developed at the digital labs center. For example, with the support of the digital labs center, Hydro, which manufacturers chemical injecting, proportioning, dispensing and medicating equipment within our Fluids segment, launched Hydro Connect in 2018. Hydro Connect is a cloud-based IIoT platform that gives end users
 increased visibility into their operations, optimizes production, reduces costs and increases customer satisfaction. Building on this momentum, we launched a digital initiative in 2018 to help our businesses increase sales and further improve customer satisfaction through digital technology, starting with Dover Food Retail within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment.
Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets 
Our businesses own many patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over a number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various times over a number of years. A large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents, unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate. In addition, a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships. While our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success, the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships, or any group of related rights or relationships, is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis. We believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements, new product development and improved manufacturing techniques, as well as strong sales, marketing and service efforts, are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve.
Customers 
We serve thousands of customers, none of which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2018. Given our diversity of served markets, customer concentrations are not significant. Businesses supplying the environmental solutions, agricultural, defense, energy, automotive and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries. This also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation and chemical industries. In the other markets served, there is usually a much lower concentration of customers, particularly where our companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of end-use applications. 
Seasonality 
In general, our businesses, while not strongly seasonal, tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, particularly those serving the transportation, construction, environmental solutions, commercial refrigeration and food service markets. Our businesses serving the retail fueling market tend to increase sequentially through the year based on the historical purchasing patterns of their customers. Our businesses serving the major equipment markets, such as power generation, chemical and processing industries, have longer lead times geared to seasonal, commercial, or consumer demands and customers in these markets tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends that tend to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns. 
Backlog
Backlog is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have long-term contracts, primarily for the markets within our Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. Our total backlog relating to our businesses as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.
Competition
Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served. In general, most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies, and the key competitive factors are customer service, product quality, price and innovation. However, as we become increasingly global, we are exposed to more competition. A summary of our key competitors by end market within each of our segments follows:

Our international operations are subject to certain risks, such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and non-U.S. governmental restrictions, which are discussed further in Item 1A. "Risk Factors." For additional details regarding our non-U.S. revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations, see Note 18 — Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Environmental Matters 
Sustainability
We are committed to creating economic value for shareholders by developing products designed to help our customers meet their sustainability goals in response to evolving regulatory and environmental standards. We believe that sustainability-driven innovation presents a significant growth opportunity while contributing positively to enhanced resource efficiency and reduced waste. Accordingly, over the past several years, we have accelerated our efforts and processes around innovation, focusing on technologies that create tangible value for our customers. Each of Dover’s segments is dedicated to this initiative. For example, in our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, SWEP, a manufacturer of brazed plate heat exchangers, has facilitated its customers’ conversion to more sustainable and renewable energy usage through heat transfer technology. SWEP’s Passive Cooling Unit uses natural cooling from the ground or groundwater to remove excess heat from interiors. The process requires only a small amount of electricity for circulation pumps which makes this solution both energy efficient and cost effective. Over the last seven years, Markem-Imaje, a marking and coding business within our Engineered Systems segment, has reduced its carbon emissions by 40% and produced 18% less waste by implementing an Environmental, Health and Safety program. Lastly, in our Fluids segment, OPW, a leader in fluid handling and car wash equipment, released the 14 Series fueling nozzle family that features patented and patent-pending technology to prevent dripping of excess fuel while motorists refuel their vehicles. 
We are also committed to fostering sustainable business practices across our businesses in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. In 2010, in response to our concerns around global sustainability, we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of our greenhouse gas emissions. Since then, we have evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities, as well as developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes goals, objectives and related projects for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. To further promote our sustainability efforts, we have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20% from 2010 to 2020. We are near our goal for reducing overall energy intensity and have surpassed our goal for reducing greenhouse gas intensity. We believe that our focus on sustainability results in enhanced efficiency in our operations, which reduces costs, improves margins and helps us achieve operational excellence. We will continue to work proactively to reduce energy usage and carbon emissions amidst acquisition and business growth. We have also participated as a voluntary respondent in the Carbon Disclosure Project since 2010 and have maintained our scoring range since we began reporting. 
All of our segments assess the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the opportunities associated with the use of their products and services by customers. In some instances, our businesses may be able to help customers reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Increased demand for energy-efficient products based on a variety of drivers could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses. 
Other Matters
Our operations are governed by a variety of international, national, state and local environmental laws. We are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws. In a few instances, particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances. Where necessary, these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance. 
There have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment. We are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehouse/distribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses. We anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short- to medium-term. We expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in "pass through" costs from energy suppliers, suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations. 
Employees
We had approximately 24,000 employees as of December 31, 2018.
