Product Overview
 
The business of the Company is making unique products to be sold to both mass-market customers and individual clients in the future.  We focus on something that is socially and environmentally responsible, so we are contributing to the solution and not adding to the problem. All of our paper products are 100% recycled. They do not have any smell. They are made up of 70% fiber from elephant dung and 30% post-consumer paper. All papers everywhere are made from a pulp mixture derived from fiber materials. The most common papers today come from wood fiber pulp from cut trees. Our fibers of choice, of course, are dung fibers. We use the dung fibers from elephants to make our dung paper products.
 
The main business of our subsidiary is cannabis cultivation and distribution. Switzerland has the highest allowed legislative THC content in Europe (1%) for sales of cannabis products in retail outlets (without medical receipt). This makes Switzerland an ideal geographic location to manufacture cannabis products, with an intent to scale the business into worldwide distribution. 
 
Various diluted sequences of THC/CBD ratio can be produced to match legislation and regulation on individual markets with other permitted levels of THC. This allows for worldwide production of OTC (over-the-counter) products - for example CBD oils, as well as retail branded cannabis cigarettes, and other health related supplements.

 At the moment Grow Factory is getting ready for the distribution of 4 gr. and 12 gr. flowerhead packages under the brand name Alpine Cannabis. The Company intends to produce 10,000 packages in total. They will be distributed to 40 CBD sales places in Switzerland and all the tank stations on the border between Italy and Switzerland. Two different forms of packaging were designed: a 12 gr box costs 50 CF and a 4 gr box costs 22 CF. A 12 gr box is specially made for about 40 special CBD stores in Switzerland, where the product is guaranteed to come into immediately after production. A 4 gr box is dedicated for selling in tank stations on the border between Switzerland and Italy. 
 
Market background 
 
In 2017, the Swiss legislation referring to production and sale of cannabis was changed, and thereby increased and legalized the level of THC to 1% for commercial cannabis production and sale. The new legislation gives companies the right (with proper authorization and licenses) to cultivate cannabis plants and distribute cannabis within in Switzerland. 
 
In February 2017, the Swiss health authorities established the legality of cannabis by indicating that "low-THC cannabis" would be taxed the same way tobacco is taxed, with a similar health warning. This type of cannabis is distributed under different brands. 
 
Sales of OTC cannabis cigarettes picked up pace in Bern and Zürich in the beginning of 2017, as more people started to use the product. 
 
Sales have increased radically, and the expectation is that the 2019 turnover from cannabis will be more than 500 million CHF (approximately 500 million USD) in Switzerland alone. 
 
Despite the increase in retailers, supply is lower than demand. Current providers could produce only approximately ¼ of the total Swiss market's demand in 2018. 
 
Swiss supermarket Coop Cooperative was the worlds first major chain to sell cannabis cigarettes that contain less than 1% THC in 2017, in its 700 stores across the country. In 2018, Lidl and other retailers joined in.
 
In August 2018, Forbes magazine listed Switzerland as the third most overlooked marijuana market in the world.
 
Competition
 
We know that there are a number of obstacles to entering the market of dung paper items and the competition is rather high. There are several companies that offer comparative items and we will have to compete with them. We see the main competitive advantage of our competitors is the established customer base and marketing outlets. Howbeit, we arrange on a wholesale exchange, for the most part, so we will have capacity to offer our item for extensive organizations in huge amounts. Therefore, we believe our item is more extensive, the quality is better, and our ways to deal with business are more flexible.
 
With regard to cannabis market, the Swiss market has a few big competitors now, the rest are small farms with under 1,000 plants in production and mostly outdoor. The big farms have more than 20,000 plants in indoor growing and from 10 to 50 Acres of outdoor growing. With the indoor growing it is very difficult to get good quality harvest, so a lot of small farms were closed in 2018 as it was not possible to make a profit with farms of 1,000 -3,000 plants.

Grow Factory has growers with many years of indoor growing experience. This results in the Company making about 20-grams of high-quality flowers heads per plant over an 8-week period.
 
The biggest issue in Switzerland is to find a landlord for indoor growing who accepts CBD production. Grow Factory currently manages a territory of 400 m2, but without approval of leased and commercial control of about 4,000 m2 for cultivation of cannabis in Switzerland. 
 
The prices on weed have been decreasing in Switzerland, so in order to get a part of the market, Grow Factory has to reduce the price and produce more hemp. 
 
A 12 gr flowerhead box costs 50 CF, so Grow Factory will sell 1 gr more than their competitors do for 50 CF and we believe the product is of a much higher quality. We believe Grow Factory will get a huge part of the CBD market when it is known by the customers. A 4 gr flowerhead box costs 22 CF. Competitors sell 3 or 3,5 gr. boxes at the same price. 
 Grow Factory sales price for its own product will almost be the same as they start selling to producers. It is extremely important for the Company to get them well-known and branded in Switzerland.
 
Marketing
 
We intend to use such marketing strategies as web advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We intend to attract traffic to our website by a variety of online marketing tactics such as registering with top search engines using selected key words and meta-tags, and utilizing link and banner exchange options. We will utilize numerous Internet showcasing instruments to direct activity to our site and distinguish potential clients. 
 As of this date, we have already purchased a website (www.geantcorp.com). Our site portrays samples of products which our Company is able to produce, the production procedure, and incorporates some broad data and pictures of high quality dung paper. We plan to utilize Internet advancement apparatuses on Facebook and Twitter to publicize our Company and make connections to our site. 
 The website related to cannabis cultivation is https://www.cannabissuisse.com. The growing process is streamed online on this website. Also it includes the information about the main Companys products, our team and our future plans of development.
 We will intend to continue our marketing efforts during the life of our operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and more importantly retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue and to successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed.
